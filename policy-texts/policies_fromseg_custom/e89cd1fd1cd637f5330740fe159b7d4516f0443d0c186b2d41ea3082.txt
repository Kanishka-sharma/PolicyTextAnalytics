Namecheap.com respects your privacy.
We have created this privacy 
              statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to you, our customer.
This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for this 
              site, www.namecheap.com.
==========
We do not give 3rd parties access to your personal information.
We only send e-mail or postal mail to you if you have elected 
                to receive it.
==========
*
If we find that any account with us is being used for the 
                purpose of sending spam, we take action to shut it down as soon 
                as possible.
Since domain name registration information is available to the 
              public, anyone can access it through "whois" searches.
At times our customers may have been included within these searches.
However, the spam they received does not in any way come from Namecheap.
==========
We will never give any information about you to others without 
              your express permission.
Our site uses forms in which you give us 
              contact information (like your name, address, and e-mail address) 
              so you can place orders, request information etc.
==========
We use your customer 
              information only when it will be important for us to contact you 
              regarding functionality changes to our products, our web site, new 
              services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.
If you 
              would rather not receive this information, please use the "Modify 
              Profile" account functionality to change your preferences any 
              time.
==========
We use information gathered about you from our site statistics 
              (for example your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our 
              server, and to administer our Web site.
We also gather broad demographic 
              information from this data to help us improve our site and make 
              your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable.
==========
This is 
              not linked to any personally identifiable information.
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your session information.
We also use cookies to store your username if you request to remember 
              you username during login.
That information will be used to pre-fill 
              the login form at a later time.
If you are referred to our website 
              through an ad or a partner, we will store the referral information 
              in the cookies.
==========
This site also contains links to other sites.
Unfortunately www.namecheap.com 
              is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such 
              Web sites.
==========
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse 
              and alteration of the information under our control.
We use 128 
              bit SSL security to encrypt any transmissions when you provide credit 
              card information etc.
==========
Sending Emails
              We use e-mails to communicate with you, to confirm your placed orders, 
              and to send information that you have requested etc.
We also provide 
              e-mail links, on bottom of most pages and our "Contact" 
              page, to allow you to contact us directly.
We strive to promptly 
              reply to your messages.
The information you send to us may be stored and used to improve 
              this site and our products, or it may be reviewed and discarded.
==========
However, your information will only be shared with third parties 
              with your explicit permission.
Only If We Have To
              As stated previously in this policy, we will never give out your 
              information without your permission.
==========
The only exceptions to this 
              are, when we are required by law, in the good-faith belief that 
              such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the 
              law, or we must comply with a legal process served on our web site.
Changes In Our Practices
              If we change our information handling practices or other privacy 
              aspects, we will post those changes on this privacy statement, at 
              least 7 days prior to their implementation.
==========
Please review our privacy 
              policies from time to time to know about the changes.
We may also 
              try to contact you through e-mail to notify you of the privacy changes 
              if necessary.
==========
Credit card Processor
              We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
              and services.
These companies do not retain, share, store or use 
              personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
If you would like to know more about privacy policies of our credit 
              card processing company, you may e-mail us at privacy@namecheap.com.
==========
Contests
              From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys 
              or contests.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely 
              voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to 
              disclose this information.
==========
Information requested may include contact 
              information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic 
              information (such as zip code, age level).
Contact information will 
              be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
Survey information 
              will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and 
              satisfaction of this site.
==========
Tell-A-Friend
              If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend 
              about our site, we ask them for the friendâ€™s name and e-mail 
              address.
Namecheap will automatically send the friend a one-time 
              e-mail inviting them to visit the site.
Namecheap doesn't store 
              this information in the database but use it just to send the one-time 
              e-mail.
