Description of personal data
Registration information
Your registration information is the information you submit when you sign up and create an account.
When you register, we will set a cookie on your browser so that when you come back to your account, you do not need to fill in all your registration details again, although you will have to supply your username and password.
For more information on other uses of cookies, click here.
==========
Connection information
Your connection information is information we automatically receive as a result of certain technical standards on the web – this includes the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our site or services.
We also receive the number of your mobile or the Internet protocol (IP) address used by your ISP for your connection (or the proxy server you use to access the web), your mobile handset model or computer operating system and type of browser you are using, as well as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, and your country of origin.
Usage information
Your usage information is the information we collect from and about your use of our products and services, such as the services and features you use, how often you sync your mobile, where you access the service from etc.
==========
This will be collected from all parts of the Vodafone 360 service, not just from those parts for which you have to register.
Browsing information
This is information that is collected as you browse content such as music, video, Apps, games on those services where such content is available for download and/or purchase.
It includes information about any content that you may have previewed without actually purchasing.
==========
Application management information
If you choose to download an Application to your handset or computer, we will be able to identify remotely which Application you have on your device, including which versions of those Applications.
This enables us to offer you upgrades to those applications so that you always have the latest version on your device.
You will be notified when an upgrade becomes available and will be offered the choice to upgrade or not, unless, when you first downloaded the Application, you chose not to be alerted about such upgrades.
However, please note that even if you have chosen not to be alerted to upgrades, your permission may still be requested if the upgrade introduces new and different features to those of the version you currently have on your handset.
This is to ensure that you have control over and understand what Applications you have on your device and what they can do.
If you choose not to receive alerts about upgrades to an Application, you will always be able to change your mind later and turn those alerts on – instructions on how to do this should be found in the Application itself.
==========
Purchase history
Information about your purchases, for example of Apps, content such as ringtone, games, music etc, will be collected and used so that we can make personalised recommendations to you about other products and services that we think may be of interest to you.
Information held by your Vodafone operator
Where your home network operator is part of the Vodafone global footprint, we may have access to information that they may already know about you and which they, depending on their privacy notice to you, may use to provide the product or service that you have requested, to enhance the product or service that you have chosen to use or tailor the content that you see.
If you wish to understand more about how they process your information, then you will need to contact them.

Disclosure
We may share information about you and your use of our products and services with companies within the Vodafone global footprint for the purposes set out in, and subject to the terms of, this Privacy Notice.
It may be necessary to share your personal information with third parties who are involved in the delivery of the products and services used by you.
For example, we may disclose your personal information to your network operator in order to provide you with more integrated services and features.
We do not – generally – rent, sell or disclose your personal information to third parties so that they can carry out their own marketing campaigns.
However, in exceptional circumstances, where we are providing specific service or specific content with another company, we may share your contact information with that company in order that they might contact you about their products and services.
In these exceptional circumstances, we will ensure that you are given clear and prior notice about this and we will provide you with information on how you can object to that happening.
If you buy products or services from a third party via us, we may need to pass that third party some information about you in order to ensure that you receive the product or service that you have requested, and to ensure that they can deal with any customer service issues that you may have about their product and service.
Those third parties will be contractually prohibited from using your information for their own marketing purposes, unless they have separately obtained permission from you to do so.
In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party for the purposes and subject to the terms of this Privacy Statement and our terms and conditions.
==========
From time to time Vodafone may be obliged by law or order of a court or other judicial or regulatory authority to disclose your personal information to meet any legal or regulatory obligations – for example the law enforcement agencies are able to require phone, internet and communications related information from us where it is relevant to their investigations into criminal activity.
Where that is the case we will only disclose your information to the extent strictly required by applicable law.
9.
==========
Outsourcing and international transfers
Where we have contracted with a third party to provide some part of our products or services that you are using, we will ensure that your personal information continues to be protected.
To do this we take the following steps:
Define the specific security measures that we require from our third party suppliers to protect your personal information – these security measures will be substantially similar to those deployed by us.
==========
We will also undertake checks, including physical audits where appropriate, to ensure that the third party supplier is capable of meeting our requirements.
Require our third party suppliers to process your information only as strictly authorised by us to fulfil the service that they have been contracted to provide on our behalf.
Those third parties will not be entitled to use your personal information for their own purposes.
Require them to sign a contract guaranteeing to comply with those security requirements and to only act upon our instructions, and agreeing that we can audit them to ensure that they comply with those security requirements.
==========
Where they are based outside of the EEA***, the data protection and other laws may not be as comprehensive or protective of your privacy as those in the EU.
In those cases, we take extra precautions to protect your privacy including considering the legal environment and the powers and practices of the governmental authorities in the destination country, and require our third party suppliers to enter into specific terms agreed with the European Commission to protect your personal information.
During the lifetime of the contract we will monitor for ongoing compliance with the defined security measures.
***The European Economic Area (EEA) currently comprises the Member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

The information you post or publish on our site or services, such as photos and comments, are your responsibility.
You need to be respectful of others' privacy and dignity, and ensure that if you post others' personal information on our site or services that you ensure you have their permission and respect their other rights to be treated fairly and decently.

==========
Identity thieves have been known to trawl social networks for information that enables them to complete a picture of a person's identity in conjunction with other information they obtain.
Only connect to people you know and trust.
This is why we allow you to only build your network around your phone address book, because this is primarily built from trusted connections.
==========
You do not have to use your real name, but if you do use your real name, please consider carefully what impact this might have on your privacy.
Note also that by making your information visible to other users, those other users may take a copy of your information or use it for purposes that you do not intend or expect.
==========
For example, new technologies can make use of information in unexpected ways, such as photo recognition and social matching techniques.
While we attempt to prevent any misuse of personal information by our users, we can't guarantee this.
If you subsequently hide information that was once visible, this may not remove it from the public domain if others have already seen or cached copies.
