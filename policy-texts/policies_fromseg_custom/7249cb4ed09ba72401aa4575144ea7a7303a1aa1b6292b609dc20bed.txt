Notice: Our Privacy Policy has Changed
Effective Date: September 27, 2016
Introduction
Clipcentric, Inc. ("Clipcentric", "We", "Us") provides marketing solutions that enable our customers (publishers, advertisers, ad agencies) to create and distribute a variety of digital advertisements ("Clipcentric Ads").
Clipcentric Ads are trafficked across a variety of websites and applications that are owned or operated by third parties ("Publishers").
Advertisers, Publishers, or other third parties who enter into a licensing agreement with Us ("Customers") may use this website (the "Site") as a point of entry to Customer-only software products and services ("Services").
Prospective Customers or those seeking information on our products and services may visit the Site to learn more about Us ("Site Visitors").
==========
We take the privacy concerns of Site Visitors and the viewers of advertisements created and served by our technology ("Ad Viewers") seriously.
This privacy policy governs Clipcentric's online information collection and use practices through: (i) Clipcentric Ads, (ii) the Site.
It also applies to any information a user may provide to Clipcentric or that Clipcentric may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, via telephone, or through the mail).
This privacy policy describes what information we collect, how it is used and the choices available regarding our use of personal information and how you can access and update this information.
Classification of Information
The information collection and use policies described in this document refer to two types of information: (i) Personally Identifiable Information and (ii) Non-Personally Identifiable Information, defined as follows:
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is information that can be used to contact, identify or precisely locate a person.
Examples of PII include, but are not limited to: name, email address, postal address, telephone number, social security number, government issued-identifier and credit card or other financial account number.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") is any information that is not, on its own, used to contact, identify or precisely locate a person.
Examples of Non-PII include browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows), and cookie data such as how many times a viewer has seen an ad or ad component.
==========
Information Collection and Storage Methods
This section provides a brief summary of the information collection technologies referred to in this document.
Details on how these technologies are used to collect information from Site Visitors and Ad Viewers can be found in the following sections:
Clipcentric Information Collection and Use Policy for Site Visitors
Clipcentric Information Collection and Use Policy for Ad Viewers
Other Clipcentric Information Collection and Use Policies
Html Forms
Html Forms are input fields where users may enter information that is collected by the host application.
Html forms may request Personally Identifiable Information, and it is up to the user whether or not to enter such information.
For example, Html forms are often used for user registrations and "Contact Us" information requests, where the user supplies contact information in order to be contacted by email, telephone or other means.
Http Cookies
Http Cookies (also known as browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small files that are stored on a user's computer via a web browser.
==========
They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular browser (e.g. Firefox) and website (i.e. domain).
Cookies are used because they are a convenient way of carrying information from one session on a website to another, or between sessions on related websites.
A cookie consists of (i) a name, by which it is referenced, (ii) the domain to which it is attached, i.e. facebook.com or tr.clipcentric.com, (iii) a number of key/value pairs, such as loggedin=yes or gender=male, and (iv) its duration, or how long before the cookie is deleted, e.g. when the browser window is closed, 90 days or forever.
You can view or delete any cookies that are stored by your browser using browser tools.
==========
Server Log Files
Server Log Files contain a list of requests received by a webserver or delivery network.
Almost all the websites you visit, or any of the applications you access online generate log files that may include visitor IP addresses, operating systems, browsers type, referring/exit pages, ISP and device information.
This information is typically used to monitor site/application traffic, usage patterns and trends, timestamps and clickstream data, as well as to troubleshoot errors and problem areas.
IP Address
An IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet service provider (ISP) or by another organization.
IP Addresses are commonly stored in Server Log Files.
An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally.
However, when combined with other information, your IP address can be used to identify the computer you are using.
Your IP address may also be used to estimate your geographic location.
==========
User Agent Strings
User Agent Strings are a series of characters automatically sent with your Internet requests that provide information necessary for smooth Internet communications such as the operating system and browser you used.
User Agent Strings are commonly stored in Server Log Files.
Similar to an
IP address, a user agent string, by itself, does not identify you personally.
However, when combined with other information, a user agent string might be used to identify the computer originating a message.
Unique IDs
Unique IDs are identification numbers or strings that are used to identify a particular user or device.
Unique IDs may be created based upon Clipcentric Server Log Files, including IP Addresses and User Agent Strings, or be passed to Clipcentric from third parties.
Unique IDs may be truly unique to a user, browser, device or platform, or may rely on statistical methods to correlate users, browsers, devices or platforms with user activity.
==========
Tracking Pixels
Tracking Pixels (also known as Clear Gifs, Web Beacons) are invisible 1x1 pixel images that are requested from a remote server.
When a Tracking Pixel is requested from a server, that server then has the opportunity to interact with the website visitor's browser for the purposes of using other information collection methods, such as setting or reading a Http Cookie or creating Server Log Files.
Embedded Scripts
Embedded scripts are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with a website or website component (including advertisements), such as the links you click on.
Embedded Scripts may be temporarily downloaded onto your device from an application's web server, or the server of a third party provider.
An Embedded Script is active only while you are connected to the website containing the embedded script, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
==========
Local Storage
Local Storage is another method of storing information locally on a user's computer, via a web browser.
Storing information using Local storage is similar to using a Http Cookie, but allows for the storing of a greater amount of data with improved performance and increased security, as no information is transferred from the browser to a web server.
Local Storage may be cleared at the end of a browser session (Session Storage), or be stored indefinitely (until removed by an application or end-user).
Like Http Cookie, Local Storage is per origin (per domain and protocol).
==========
All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.
Local Shared Objects
Local Shared Objects, also known as Flash® cookies, is a method of storing information utilizing the Adobe Flash® player.
Flash cookies are different from Http Cookie because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
For example, Local Shared Objects can be stored or retrieved for a particular domain whenever a user accesses a page containing a Flash application.
While this "same domain restriction" is similar to that of Http Cookie, Local Shared Objects are persistent across sessions using different browsers (e.g. Chrome and MSIE).
Local Shared Objects are commonly used to store preferences, track application data (such as game stats) or track a user's activity within the domain.
Click-through Redirects
A Click-through Redirect is a method for a third party to track a click on an advertisement.
Rather than the ad click immediately resulting in your browser opening the target webpage, your request is "relayed" or "redirected" through an intermediary webserver, which can then store information pertaining to the click-through in Server Log Files.
==========
Device Location
Your Device Location is available via the W3C Geolocation API Specification (see https://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html).
Common sources of location information include Global Positioning System (GPS) and location inferred from network signals such as IP address, RFID, WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, and GSM/CDMA cell IDs, as well as user input.
While no guarantee is given that the API returns the device's actual location, the availability of accurate location information is sufficient for your Device Location to be considered Personally Identifiable Information.
Your Device Location cannot be determined without your explicit consent, e.g. responding "yes" to a prompt asking permission to use your current location.
==========
Information Collection and Use Policy for Site Visitors
Information Collection Methods and Use
Clipcentric does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information of Site Visitors before, during or after your visit to this Clipcentric.com website other than what you voluntarily supply to us via Html forms (e.g., submitting information through the Contact Us and/or registration forms).

Third Parties may embed their own Tracking Pixels within Clipcentric Ads.
We do not monitor, know or control how those third parties are using such Tracking Pixels.
==========

We use this communication to enable custom ad experiences particular to a Publisher, or to pass other information to the Clipcentric Ad that can be used for reporting and analytics.
If a Clipcentric Ad contains Adobe Flash® components, we may use Local Shared Objects to customize a Clipcentric Ad, or to control the ad experience across multiple ad views.
==========
We use Click-through Redirects to allow us to track click activity on Clipcentric Ads, or to allow our Customers and other third parties to track such activity.
Click-through Redirect activity is stored in our Server Log files, and is analyzed in conjunction with other information to produce reports on the effectiveness of Clipcentric Ads for our Customers.
