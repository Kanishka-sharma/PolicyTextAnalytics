LOCALSENSOR PLATFORM PRIVACY POLICY
Effective date: April 12th, 2018

KEY TAKEAWAYS
How did you get here?
You are probably using an app serving you news, weather data, traffic information or the like.
The owner of the app maintains
				the app by means of serving you ads.
This way the app can be offered for a lower fee or no fee at all.
How is Localsensor involved in this?
Localsensor helps advertisers to show great engaging ads to persons like you based on what we think you might find interesting.
==========
That is what we call interest-based advertising.
What do you mean by 'interest' in interest-based advertising?
We do our best to serve you ads that appeal to you.
E.g. if you visit a city more than average we might serve you ads
				that show you local deals for that particular city.
==========
We are not interested in you personally (sorry :-/).
We only try to reach large groups
				who might find something more interesting.
This way you get more relevant ads.
You are not selling my data to other parties, right?
No, and we will never do so.
We only use your data to serve you great ads through our platform.
==========
When did I gave my consent for this?
When you installed the app or at any other time the app asked you for your consent for advertising in this app.
If I want to reconsider all of this, where do I start?
You have the right to revoke your consent at any time.
==========
You can also reset your Advertiser Identifier in your device and
				your Advertiser Identifier link to segments will be wiped out completely.
You also have the right to get the segments
				we have linked your device Advertiser Identifier with.
Please drop us an email at
				privacy@localsensor.com

How can I manage my Advertiser ID?
Your Advertiser Identifier (ID) is directly managed by the operating system of your device being either android or iOS.
For iOS you could visit the following link:
				https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074
				and for Android you could go to:

B. LOCALSENSOR'S PLATFORM PRIVACY PRACTICES
WHAT PERSONAL DATA DOES LOCALSENSOR COLLECT AND PROCESS?
The personal data we use on our Platform includes data regarding your device (such as resettable Advertiser Identifier,
			device location and IP-address) and also data regarding operating system, network provider, device location, device model,
			the used app and interaction with the served advertisement.
We are keen to limit the collection of personal data to the bare minimum and make the data less specific to prevent personal
			identification with the data as much as possible.
FOR WHAT PURPOSES DO WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA?
On our Platform, we use the personal data we receive from our business partners for limited and well-defined purposes:
		
(1) Programmatic Ad Buying and Ad Serving

			based on our clients advertising objectives.

If your personal data includes location data we might use this data to support the decision whether or not to advertise
			based on map data.
c.
==========
We also might adapt the advertisement shown based on your personal data.
(2) Interest-based Segments
On our Platform, we also use personal data to create segments.
We process your personal data to improve the segments on
			our Platform.
For this we use the pseudonymised Advertiser Identifier on your device.
We use location data, IP-address, app and publicly available
			data, like statistical governmental data, to update our segments.
This helps us to provide you with even more relevant
			advertisements in the future.
We provide our clients with filtering options to manage the advertisements that are displayed
			to you and to target specific segments of users of the apps.
We will not create segments to such a degree that they can be linked to a single or small group of
			pseudonymised advertiser identifiers.
We will also never allow segments be used to harm your personal interests or interest of a group and we will also never allow segments 
			to be used limit your fundamental rights and freedoms.
==========
ON WHAT LEGAL BASIS DO WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA?
For purpose (1) Programmatic Ad Buying and Ad Serving we only process your personal data if you gave your consent to 
			our business partners in their app.
For purpose (2) Interest-based Segments we build segments in such a broad way that your personal interests and 
			fundamental rights and freedoms are safeguarded.
The legal basis for this is a legitimate interest of Localsensor to 
			be able to help our clients to serve you ads in a much more efficient way so you get more relevant ads.

For Ad Buying and Ad Serving (purpose 1) we will delete your personal data after 24 hours.

We use hashing, encryption, pseudonymisation and de-identification techniques to ensure that the personal data in our segment
			database can in no way be linked to you as a person.
This allows us to only identify your device for the purposes of providing
			our service and prevents your data being used to identify you in real life, either by us, our clients or our business
			partners.

We don't share your personal data we receive from our business partners with our advertising clients.
We only share aggregate,

			also share data from our database with our publishing partners.

			contracts.
