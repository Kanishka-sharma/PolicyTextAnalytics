To send product related and similar product and services communications:  for certain types of marketing communications, we do not require your consent and we instead rely on our legitimate interest.
This is the case for example where we send you postal advertising or where we send you ‘in-life’ communications about products or services that we provide to you.
You can opt out of these communications either by visiting your preference centre if you have an account or in the communication itself.
We may send you service-related messages, which are about the service we provide.
We do not require your consent for these, and you are not able to opt out.

==========
Facilitate posting, commenting and interaction: If you correspond with any of our titles or radio stations, or interact with other customers or audience members or our staff, for example by using polls, comments, text messages, video, email, phone, radio or by post, we may display this content indefinitely in any relevant context, subject to our editorial judgement and your rights as set out in this Policy.
This may be anonymised in the case of testimonials or customer service conversations.
If you take part in any reader or listener forums, send us letters for publication, or take part in any radio 'phone-ins', then you may be identifiable to others publicly and your comments attributed to you.

In the case of some of our digital radio stations, when listening online, we and our partners may insert a relevant audio advert for you to listen to.
Audience segmentation and creation: we may use the information we hold about you, including how you engage with our products and services, as well as from other sources, to segment our audiences into groups with particular attributes (likes/dislikes/reading behaviours etc).
==========
This helps us personalise your experience and show you more relevant content and adverts.
Cookie matching/syncing: When you visit our sites, we may check your device to see if a cookie ID has been assigned to it.
This is a form of identifier that tells us who is visiting our sites.
We are then able to compare the cookie ID we have for you with IDs that our advertisers hold to see if we both know who you are.
By knowing it is you (or your device), the advertiser can decide if they want to advertise to you and if so, what advertising would be relevant.
See the section on Cookies & Similar Technologies for more information.
==========
Data matching: From time to time we may allow our clients to compare their customer database to ours.
This is called data matching and allows our partners to see if they can reach their audiences on our platforms.
Generally this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights.
These insights might include the overlap between our audiences and the client and other information that would be useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.
==========
As part of the data matching process we may allow partners to build target audiences based on pre-defined attributes.
These ‘lookalike’ audiences may be similar to our partners’ existing audiences.
For example, a sports brand may want to reach ‘sports enthusiasts’ or those who enjoy ‘outdoor pursuits’.
==========
They could select audiences who have been identified as having an interest in these areas.
To do this, we segment our audiences into groups depending on what we think they like or other behaviours.
This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.
==========
Detect ad blockers: We may collect information from your devices that tells us whether you are using an ad blocker.
This is so that we can manage our compliance with the law and also determine if we are able to show you advertising.
We may also ask you to suspend or whitelist our sites so that we can show you adverts.
As a predominantly advertising funded business, we do rely on our ability to show you advertising to help ensure we are able to provide you with the products and services you request.
