Privacy Policy
Our goal is to make Kayak the most trusted site in
online travel.
To do this, we need your help, so any suggestions for
improvement can be sent to us directly via the 
privacy feedback form.
Kayak is a search engine that saves you time and money.
We
search the web for the best fares and rates; and then you go directly
to a travel supplier's website to make your purchase.
So, this means
we do not take your credit card information and we do not take your
hard earned money.
Registration on Kayak is strictly voluntary.
==========
You
do get some cool information and access to certain great features if
you do register, but membership is not necessary to get our great
rates and fares.
What's Your Sign?
Kayak collects personally identifiable information (PII, or
"Your Info") that you provide to us.
This includes (at your
discretion) your name, an email address, and a password.
Our software
uses the PII to personalize and manage the Kayak website for you.
For
example, our site stores your favorite airport and airlines.
==========
If you
do decide to give us this information, you are telling us that this
information is both true and accurate.
Also, you are telling us that
you have the authorization to provide us with that information.
In order to make our site more efficient, we may also collect
certain non PII information (such as destination or site usage
behavior) based on your use of Kayak.
We may use this information to
display advertising that you find interesting and suppress advertising
that you might find boring or annoying.
For example, we might show
you travel offers from your home airport, but not those from airports
that are other places in the country.
To help us debug problems with our software (rare as they are), we
may collect some technical information from your browser software
(such as Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer), screen resolution and
the website that referred you to us.
==========
We'll Keep You In The Loop
When you choose to register with us, Kayak logs you in
automatically using your email address.
This makes it easier for you
as you don't have to create and remember a login identifier.
The use
of your email address for login also allows Kayak the chance to email
you a new password in case you forget or lost your old one.
This is
perfectly OK and happens to the best of us, particularly those of us
that are incredibly busy.
