All of the information SportsLine.com collects, both what you tell us and what we collect through the use of cookies, is "aggregated" -- meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user.
We may use this aggregated information to evaluate which products and services are successful and which ones are not, and in order to evaluate which new services we should make available on our Web sites.
We may use only the anonymous click stream data to help our advertisers deliver better-targeted advertisements.

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.
A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited.
But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.
Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site.
A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are.
We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.
We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID.
Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and password during a session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to reenter it repeatedly during that session.
Users should be aware that SportsLine.com cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for SportsLine.com.
==========
If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies maybe necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the SportsLine.com network of websites.

Users may opt out of receiving future mailings in Personal Options.

In those cases, we urge users to review the privacy statement of the third party site.
