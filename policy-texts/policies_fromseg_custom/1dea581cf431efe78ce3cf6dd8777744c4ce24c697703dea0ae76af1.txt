Privacy & Compliancy
Last Updated: April 2018
This privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) explains how DMA Institute (“DMAI” or “we”, “us” or “our”) collects and utilizes personal data when you use our online services (“DMAI Services”) or visit our website (the “Website”).
This privacy statement relates to personal data we collect about individuals who use our DMAI Services – Reporting Dashboard and/or who visit our Website (whom we will refer to as “You”, “your”, or “customer”).
When we process personal data, we act as data controllers under applicable data protection law, meaning that we process the data for our own purposes, and not on behalf of our customers.
As a data controller, we must inform you what we do with your data and also provide certain other information.
We do this in this Privacy Statement.
DMAI Services consist mainly of online advertisement effectiveness tracking and analytics services for market research purposes.
This means we measure for our customers if and how long an ad has been visible in an active screen of a user.
In order to provide the DMAI Services, we will process data on online consumers on behalf of our customers, using cookies and other technologies.
In doing so, we act as a data processor under applicable data protection law.
Although “You”, “your”, or “customer” refers to our customers and not to individuals whose data we collect as part of our online advertisement effectiveness tracking and analytics, we recognize the rights of these individuals (whom we will refer to as “Data Subjects”) and encourage Data Subjects to read the Privacy Policy focused on the processing for those Data Subjects to learn how we may process their personal data.
==========
We collect data that you may provide to us in the course of using the Website or the DMAI Services, which we will use to provide the service you have requested and to improve the Website and the DMAI Services.
For example:

DMAI communications: you may provide us with personal information when you submit an online form, apply for a job, communicate with us via e-mail.
This information may include your name; business or personal contact information, such as your email address or phone number; and any information that you provide us as part of a communication to us.
==========
Reporting Dashboard: as part of the DMAI Services, you will have access to the online dashboard we provide (the “Reporting Dashboard”).
We save your email address and your username, in order to provide our Dashboard service.
All passwords are “hashed”.
Newsletter: we will use your email address to send you our newsletter with regular reports and other current news.
You may unsubscribe from this newsletter at any time by sending an email to unsubscribe@dma-institute.com.
==========
We automatically collect certain information about your use of the Website and the Reporting Dashboard.
Every time the Website is accessed, information is saved, which the user’s browser sends to our server.
This may include, for example, the IP address of the computer, the date and time of the visit, the browser type/version.
The data is collected and processed for security purposes, to improve the user-friendliness of our online presence, and, in aggregated form, for statistical purposes.
IP addresses are only analysed when our network structure (servers, for example) is attacked or an attempted attack is detected.
This data is deleted as soon as this analysis is completed, unless we need to retain it as evidence for taking legal action.
==========
Our Website automatically creates logs regarding your activity on our Website.
These logs may identify the features that you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you access.
We generally use this information in aggregate formats to assess statistics on the effectiveness of our Website and the DMAI Services and to better understand your priorities and interests.
This information is deleted on a regular basis, when it is no longer needed for these purposes.
==========
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the performance of the agreement between you and DMAI, or, if you work for a customer, the legitimate interests DMAI has in processing your data in order to provide the Online Services to your employer.
We use cookies (small data files placed on your device) and similar technologies to provide our DMAI Services and to collect information about your use of the Website and the Reporting Dashboard.
Cookies allow us, among other things, to ensure authorized access to the Reporting Dashboard, to store your preferences and settings to the DMAI Services.
We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data.
Our website may include web beacons and cookies from third-party services providers like Google Analytics.
Please note that you may be able to view and delete cookies using the features of your browser; however, deleting cookies may prevent you from being able to use the full functionality of the Website.
==========
We may transfer your personal data to suppliers that we use to provide the Website and the DMAI Services.
For example, your data may be processed by a provider of financial services for billing and payment purposes.
We will only share your personal with other third parties if we are legally obliged to, or if we have asked for, and where you have given consent.
==========
Buttons for Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter are integrated in to our website.
The logo of each company is used for the corresponding button.
As soon as you actively click on one of these buttons, a new window opens, and you will be forwarded to the page of our corresponding social media profile.
This also establishes a direct connection between your browser and the social media’s server and sends a message that your IP address has visited our website.
If you are also a user of the social media provider and are logged in to your account, they are also able to see that your social media profile visited our website.
==========
We have no influence on the collection or use of your data carried out by the social media providers.
For more information on their individual data protection policies, click here: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter.
DMAI recognizes that you have the following rights in relation to your information:

The right to obtain, at reasonable intervals and free of charge, confirmation as to what personal data about them are processed by DMAI;
The right to object to processing of personal data about them for DMAI’s own marketing purposes;
The right to have personal data about them rectified, blocked or deleted if the data are incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, outdated or processed unlawfully;
The right to object to processing based on their particular situation; and
The right to receive the personal data about them which they have provided to DMAI in a structured and commonly used format and to transmit those data to another controller

When you exercise your right to request deletion of your data, we may not be able to comply with this to the extent that we must keep your information for legitimate business or legal reasons.
Also, the deletion of some of your data may require us to deactivate your account, as we are no longer able to provide the DMAI Services after deletion of your data.
==========
If you wish to make a request based on the above, please inform us by sending an email to [email].
We may request evidence of your identity for verification purposes.
We will respond to your request within the applicable statutory term.
==========
DMAI retains information about you and your end users for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected the data, except if required otherwise by law.
We may store information for longer periods for archiving or statistical purposes in which case we will take appropriate measures (including aggregation of data) to ensure that the information is used solely for this purpose.
If you do not agree with the way DMAI processes information about you, and you reside in the EU, you can lodge a complaint to a competent supervisory authority in your country of residence.
==========
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion.
Any such changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting.
If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “Last Updated” date above.
