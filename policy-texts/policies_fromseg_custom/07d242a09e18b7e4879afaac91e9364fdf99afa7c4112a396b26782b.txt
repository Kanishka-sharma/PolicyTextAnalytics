USE OF COOKIES, OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AND GATHERING OF STATISTICAL DATA
We use "cookies" and other statistical and tracking technologies as described in this Section.
A cookie is a piece of information that our website sends to your browser, which then stores this information on your system.
Other statistical and tracking technologies, such as web beacons, clear gifs, HTTP headers, also work in ways that collect information about your visit and use of Verisign's websites.
We use these technologies in four ways:
To provide a service: A cookie may be used to provide you with a specific service.
==========
For instance, if you request our site to remember your login password or remember your profile in a response to a blog post, we deposit a cookie on your computer to facilitate that service.
If you are logging into an access-controlled section of our site, we set a temporary session cookie to establish that you have been authenticated.
The information contained in these cookies consists of random data that is used by the server to authenticate the browser requests to the server for that particular session.
These cookies do not include any type of personally identifiable information.
This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window.
==========
If you choose not to accept a temporary cookie, you will not be able to navigate in these online applications.
We also use a cookie for when you visit our website and request documentation or a response from us.
When you are filling out a form, you may be given the option of having our Website deliver a cookie to your local hard drive.
You might choose to receive this type of cookie in order to save time in filling out forms and/or revisiting our website.
==========
We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have clicked on the box labeled "Please remember my information" or another box with an equivalent content when submitting information or communicating with us.
To facilitate website use: If a cookie is used, our website will be able to remember information about your preferences and movement either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie.
==========
For instance, we may deposit a cookie to remember which of Verisign’s regional websites you have selected to access.
Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a website as seamlessly as possible.
You should be aware that cookies are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the sender personal information from your computer.
==========
If you are accessing our services through one of our online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our site.
The information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to show when you hit the back button in your browser.
This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window.
==========

We may monitor statistics and other data such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come, which browsers people use and how they move about our website.
We use this data about your visit for aggregation purposes only.
These statistics are used to help us to understand our visitors’ interests and improve the content and performance of our website.
If you come to our site from one of our business partners, our Web server may also send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an origination code for that business partner.
We use this information for statistical and marketing purposes.
We also use a cookie when we track traffic patterns on our site.
Analysis of the collected information by our tracking technologies allows us to improve our website and the user experience.
==========
In both instances of a persistent cookie, if you choose not to accept the cookie, you will still be able to use our website.
Even if you choose to receive this type of cookie, you can always set your browser to notify you when you receive any cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it in each situation in which one is sent.
==========
We may supplement this unidentified user data with other data to better understand our users.
For instance, we may relate a user’s IP address to the company to which it relates to better understand our visitors’ interests.
==========
To advertise: We may tailor our advertisements to certain users based on the unidentified user data and related information.
Also, we may receive information on unidentified users’ movements on other websites to tailor advertisements to them on our website and, likewise, provide unidentified user information to service providers, such as an ad agency, who places our advertisements on other websites to market to these users that visit them.
You can opt out of this tracking by accessing the link below.
You will need to invoke these opt-out procedures on each computer you use.
If you opt out, you may still see Verisign advertisements on other websites you visit, but these ads are not user specific and are not placed because of your past website use.

Occasionally these updates or other important information may be sent out by third parties on our behalf.

We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
In addition, Verisign may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply Verisign's agreements.

In order to support security of the Internet, we are required to offer the WHOIS service with respect to the top-level domains (such as .

==========
name) for which we are the registry.
This service allows you or anyone else to determine the availability of domain names and the contact information for the registrar who registered a domain name on behalf of a registrant.
In some instances, we are required to operate a "thick," or extensive, WHOIS service that typically contains the registrant’s name, contact person's name, address, telephone number, email address, and/or IP address as provided to us by the registrar for the domain name.
Via the WHOIS service, this information may be disclosed to unaffiliated third parties in order to determine the registrant or the registrar in case of (i) technical problems that might occur when accessing its domain; (ii) assisting law enforcement authorities in investigations, crime prevention, and matters of national security; (iii) helping to counter the infringement of third-party legal rights; and (iv) preventing fraud.
==========
However, Verisign publishes only that data necessary for the purposes described above or when the registrant has agreed to the publication.
E. Business Transitions
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Verisign decides to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses or business units in some countries.
==========
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers.
It is Verisign's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
==========
F. Surveys
From time to time, we may request information from customers via surveys.
Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with this website, and improving our customer service and product offerings.
