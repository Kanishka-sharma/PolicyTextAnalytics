1.
What data we collect and why
Our vision at Ebates is to maximize the rewards for all of our members and to provide them with as many benefits as possible.
The first key way in which we provide value is to forward the commissions we receive from our merchants to you.
Instead of keeping these funds for ourselves, we make our money primarily from marketing partnerships with our merchants, and advertising.
When first registering with Ebates, you will be asked to provide your name, address, income and age.
This information helps us understand your interests and develop an understanding of what might appeal to you.
==========
Based on these demographics, we are able to determine what types of merchants and specials would benefit our members most.
When a member shops or visits one of our merchants, Ebates may track this information to have a summary of our member's buying interests.
This information will be used by Ebates to make relevant and personalized offers to our members.
As with any other information that you supply to Ebates, none of the information that we collect will be released in any personally identifiable way, only in aggregate or anonymous form.

How your information is used
We collect information to provide better, more relevant offers to you, whether it is targeted advertising, new merchants that we think our members may like, or choosing new partnerships.

Who sees your personal information
Only a very limited number of Ebates employees ever have access to your personal information.
Primarily this information is accessed to provide customer service or to send you your Big Fat Check.
We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site.
If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services.

Whenever you access any of your account pages or change any of your user information, it is done over an SSL connection to Ebates.
In spite of the fact that all important data is sent over an SSL connection, you may notice that on merchant pages, the "padlock" icon in the corner of your browser sometimes does not appear.
