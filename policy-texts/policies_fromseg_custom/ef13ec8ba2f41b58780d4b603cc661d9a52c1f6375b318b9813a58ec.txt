How We Collect Information through Our Services
We collect information through the use of cookies, advertising IDs, pixels and other technologies.
A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a browser by a web site or ad server which allows that web site or ad server to recognize that browser and remember user preferences and other information.
An advertising ID is an alphanumeric identifier made available by a platform or operating system (such as Apple iOS or Google Android) that allows application developers and third parties to recognize a particular device in an application environment and remember User Information (defined below) and other information.
==========
A pixel is a line of code that is used by a Site or third party to assign online activities to a device or browser.
The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a device or browser has visited a particular Site or page.
Additional information from an earlier period or interaction, which may include User Information intended to provide users with more useful and relevant online advertising, may also be associated with such device or browser.
We may collect and utilize information about users and activities across different Sites, and associate it across applicable devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the same user.
We may also utilize information that we receive from other companies, and associate it with information we collect and across applicable devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the same user.
==========
These practices are intended to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant ads regardless of device or browser.
How We Use Information Collected through Our Services
We use the information collected through our Services to help ensure that you receive the most useful and relevant online advertising you see on Sites (including on web sites in a browser environment and/or in applications, and on other devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the device and/or browser where the information was collected) (we refer to customized advertising based on users’ interests, demographic information, prior activity, and similar information (“User Information”), as “Interest-Based Advertising”).
