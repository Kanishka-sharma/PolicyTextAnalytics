Last Updated: December, 30th 2019
LiveIntent (“LiveIntent,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) offers two types of services to our customers: Identity Services, Marketing and Advertising Services.
This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how LiveIntent collects and uses information in connection with our Marketing and Advertising Services (“Services”), which include supporting our customers’ interest-based advertising activities and efforts to monetize digital advertising inventory.
Interest-based advertising is the process of serving advertisements that are tailored to your likely interests.

==========
For individuals residing in the EU, we process information relating to individuals or devices on behalf of and pursuant to the instructions of our customers, as set forth in our agreements with them.
In other jurisdictions, where permitted by law, our business partners may give us permission to use information collected through their emails, mobile applications, or websites for our own purposes, including to deliver our Identity Services.

==========
This Policy does not describe how we collect and use information in relation to activities and offerings other than the Services, such as our websites, events, marketing efforts, and other programming.
For information on how LiveIntent uses information collected in relation to such activities, please click here.
What information do we collect?
==========
We are in the business of helping our business partners provide consumers with useful content in a way that respects your right to privacy.
Even though the information we collect through the Services may be considered “personal data” or “personal information” under certain laws, we do not know your name, address, your place of work, your date of birth, your phone number, or other information used to identify you as a specific individual (“personally identifiable information” or “PII”), and we do not collect this information unless you choose to provide it.
In order for LiveIntent to deliver the Services, our business partners may provide information from online or offline sources to LiveIntent including the types described below.
Collecting this information allows our business partners to send you interest-based advertisements and to measure the success of these advertisements.
The types of non-PII personal information we may collect in order to provide our Services include:

User Identifiers and Device Information: We may collect identifiers that are used by our business partners, but LiveIntent does not see any PII connected with these identifiers.
To de-identify this information, a mathematical process (commonly known as hashing) is performed to convert the information into a code.
We do not knowingly retain any PII connected with the code.
==========
We may also collect information related to devices used to access our business partners’ emails and websites, such as the visitor’s device type, operating system, version, IP address, and technical identifiers such as a mobile advertising ID (Apple IDFA or Google AAID).
Demographic and Profile Information:  We may be provided demographic and other profile information such as annual income, buying preferences, age range, and gender.
Network Activity Information:  We may collect information related to your use of email sent by one of our business partners, such as whether the email has been opened, or a link has been clicked in the email.
We also collect information about activity on our business partners’ websites, such as the time users spend on their website, from which other websites users came, and what other websites users visit.
Commercial information:   We may collect information about commercial activities, such as whether you purchased a product or service after viewing a related advertisement.
Geolocation Information:   We may collect and process information about your general location.
The information we collect may tell us which zip code you are in, but it does not tell us your precise location.
Inferences:   We may use the information we collect to generate certain inferences, such as associations between identifiers.
Information collected from our business partners also continues to be governed by any applicable privacy policies of our business partners.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each website you visit and mobile applications you use.
To collect the information described above, we and our service providers may use cookies, which are small text files that online services often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their sites.
A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your device when a user of your computer or mobile device returns to a website that it has visited previously.
==========
Websites and other digital content also may contain small, transparent images, files, or lines of code that collect information about how you interact with the pages, emails, advertisements, and apps.
For example, these technologies may collect information about the web pages you visit, the content you view, when and for how long you interact with certain features, and whether you respond to advertisements.
We may use these technologies to identify your computer or device (which can help us or our service providers recognize you when you return), store information about your preferences (e.g., preferred language), log your interactions (e.g., the types of messages you prefer to receive), and present you with more relevant interest-based advertisements.
We retain this information in a form that can identify your computer or device for up to 180 days.
