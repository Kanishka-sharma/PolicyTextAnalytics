INTRODUCTION
DoubleVerify, Inc. (“DoubleVerify”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is the industry leader in providing transparency and accountability in online advertising.
==========
Our accredited platforms provide independent digital media measurement, data and analytics about advertisement (or “ad”) impression delivery and website traffic, to help advertisers and advertising inventory sellers (together “Customers”) confirm accurate delivery characteristics, including brand safety, viewability metrics, contextual and environmental parameters (for example, the website on which an ad appears, and where it appears on the webpage), ad impression and website traffic quality characteristics, and provide insights that allow our Customers to make informed decisions about the placement of their creative and brand.
DoubleVerify uses various technologies to collect information about online advertising, website traffic, mobile app traffic, and connected device traffic in order to deliver advertising transparency and accountability products and solutions to our Customers (collectively, “Solutions”).
==========
We believe in providing strong privacy protections to any individual whose information we may process in any capacity – because we believe privacy is a fundamental right, not something that should depend on where you may live.
To live up to that principle, we treat any data that relates or is linked to an identified or identifiable individual as “Personal Information” regardless of that individual’s location.
As it relates to our Solutions, DoubleVerify limits any information we collect to “pseudonymous information” which is information that does not allow the identification of an individual without additional information.
An example of “pseudonymous information” that DoubleVerify processes is your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when the Internet is used.
==========
While DoubleVerify treats “pseudonymous information” as Personal Information, we never combine that “pseudonymous information” with any other data that would enable us to identify the individual.
This notice of privacy practices (the “Solutions Privacy Notice”) is intended to inform individuals whose data may be processed through our Solutions (“End User(s)” or, “you” and “your”) of : (1) the types of information DoubleVerify may gather about you or your device when an advertisement that is analyzed by us is delivered to you on a website you are viewing or in an app you are using, (2) our privacy practices, how we may use, share, and otherwise process information that is deemed Personal Information, and (3) what your rights are with regards to such Personal Information.
This Solutions Privacy Notice also explains what non-personal information (“Technical Information”) we collect about the ads that we track and how we use that Technical Information to power our Solutions.
2.
==========
ROLE, PURPOSE AND LEGAL BASIS OF PROCESSING
DoubleVerify’s Solutions include fraud elimination (“Fraud Elimination”) and geography compliance verification (“Geo Verification”), which require the processing of Personal Information.
DoubleVerify operates Fraud Elimination as a “controller” or “business” and Geo Verification as a “processor” or “service provider”.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in limited circumstances where DoubleVerify does not directly collect Personal Information and such Personal Information is collected and provided by a Customer for DoubleVerify’s analysis (for example as it relates to some of our partnerships with social media Customers), we may serve as a “processor” or “service provider” at all times.
DoubleVerify’s legal basis for processing Personal Information through our Solutions is the legitimate interest of: (i) our Customers to avoid ad-related fraud and present geographically accurate and compliant information to End Users, (ii) the End Users in receiving fraud-free and geographically accurate and compliant information, and (iii) the general public in the continued availability of a free internet.
3.
==========
WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES?
DoubleVerify, to carry out its business purposes of providing, maintaining and improving its Solutions collects and uses certain categories of Personal Information and Technical Information.

To the extent Personal Information is required for the operation of one or more features of a DoubleVerify Solution, such Personal Information will be used only for the specific purposes outlined below, unless otherwise required by law.
Additionally, in some circumstances, it may be necessary to process the Personal Information in conjunction with some Technical Information for DoubleVerify’s Solutions to properly function.
==========
In any such scenarios, the combined data is considered Personal Information and protected accordingly.
We never combine, analyze or enrich the Personal Information and Technical Information we process with additional information with the goal of identifying the End Users.
We never track you or your online activities across apps and websites or over time, we do not rely on persistent technologies such as third-party cookies and we never create profiles or audience groups to target individuals.
==========
Categories of Technical Information collected and used to power the DoubleVerify Solutions:
Advertising campaign attributes – The identifier of the advertiser that delivers an ad, its campaign and placement identifiers, the identifiers of the media property selling the inventory to the advertiser or any intermediary advertising platform are collected and processed to identify the Customer we are servicing, to apply the correct settings for the Customer, to segment the Customer reports according to these identifiers and to bill the Customer.
Web content attributes – The web address (URL) of the page/frame where the ad is being delivered to, and the address of any referring pages/frames are collected to ensure the ads are delivered in the right context our Customer has set in the profile settings in our system.
Mobile application attributes – The mobile application name, mobile application id, app store, developer of the application, star ratings of the application, age rating of the application and other publicly available information about the mobile application where the advertisement is delivered to.
This information is used to ensure the advertisements are delivered in the right context our Customer has set in the profile settings in our system.
==========
Digital environment attributes – The type of connected device the advertisement is being delivered to: mobile, desktop, connected TV or other device, the browser type and version used to render the page where the ad appears and the operating system are collected to determine what version of our code would properly run in that environment and to properly measure if the advertisement had the chance to become viewable on the screen according to industry standards which vary between environments.
Viewability attributes – The location of the ad on the page, the size of the ad, the size of the screen, the size of the viewport, the tab focus status, the browser focus status, the time duration the ad was in the viewable part of the webpage and the scroll position of the webpage are collected to determine and report to our Customers if the advertisement had the chance to become viewable on the screen.
Exposure and engagement attributes – Data that shows if the ad was clicked, swiped, tapped or touched, resized, skipped, muted, paused, rotated, hovered or changed volume is collected to help our Customers measure the performance of the advertisement, the advertising campaign or the media property.
2.
Categories of data collected and used to power Fraud Elimination:
Pseudonymous electronic presence and device identifiers – i.e. IP address, user agent string or derivatives of the combination of these two values – are used in order to assess whether the online presence or device is participating in or associated with a fraudulent scheme.
3.
==========
Categories of data collected and used to power Geo Verification:
Pseudonymous electronic presence and device identifiers – IP address – are collected to determine the geographical location they are associated with.
Each IP is associated with a country, and, within the United States, may be associated with more specific information down to zip code.
==========
Your exact geolocation information is never collected.
The Solutions are not intended to or directed at the processing of children’s Personal Information.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child’s Personal Information may have been processed through the Solutions, please contact us by using the information in Section 13 “How to Contact DoubleVerify” below and we will take steps to securely delete their Personal Information from our systems.
4.
==========
HOW DO WE USE DATA WE COLLECT?
DoubleVerify only uses the Technical Information and Personal Information collected for the purposes outlined in Section 3, “What Data do we Collect and for What Purposes?”
, of this Solutions Privacy Notice.
==========
In general, the Technical Information and your Personal Information are processed to provide reporting, dashboards, feedback and insights (“Reporting”) to our Customers.
Any Reporting, in any format, is anonymized and aggregated, or, to the extent impression level information is required, each impression is de-identified to ensure your Personal Information is never shared with Customers.
==========
This Section provides additional insight into how the Technical Information and your Personal Information is processed to achieve the business purposes specified in Section 3 of this Solutions Privacy Notice.
DoubleVerify uses the Technical Information collected through the Solutions, as specified in Section 3.1, in the following ways:
To analyze and report on the context in which advertisements are displayed, their quality, authenticity and performance.
Specifically, information illustrating whether an ad being displayed is in compliance with a Customer’s pre-set legal and placement requirements, as well as preference settings the Customer has established in our system.
==========
To provide insights and preemptive decisioning of impression opportunities.
DoubleVerify technology analyzes the data characteristics of an impression opportunity and determines whether the Customer’s advertisement should be displayed or not, for example by determining that the surrounding content does not align with that Customer’s branding and preferences.
==========
DoubleVerify, to power Fraud Elimination, uses the Technical Information and Personal Information collected through the Solutions, as specified in Section 3.1 and 3.2, to:
To review and identify specific ad impressions that are fraudulent due to being generated by bot-controlled, non-human browsers.
To assess and identify invalid traffic such as traffic generated by ad injectors, traffic originated in data centers, misrepresented traffic, emulated traffic and other types of invalid traffic.
To analyze and identify websites, mobile and connected device apps, and media properties that have fraudulent traffic and/or generate fraudulent advertising impressions.
To identify traffic patterns across websites participating in fraudulent advertising activity.
To differentiate between traffic generated by bot-controlled, non-human browsers and human browsers.
==========
To determine whether ads analyzed follow applicable legal requirements and preferences set by our Customers.
Determine if a middleware is attempting to misrepresent its operating characteristics to prevent the identification of fraud or other invalid traffic.
Determine if website traffic or ad impressions are originating from a server farm rather than human-generated browsing activity.
Determine if traffic is being acquired through fraudulent practices or through other traffic acquisition practices that are not compliant with a Customer’s guidelines or preferences.
==========
To create records of IP addresses and user agent strings associated with fraudulent schemes and non-human generated traffic (“Fraud Tables”).
Because such data points are associated with non-human interactions, they do not constitute Personal Information.
DoubleVerify, to power Geo Verification, uses the Technical Information and Personal Information collected through the Solutions, as specified in Section 3.3, to:
Assess at high level (country, state, region, or, for US residents, zip code) the geographic location of the End User and verify if the End User is located within the Customer’s campaign or traffic settings.

To verify your identity or understand the scope of your request we may need to request additional information about you.
You will not be required to create an account with us to submit a request or have it fulfilled.
You will need to provide an email address so we can communicate with you and support your request, as well as any information we may need to allow us to verify whether we hold any Personal Information about you.
Please be aware that circumstances may exist that will render us unable to fulfill your request, but if we are unable to fulfill your request we will explain why.
