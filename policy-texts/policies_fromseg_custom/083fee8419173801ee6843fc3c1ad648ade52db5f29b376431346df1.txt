Personal Data
Personal data means any information that can be used to collect personal or factual information about you (such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth or e-mail address).
Information that is not referred to you personally (or only with disproportionate efforts), for example pseudonymous or anonymous information, is not personal data.

Personal Information which will be Collected and Used
In principle, you can use our online services without providing personal information.
However, if you decide to request further information, we will ask for your name and other personal information.
It is your decision whether you give us this information or not.
==========
However, without this information we can not offer you the desired services.
According to the retrieval of desired information, data is stored on our servers in order to provide a service or for security purposes, which may allow identification (for example IP address, date, time and pages viewed).
This information will be deleted, when no longer needed.

How we use your information
There is no personal evaluation.
The statistical analysis of anonymous data records is reserved.
It will be stored, e.g. in case of IP logs, for system security reasons (to prevent abuse), to improve the site and for statistical purposes (number of users and page views).
Personal data are processed for billing and promotional purposes by us or by our partners (e.g. premiums orders).
==========
You will be notified separately for this process.
In addition, a processing and use of your data for other purposes takes place only after your explicit consent.
Without your explicit consent, your data will not be used e.g. for marketing purposes.
You will only receive advertising, if you have given your explicit consent.
You can revoke this consent any time by sending an email to info@ligatus.com .
In this case, if so, the service offered by Ligatus can no longer be offered.
==========
We do not create user profiles.
General information is recorded, such as when each page was viewed at Ligatus or which page was visited most frequently.
6.
==========
Further use of personal data (third parties)
Due to legal requirements, we are sometimes obliged to disclose your personal information to third parties.
This is for example the case when the suspicion of a crime or misuse of our site exists.
We are then obliged to disclose your data to law enforcement authorities.
==========
Otherwise, your information is stored in our database and on our servers or on those of our data processors, unless you were advised that the information would be given to other companies, like our cooperation or promotional partners, and you explicit agreed to a transfer of your data.
You can recognize the websites that we maintain with our cooperation or promotional partners e.g. from the joint trademark of Ligatus and the cooperation or promotional partner on the website you click.
Sometimes you may enter personal information on sites which, although framed in Ligatus Look and Feel, have a content from a third party ("frame-to-frame").
In this case, you can directly provide your personal data to third parties without Ligatus influence or process of your personal data.
==========
In addition, on our website there are hyperlinks to other websites.
In these cases, you are redirected from our website directly to the website of another provider.
That happens when the URL changes.
==========
If you have been forwarded by a so-called hyperlink to the website of a cooperation or promoting partner, the use of your data will be only subjected to the privacy policy of this company.
We can not take over any responsibility for the privacy practices of third party´s websites, because we do have no control over their compliance with data protection regulations.

==========
Protection of minors
Persons under 18 years old should not give us any personal information without the consent of their parents or guardians.
We do not demand personal information from children and adolescents.
We consciously do not collect such information and do not disclose it to third parties.

==========
How we keep your information secure
When we collect information, we or our data processor keep your data on specially protected servers in Germany.
Access is restricted to authorized persons who are involved in the technical, commercial or editorial support.
In order to avoid loss or misuse of data stored by us we take all the necessary technical and operational safety precautions, which are regularly checked and updated.
However, we would like to inform you that because of the constitution of the internet, the rules of data protection and the security measures mentioned above may not be observed by others, persons or institutions beyond our control.
Especially unencrypted data – even sent via e-mail – can be read by third parties.
