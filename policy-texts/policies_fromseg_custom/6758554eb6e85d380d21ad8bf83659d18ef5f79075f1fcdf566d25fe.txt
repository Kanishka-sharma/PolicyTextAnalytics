►United States - English
Your privacy is important to Box.
This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to the Box Web sites and services and tells you how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, and protected by Box.
If you use the Box site and services as part of an entity or organization that has Enterprise service with Box (like your employer or a university), the individual terms of that organization’s contract for Enterprise service may restrict our collection or use of your personal information more than what is described in this Policy.
This statement includes Box’s European Union and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Statements and the Website Privacy Statements.
==========
Changes to This Policy
We may change this Policy from time to time.
If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “last updated” date above.
If there are material changes to this Policy, we will notify you more directly.
==========
We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you use our Web sites and services to understand how your personal information is used.
Information Collected
We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Web sites and services.
==========
We may also supplement this information with information from other companies.
We collect two general types of information, namely personal information and aggregate data.
As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and email address), and demographic and other information when directly linked to information that can identify an individual.
==========
Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” data.
Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed.
In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data.
Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services.
This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customer needs and improve our services and for advertising and marketing purposes.
==========
The following are the specific types of information we collect from you.
Information You Give Us.
We collect information you give us on our Web site and when you register for and use our services.
Examples include the following:
Registration and Profile Information.
When you register to use our services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you including, your name and email address; your title, company and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information you upload like photos, files, and documents.
==========
Contact Information.
We collect the email addresses you provide for contacts you enter or upload into your private contacts page.
When you choose to collaborate or share files with others, we also collect email addresses you provide to email invitations to those individuals on your behalf.
==========
Payment Information.
If you choose to use a paid Box account or service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card information and billing address.
Submissions and Customer Service.
==========
From time to time we may use surveys, contests or sweepstakes requesting personal or demographic information and customer feedback.
Automatically Collected Information.
We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, services and communications.
For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit, including ours.
That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses.
We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you.
Cookies and Web Beacons.
We may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies and Web beacons to collect information.
Among other things, the use of cookies and Web beacons enables us to improve our Web sites and emails by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our Web site, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Web site without re-entering your member ID and/or password.
A cookie is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser from a Web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting.
You can modify your browser setting to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie by editing your browser options.
However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Web site and services may not function properly.
For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain Web page features or services.
A Web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be used on our Web pages to deliver cookies, count visits and compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
Use of Personal Information.
==========
In general, we use your personal information to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Web site and services and to otherwise serve you and our users.
For example, we may use your personal information:
to request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Web site and our publications, products and services;
to conduct marketing analysis, to send you surveys or newsletters, to contact you about services, products, activities, special events or offers from Box or our partners and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes;

==========
If you are an individual Box registered user, and the domain of the primary email address associated with your Box account is owned by your employer and that email address was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and that organization wishes to establishes a Box corporate account and add you to it, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator including your email address.
Box includes collaboration features that by their nature support sharing with users you choose.
==========
Those users can see your name, email address, photo and information from your Profile page, and any files you choose to share; and they can post comments and email you.
Collaborators you invite as editors can also edit your shared files, upload documents and photos to your shared files, share those documents outside of Box, and give other users rights to view your shared files.
==========
Box provides you with opportunities to connect with third party applications or services, such as through our Open Box page or Box application partner ecosystem.
If you choose to use any such third party applications or services, we may facilitate sharing of your information including your Box username and documents you choose to use with those applications and services and such third parties may contact you directly as necessary.

==========
The servers on which information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access.
