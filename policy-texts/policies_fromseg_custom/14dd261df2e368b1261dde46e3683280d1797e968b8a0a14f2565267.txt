==========
Disclaimer of Warranties
YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.
==========
REDTUBE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
IN PARTICULAR, AND WITHOUT LIMITATION, REDTUBE MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT: (1) THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (2) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; (3) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE; (4) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS; (5) ANY ERRORS IN THE COMPONENTS OR CONTENTS OF THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED; OR (6) OR THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
No advice or information, oral or written, obtained by you from RedTube, shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these TOS.
==========
Limitation of Liability 
YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT REDTUBE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF REDTUBE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE.
IN PARTICULAR, AND WITHOUT LIMITATION, REDTUBE WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM: (1) ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINING ANY CONTENT OR COMPONENT OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF IT RESULTS IN THE INADVERTENT TRANSFER OF HARMFUL COMPUTER CODE, SUCH AS VIRUSES, MALWARE, OR SPYWARE; (2) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR DISCLOSURE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR POSTINGS, TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (3) CONTENT OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE; OR (4) AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE TOS.
==========
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL RETUBE'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO REDTUBE OR $100.
Exclusions and Limitations 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND DAMAGES MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDE FOR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES ALLOCATE RISKS BETWEEN YOU AND REDTUBE.
THAT ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE DELIVERY OF FREE CONTENT TO YOU BY REDTUBE, AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
Indemnification 
You agree to hold harmless and indemnify RedTube, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from and against any third-party claim arising from or in any way related to your use of the Service, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature.
==========
RedTube will make reasonable efforts to provide you with written notice of any such claim, suit or action, but the failure of RedTube to provide such notice will not relieve you of these obligations.
Severability 
If any provision of these TOS is found invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of the TOS will remain in force.
Non-Waiver 
The failure of RedTube to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.
Choice of Law 
The agreement created by these TOS, and any dispute arising from or relating to these TOS or the provision or use of the Service, will be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without giving effect to conflict of laws provisions.
==========
Arbitration & Class Action Waiver
You and RedTube agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.
You and RedTube hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any dispute we have that is subject to this arbitration agreement.
Neither you nor RedTube may bring a claim against the other as a class action.
Neither you nor RedTube may act as a private attorney general or class representative, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any dispute or claim between us.
==========
As used in this arbitration agreement and waiver, the terms "RedTube" and "you" include RedTube's and your respective owners, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, predecessors in interest, successors, attorneys, and assigns.
This arbitration agreement and waiver will be interpreted broadly, and will encompass all disputes between you and RedTube, including, but not limited to claims that relate in any way to the relationship between you and RedTube, your use of the Service, and any advertising or content of the Service, regardless of legal or equitable theory.
==========
This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.
Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief from us on your behalf.
==========
Moreover, you and RedTube have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
Arbitration of any dispute or claim must be initiated within two years, or within the period of time provided by applicable statute, after the date on which the basis for the dispute or claim first arises.
The arbitration will be conducted by the JAMS dispute resolution service.
==========
To initiate arbitration, you or RedTube must submit a claim to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, California, USA, 94111, tel. 415-982-5267, with notice to the other party by certified mail.
Notice to RedTube should be sent to: For more information regarding JAMS, you may visit its website at http://www.jamsadr.com/.
==========
These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 et seq. ("FAA").
In addition, the arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules") in effect on the date of commencement of the arbitration, as modified by these TOS.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator.
The arbitration will be based entirely on the written submissions of the parties and documents submitted to the arbitrator, unless the parties agree or the arbitrator orders otherwise.
==========
Unless you and RedTube both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join your claim(s) or RedTube's claim(s) with any other claim, and may not preside over any representative or class proceedings.
For any arbitration in which you claim less than $10,000, RedTube will reimburse you for the cost of your filing fee with AAA or JAMS and will directly pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees.
For claims between $10,000 and $75,000, you will pay any filing fee required by JAMS, and RedTube will pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees.
If you bring claims between $10,000 and $75,000 and cannot afford to pay the filing fee, RedTube will pay the fee directly on your behalf upon written notice from you.
If, however, the arbitrator determines that any claim brought by you is frivolous, then payment of JAMS' costs and fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.
Furthermore, if the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous, you agree to reimburse RedTube for any costs or fees that it paid that otherwise would have been your responsibility under the JAMS Rules.
If you bring a claim for greater than $75,000 payment of fees and other costs to JAMS will be governed by the JAMS rules.
In issuing any award, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that is sufficiently detailed to inform both you and RedTube of the reasons for his or her decision.
==========
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only as necessary to provide the relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
Any award may be confirmed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
All post-award proceedings will be governed by the FAA.
Entire Agreement 
These TOS, together with the RedTube Privacy Policy and the RedTube DMCA Page, constitute the entire agreement between you and RedTube and governs your use of the Site.
==========
You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other services, such as affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.
In order to determine what those obligations may be, you understand and agree that it is your responsibility to review any and all terms and conditions of usage and privacy policies with respect to such service, content, or software.

Information Collected by this Service
When you use the Service, we may collect passive information about your visit.
==========
Passive information is any form of aggregate data, navigational data, tracking data, click-stream data, or historical data.
It may include the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., whether you logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the RedTube website) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform).
==========
We use this information to track how users are accessing and using the Service.
In addition, when you use the Service we generally collect the IP Address of the computer you are using to access it.
(An IP, or "Internet Protocol," address is a unique number associated with your computer, that may be communicated to other computers and servers when you use the Internet.)
We use this information for purposes of security and anti-fraud protection.
==========
RedTube also uses cookies and/or web beacons.
(A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive, and that may be accessed when you use a website or other online service.
A web beacon is a small, transparent graphic image placed on a website, which allows the site to record the actions of a visitor opening the page that contains the beacon.)
We may use cookies or web beacons to: (1) determine whether users of the Service are unique, or whether the same user is using the Service on multiple occasions; (2) help deliver advertisements; (3) track usage throughout various components of the RedTube website and the Service (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Service, etc.); (4) store your agreement to the terms and conditions for entering and using the Service; (5) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.
==========
These kinds of information do not, on their own, personally identify you.
However, they can potentially be combined with information obtained from other sources in order to identify you.
==========
RedTube does not ordinarily seek or obtain personally identifying information about users from others.
It does reserve the right to seek such information in the event of a violation of the RedTube Terms of Service, in the event of a dispute between RedTube and you, or if required by law to do so.
Content You Submit RedTube to or Communicate Using the Service
RedTube may allow you to submit and communicate audio and video content, text, links, and other content ("User Content").
Except with respect to User Content that you are expressly allowed and enabled to keep private using the RedTube Community uploading function, User Content that you submit to RedTube or communicate using the Service, including any personal information included in your User Content, becomes publicly available and can be seen, collected, and used by others.
==========
Once made public User Content cannot be made private again.
In addition, User Content you communicate using the Service may be recorded, stored, copied and/or retransmitted by RedTube, including but not limited to audio or video content submitted to the RedTube Community, RedTube Blog and  calls made to RedTube Radio.
You should not submit or communicate any content using the Service that you do not want to be seen, collected, or used by others.
==========
In the process of posting User Content, you may be asked to provide some personally identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, a password, and other documentation.
You may also be asked to provide such information in order to use certain features of the Service, including but not limited certain features of the RedTube blog available only to registered users.
We will keep a record of the information you provide, including your personally identifiable information.
That information may be linked in our records to other information you provide, including User Content.
We will not publically post your name or other personally identifying information, and we will not provide such information to our advertisers or business partners without your permission.
However,  some of the information you provide in registering for and using the RedTube Community feature will be displayed to other members of the RedTube Community, and may become public.
In addition, we may disclose the personally identifying information and documentation you provide in some limited circumstances, as set forth below ("Permitted Disclosures of Personal Information").
Use of Visitor Information Collected by the Service
We do not share personally identifiable information about users of the Service in the ordinary operation of the Service, unless you have included such information in User Content that you submit or communicate using the Service, such as through the RedTube Community feature.
We may obtain and merge information about users and usage of the Service into aggregated data, which may then be used by us and/or shared with advertisers or others.
When we provide aggregated information to outside companies, they will not be able to identify you or contact you based on that data.
Usage Information - Collection and Use by Advertisers and Others
RedTube allows other companies to display advertisements using the Service.
These companies use technology to deliver advertisements you see using the Service directly to your browser.
In doing so, they may automatically receive your IP address.
Other companies that place advertising using the Service may have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about your usage of the Service.
We do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect information.
However, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines.
Therefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or content may be provided through the Service generally will not know who you are unless you provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by some other means.
==========
Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly allow children to use the Service, and all users of the Service must confirm that they are at least 21 years old.
We do not collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under 21, and no part of our Service is designed to attract anyone under 21.
If we become aware that anyone under the age of 21 is using the Service, their access to the Service will be terminated.
==========

However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure.

DMCA Notice Of Copyright Infringement
Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement
We take claims of copyright infringement seriously.
We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) and/or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws.
==========
Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating the user’s access to www.RedTube.com (the “RedTube”).
If you believe any material accessible on RedTube infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, “Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement” for instructions on filing such a notice).
These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.
If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, “Counter-Notification Procedures” for instructions on filing a counter notification).
==========
It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement
*The fastest and easiest way to notify RedTube of alleged copyright infringement is via our form found at http://copyrightcomplianceagency.com/submit/index?id=RedTube.com.
==========
This form is designed to help you identify your content accurately and help speed up the process of content take-down.
*
If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process.
==========
Do not make false claims.
Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.
==========
We will also accept free-form copyright infringement notifications, submitted by email, fax and mail.
In that case, in accordance with the DMCA, the written notice (the “DMCA Notice”) must include substantially the following:

Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works, a representative list of such works.
==========
Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material.
If your complaint does not contain the specific URL of the video you believe infringes your rights, we may be unable to locate and remove it.
==========
General information about the video, such as a channel URL or username, typically is not adequate.
Please include the URL(s) of the exact video(s).
Adequate information by which we, and the uploader(s) of any video(s) you remove, can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).
==========
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.
A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf.
To satisfy this requirement, you may type your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.
==========
Our designated Copyright Agent to receive DMCA Notices is:
If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.
Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on RedTube is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys” fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.
Counter-Notification Procedures
If you have received a DMCA Notice and believe that material you posted on RedTube was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (a “Counter-Notice”).
Counter notifications must be submitted by the video’s original uploader or an agent authorized to act on their behalf.
Counter-notices must be sent to our designated agent:
Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:

Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature;
Identification of the allegedly infringing content and its location before removal or access to it was disabled;
A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification; and
A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial district in which the operator of RedTube may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided us with the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.
We will not respond to counter notifications that do not meet the requirements above.
After we receive your Counter Notice, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original DMCA Notice and inform that party that the removed material may be restored after 10 business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we received your Counter Notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party who filed the original DMCA Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.
==========
Please note that when we forward your Counter Notice, it will include your personal information.
By submitting a counter notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way.
We will not forward the counter notification to any party other than the original claimant or to law enforcement or parties that assist us with enforcing and protecting our rights.
==========
Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on RedTube was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.
Repeat Infringers
In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating and/or disabling, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.
We may also at our sole discretion limit access to RedTube, terminate and/or disable the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
