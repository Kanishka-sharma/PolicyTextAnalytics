Criteo Retargeting Solution Privacy Policy
Who is Criteo?
Criteo is a specialist in creating personalized advertisements.
We work with retailers to build advertisements for their customers.
Our aim is to deliver more relevant advertisements, by displaying products that you might be interested in based on your recent visit to a particular retailer's site.
==========
Criteo exhibits these products within personalized banners that you may see while visiting websites that display advertising.
What is the advantage of receiving ads built by Criteo?
You should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Criteo.
Our hope is that over time you will receive fewer annoying ads that aren't relevant to you and which interrupt your online activities.
==========
What does Criteo know about me through the ads they serve?
We do not know who you are.
We do not know your name.
==========
We do not know where you live, where you work, your gender, your age, your email address or any other personally identifiable information about you.
We do not collect any information from the publisher website on which you may have seen our ads.
We do not store your IP address.
==========
We do know that the Internet Browser you are using has visited one of our partner sites (probably an online retailer) in the last 30 days, and we have seen which products you were interested in on that site.
What information does Criteo collect about me through their technology and how do they use that information?
We only collect anonymous data.
In order to identify which products you might be interested in, Criteo records, via anonymous cookies, which pages you have browsed on our partners' website - normally an online retailer.
Cookies keep the information of which pages you viewed, and in certain cases which products you bought.
This data is anonymous and exclusively meant for statistical treatment.
There is absolutely no way for Criteo to identify the visitor.
==========
Our advertisements do not combine information about you from multiple sources.
We do not take any user information from a retailer that they may have stored about you (name, address, etc).
We do not share any data with any site that displays our advertising.
Where will I see advertisements powered by Criteo?
Our retailers' advertisements are displayed on many Internet sites ("Publishers").
==========
In some cases, these Publishers may also place a cookie on your browser.
This cookie is there so that the Publisher recognizes that Criteo has a personalized advertisement available for your browser.
For example Google, as a third party vendor, uses a cookie (which they call a DART cookie) to identify users where Criteo has a personalized advertisement.
==========
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google advertising privacy policies.
To opt out of all Criteo personalized banners see below.
