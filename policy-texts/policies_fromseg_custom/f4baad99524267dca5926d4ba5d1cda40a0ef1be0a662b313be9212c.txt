About Our Advertising Services
RadiumOne provides online display, mobile, video, and social advertising services.
In order to provide our services, we buy advertising space from hundreds of websites and mobile applications around the world and resell it in targeted packages to advertisers and agencies (“Targeted Advertising”).
Targeted Advertising is displayed (a) on the browsers of devices such as computers, laptops, tablets or smartphones or (b) inside mobile applications.
Users benefit from Targeted Advertising by receiving advertisements (“ads”) which are more interesting and relevant than untargeted ads, while advertisers benefit through the more efficient delivery of ads to interested Users.
==========
Targeted Advertising is based on data that does not personally identify you and is collected from your devices as described below in “What Information We Collect”.
Data used in Targeted Advertising may range from your (i) interests, (ii) similarities to other Users, (iii) general demographic information, and (iv) general geographic location.
This non-personally identifiable information may be used to classify Users who are most likely to respond to an ad.
We do not intentionally collect information that identifies you (such as your name, address, phone number, or email address), and we prohibit our partners from sharing this information with us.
==========
What Information We Collect
The information we collect falls into two categories – Browser-Based Data and Mobile App-Based Data.
For information about opting out from the collection of Browser-Based Data and Mobile App-Based Data, please visit our Opt Out page by clicking here.
