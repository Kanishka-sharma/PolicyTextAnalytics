Adobe Systems Incorporated may receive personal information from Adobe subsidiaries (see list of Adobe entities and our acquired companies), our corporate customers, and other business partners in the EEA and Switzerland, such as name, email address, company name, title, postal address, telephone number, and preferences regarding our applications and websites.
Any personal information sent to us may be used by Adobe Systems Incorporated and its subsidiaries and their agents and business partners for the purposes described at the time the information was collected.
If you agree to receive email or telephone marketing from us, personal information we receive will also be used for those purposes, as described in the Adobe Privacy Policy.

Agents and service providers

These companies provide services such as offering customer support, processing credit card payments, and sending emails on our behalf.
In some cases, these companies will have access to some of your personal information in order to provide services to you on our behalf.
They are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes.
Adobe Systems Incorporated requires that its agents and service providers that have access to personal information received by Adobe Systems Incorporated from the EU or Switzerland subscribe to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, be subject to the EU Privacy Directive or another adequacy finding, or enter into a written agreement that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles.
