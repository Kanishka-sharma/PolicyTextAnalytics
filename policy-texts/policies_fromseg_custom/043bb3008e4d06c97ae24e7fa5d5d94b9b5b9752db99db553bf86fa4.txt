When you visit our Services, we may also automatically collect certain information for system administration including, where available, your IP address, your operating system and browser type and navigation data.
Please see our cookies policy in the “Cookies” section below of this Privacy Policy for further information about what information will be automatically collected when you visit our Services.
In some cases, we receive personal data from third parties.
For instance, while using the Services, individuals may provide information about another individual, or an authorized user (such as an account administrator) creating an account on your behalf may provide information about you.
==========
We retain personal data for as long as we reasonably need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
For example, if you create an account with us, we will store the personal data associated with your account for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the Services you requested, enforce any applicable terms that govern your use of the Services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our delivery of the Services to you.
==========
Privacy Settings / Opt Out

            If we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
If you wish to modify any of your user profile information, withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data, or cancel your account, you may update the settings in your user profile or contact us at privacy@sketchfab.com.
==========
Children Privacy Rules

            Our Services are not intended for persons under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children under the age of 16.
If you have reason to believe that a person under the age of 16 has provided personal data to us, please contact us at privacy@sketchfab.com, and we will make every effort to answer your queries and immediately delete that information from our databases.
Digital Will

            Where the French Data Protection Act is applicable, you have the right to make arrangements for the storage and communication of your personal data after your death.
To exercise this right, you can send us your instructions at privacy@sketchfab.com.
==========
Recipients of Your Personal Data

            We may share your personal data with the other entities within the Sketchfab group, but only for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.
We may otherwise disclose your personal data:
        


                to business partners, suppliers, and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you, for example for hosting and operating the Services or providing support and maintenance services for the Services;
            

                to analytics and search engine providers and other selected third parties that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our website;
            

                to our regulators, law enforcement, or fraud prevention agencies, as well as our advisors (including legal advisors and auditors), courts, and any other authorized bodies, for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity or other regulatory or legal matters;
            

                in the event of a merger, acquisition, or other similar event, to a prospective buyer or otherwise of our business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to such prospective buyer or otherwise of such business or assets;
            

                if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Sketchfab, our customers, or others.
This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;
            

                to legal advisors and otherwise in connection with legal proceedings in order to enforce or apply our rights under any contract; and
            

                otherwise where we have notified you of the intended disclosure, and where required, you have expressly given your prior consent to such disclosure.
==========
You may provide information or content to be published or displayed on public areas of the Services, or transmitted to other users of the Services or third parties.
Although you may set certain privacy settings for such information by logging into your account profile, anyone may view such information or content that you choose to submit or post in this manner.
==========
Transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area

            We operate and support the Services from different locations around the world (including the United States), which may have different data protection rules to those where you are located.
Regardless of where your personal data is stored or processed, we will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If we transfer your personal data collected in the European Union to locations outside of the European Economic Area (for example, the United States), we do so pursuant to transfer mechanisms, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”), adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards for your personal data.
The current version of the SCCs can be found at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=EN.
==========
Please contact us using the information in the Contact Us section below if you would like more information regarding the transfer mechanisms we use for such transfers, or if you would like us to provide you with a copy of them.
Privacy Shield Framework

            In accordance with the Court of Justice of the European Union’s (CJEU) invalidation of the Privacy Shield Framework as a valid transfer mechanism, Sketchfab no longer relies on the EU–US Privacy Shield Framework as a legal mechanism for transfers of personal data of its EU based users to the US.
However, to demonstrate our commitment to privacy, we maintain our adherence to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability.
==========
Sketchfab remains subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern, but this does not limit any more protective rights you may have under applicable laws.
In the context of an onward transfer, Sketchfab has responsibility for the processing of personal data we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
Sketchfab shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if this agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the alleged damage.
In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles in each of the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
