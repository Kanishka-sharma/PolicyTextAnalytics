We may collect and transmit such device information as either raw or hashed data, depending on the sensitivity of the information in question.

Consumers.
AppLovin primarily collects information from Consumers when an application developer or website publisher requests AppLovin to serve an advertisement to a consumer.

AppLovin may track this information over time and across multiple AppLovin Apps (and may also combine the device information with anonymous information from other sources) in order to deliver advertisements through the Services.
In addition, AppLovin may collect information from Consumers through use of a Cookie, Web Beacon or similar tracking technologies if the Consumer accesses advertisements from a browser or is redirected to a browser by advertisements provided through the Services.
Certain advertisements may redirect you to a browser where AppLovin may use a Cookie to track Consumer activities.

==========
Sharing Your Information With Other Companies

We may disclose your personal information to third parties when you consent to a particular disclosure of your personal information.
Please note that once we share your information with another company, that information becomes subject to the other company’s privacy practices.
==========
Compelled Disclosures:
On rare occasions, we may share your personal information when compelled to do so by government authorities or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations (e.g., pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or court orders).
AppLovin may also share your personal information with third parties if we believe in good faith that disclosure is appropriate to protect our rights, property or safety (including the enforcement of the AppLovin Terms of Use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of third parties.

8.
==========
Children’s Privacy
We do not use the Services to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of thirteen (13).
We request that such individuals do not provide personal information through the Services.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should promptly contact us and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.
9.
==========
Data Security, Integrity and Retention
Your privacy is very important to AppLovin and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards.
For example, we use firewalls, encryption technology and other automated software designed to protect against fraud and identity theft.
==========
In addition, we take steps to ensure that information is stored in an anonymous format through a technique known as “hashing”.
When a Consumer downloads and uses an App or website that requests AppLovin to serve advertisements, we may collect and process information locally on the Consumer’s mobile device.
==========
This allows us to identify the sensitivity level of certain device information prior to transferring it to our servers for storage.
Rather than sending sensitive device information as raw data that can be easily associated with the relevant Consumer, we only transfers anonymous hashed representations of certain types of information back to AppLovin.
Our servers then associate the hashed representations with a unique anonymous identifier assigned to each Consumer by AppLovin.
When a Consumer subsequently interacts with the Services, this process allows us targeted advertising without storing any sensitive information in a form that would be easily readable to unauthorized third parties.
AppLovin also protects Consumer privacy by seeking to minimize the amount of sensitive data that we store on our servers in the first place.
For additional information regarding how we store data, please refer to the Consumer Privacy portion of the Site.
==========
You may also contact us anytime with your questions or concerns.
AppLovin retains the raw data it collects from Consumers for up to 2 years.
==========
The information received from Business Partners is retained for as long as needed to provide you services.
We will retain and use the information we receive for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
10.
==========

The most recent version of the Policy will always be posted on the Site.

If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
==========
