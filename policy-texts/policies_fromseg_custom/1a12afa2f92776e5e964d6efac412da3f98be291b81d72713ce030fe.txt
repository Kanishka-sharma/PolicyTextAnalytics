The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media network.
==========
Data Obtained by Automated Means
We also obtain certain data by automated means, though the use of cookies (including HTTP and HTML5 local storage), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your usage of various Company affiliate sites and mobile applications, and other offerings and services, and those of our business partners.
A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a user’s computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the user’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
==========
The data the Company obtains and receives from users of its affiliates’ sites and applications and of its third party business partners through these automated collection methods may include:
IP address
Mobile device advertising ID
Browser characteristics
Device characteristics
Operating system
Language preferences
Referring URLs
Information on actions taken on Company affiliate and business partner sites
Dates and times users access or use Company affiliate and business partner sites
Cookies set on Company affiliate and business partner sites for syncing purposes as described below.
We may link this data, such as browser or device information, with other data obtained by automated means, including what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on Company affiliate or business partner sites.
==========
You can learn more and control Flash Cookies by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Panel and Global Storage Settings Panel.
Please note, however, that without cookies some or all of the features of the Company affiliate or business partner services may not be available to you.
User device settings also may limit mobile application platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain data obtained by automated means with us through our Company affiliate and/or third party business partner mobile applications.
==========
News IQ ID & ID Syncing
NCAE associates data it collects about a browser or device with a randomly generated, pseudonymous identifier known as the “NCG ID”.
To the extent permitted by your browser settings, NCAE syncs the NCG ID with identifiers and the data obtained from cookies placed on the participating Company affiliate and/or business partner sites you or the specific browser or device have visited to serve you advertisements on our Company affiliate and/or business partner sites and apps tailored to your interests, as further described in the Interest-Based Advertising Section below.
ID syncing, also known as cookie syncing or cookie matching, is a common industry practice that enables businesses to use data to coordinate an advertising campaign across multiple publishing platforms and advertising service providers.
==========
As an example, an individual uses a web browser to visit a publisher’s website and then leaves the website.
The publisher wants to advertise relevant services to that visitor after he/she leaves the website.
To do so, the publisher stores a cookie on the visitor’s browser with an ID (such as “123”) and associates the ID with information about what the visitor viewed on the publisher’s website, and buys advertising through an online advertising exchange or marketplace.
In order to buy appropriate advertising to display to that visitor, the publisher would need to match the “123” ID with the ID that the exchange has assigned to the same visitor (for example, exchange ID “XYZ”).
Using ID syncing, the publisher “123” ID is associated with the same browser or device as the exchange ID “XYZ”.
In addition, the publisher may be able to show more relevant advertisements to the visitor based on the initial information the publisher collected from that visitor when the visitor was on the publisher’s site.
==========
For example, the syncing allows the publisher to match the data collected from the visitor while on the publisher’s site with other sources of data also associated with the visitor.
This syncing can be done across multiple sites.
==========
Personal Data about Users of NCAE’s Sales/Promotional Site
NCAE also maintains a sales/promotional site, where potential advertisers, third party partners and other users may learn about NCAE’s offerings and services.
When a user visits such site, we may collect such visitor’s contact information (name, email address and phone number), company name and title of position within the visitor’s company, all to the extent such Personal Data is provided to us.
Data collected from a visitor of NCAE’s sales/promotional site is not comingled with any other data that NCAE may otherwise have obtained regarding that visitor through the advertising exchange services described above.
==========
The Purposes & Legal Bases for Which We Use the Data We Obtain
