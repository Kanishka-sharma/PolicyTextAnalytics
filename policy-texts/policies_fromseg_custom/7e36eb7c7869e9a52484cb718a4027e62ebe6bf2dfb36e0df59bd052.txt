==========
College Confidential will attempt to notify Website users whenever it modifies or revises the Terms of Service, Forum Rules and/or Privacy Policy, however, we reserve the right to make such modifications or revisions without prior notice to you.
College Confidential recommends that Website users review the most up-to-date version of the Terms of Service, Forum Rules and Privacy Policy periodically at www.collegeconfidential.com.
Moderation  College Confidential moderators and administrators may edit, move, and delete posts to make them more accessible or to bring them into compliance with our Terms of Services and Forum Rules.
If an edit changes the context or meaning of the post in any significant way, moderators will usually include a note that the post has been edited in the post itself.
All moderation, however, is performed on a "best efforts" basis - each poster is fully responsible for his/her own posts, and each visitor is responsible for what he/she reads.
Offensive posts should be reported to the moderators, and every effort will be made to remove them as soon as possible.
==========
Out of respect for both moderators and policies, discussion of moderator actions and forum policies is welcomed via private message or e-mail; these issues are off-topic for the forums.
College Confidential reserves the right at all times to disclose any information posted on the forums, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that in College Confidential's sole and absolute discretion are objectionable.
You acknowledge that College Confidential reserves the right to monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Website, including the forums, which information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

==========
Arbitration  All parties to these Terms of Service waive their respective rights to a trial by jury.
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Website shall be binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association.
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against College Confidential in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding against the College Confidential.
(a) By using the Website, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.
In doing so, you give up your right to go to court to assert or defend any claims between you and College Confidential or its affiliates (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court).
You also give up your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding.
==========
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
==========
(b) Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against College Confidential (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Orange County, California.
You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
