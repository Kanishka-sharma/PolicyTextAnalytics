Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads
There are several options available for managing your cookie preferences, depending on the cookie type and your device.
Each of the options are described below.
Please note that no one option is sufficient to manage all cookies on all devices.
Therefore, you may wish to combine one or more options for complete coverage.
==========
Browser Settings
You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies.
You can withdraw or modify your consent to our use of cookies at any time, with the exception of strictly necessary cookies (as described above).
To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings).
==========
Consent Management Platform
In addition, Spotify participates in the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework and complies with its specifications and policies.
We use a consent management platform ("CMP") with the identification number 28.
You may view the CMP and access your cookie settings at CMP.
The CMP allows you to consent to the setting of optional cookies by us and our third-party partners.
Using the CMP, you can manage your preferences in relation to how first party cookies are set according to the category of cookie, as described in Section 2 How do we use cookies?
.
==========
Additionally, third party cookies can be managed according to the purpose for which your data is processed or according to which third-party partners are involved.
The CMP also allows us to maintain records of your consent.
If you wish to update your consent choices via the CMP, please visit CMP.
As set out above, certain third party optional cookie purposes are described as "Always Active", however if you do not wish cookie data to be processed for these purposes then you may toggle off the control next to "store and/or access information" on a device in the CMP CMP.
==========
Please note that as with your web browser settings you will not be able to withdraw consent for cookies which are strictly necessary for the Service to operate.
Mobile Identifiers
On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifier.
This is a unique identifier that can be used to identify a mobile device which works in a similar way to a cookie.
For example, you may use the "Limit Ad Tracking" setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads" (on Android) which allows you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.
==========
Cookies on the Spotify Desktop Application
You can withdraw your consent to our use of cookies on Spotify's desktop application at any time.
If you no longer wish to receive cookies, navigate to your Account Settings page on desktop to find the control under "Advanced" - "Privacy".
When the control is turned on, it will block cookies from that installation of the Spotify desktop application on that computer; if you have Spotify installed on more than one machine, or if you re-install the application, then you will need to turn the feature on for each installation.
==========
You will need to restart the application for this feature to take effect.
Please note that if you set the Spotify desktop application to block cookies, then your Spotify experience may be affected.
==========
Interest-Based Advertising
Certain targeted advertisements that we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) display to you based on information about your online activities across websites and other interactive properties operated by third parties may include the "Ad Choices" icon or another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements.
You may click on the AdChoices icon or visit www.aboutads.info to receive more information about the collection and use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising or to learn how to opt out of having your data used for interest based advertising by Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participating companies.

The Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt-Out Tool at www.networkadvertising.org/choices allows you to opt out from the use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising by NAI member companies.
