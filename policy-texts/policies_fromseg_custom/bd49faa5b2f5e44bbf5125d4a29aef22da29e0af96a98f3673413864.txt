We're really very private.

                    magazine and other associated mental_floss

                    information that you provide to us when using mentalfloss.com.
This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information 
                    received about you when you visit mentalfloss.com.
We may 
                    make content or services from other Web sites including our 
                    affiliated or co-branded Web sites available to you from links 
                    located on mentalfloss.com.
These other Web sites are not 
                    subject to this Privacy Policy.
We recommend that you review 
                    the privacy policy at each such Web site to determine how 
                    that site protects your privacy.
Surveys
 Our reader survey is entirely voluntary and you may 
                    decline to participate by not clicking on the link that says 
                    "survey."
We're not very tricky that way.
The information 
                    is not tied to you personally in any way; we only use it for 
                    demographic purposes.

This information 
                    helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and

Cookies
 We love cookies, particularly chocolate chip.
We don't, 
                    however, use Web cookies on our site.
At least not yet.
Policy Modifications
 We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time on a 
                    whim, for our own amusement.
We have to have fun somehow.
