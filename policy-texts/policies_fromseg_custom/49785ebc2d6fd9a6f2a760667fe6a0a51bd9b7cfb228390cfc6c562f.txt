For User Provided Content, we are merely hosting and providing access, and you agree and acknowledge that we have no liability whatsoever with regard to such material (including with respect to its accuracy).

Users can be held liable for any illegal or prohibited User Provided Content they provide, including among other things, infringing, defamatory or offensive materials.
By submitting material to the Websites, you represent that you have the right to do so, and that you have obtained any third party consents where required (e.g., under data protection or intellectual property laws), and, subject to these Terms and restrictions on data processing in our Privacy Statement, as amended from time to time, you grant Find a Grave and its Group Companies a perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, world-wide license to host, store, copy, publish, distribute, provide access to and otherwise use such material, including, hosting and access on co-branded services of that material, and to use the data contained in that material as search results and to integrate that data into the Service or other services as Find a Grave or the Group Companies deem appropriate.

While we cannot preview or monitor all User Provided Content, we may, at our discretion, apply automated filtering tools, or otherwise monitor and/or delete any content that we believe to be in violation of these Terms (for example, we may use automated tools to suppress obscene content).
We reserve the right, but do not have the obligation, to remove or disable access to any User Provided Content that comes to our attention, including information which we believe, in our sole discretion, is illegal, obscene, indecent, pornographic, illegal or defamatory, incites racial or ethnic hatred, or violates the rights of others, and we may terminate your use of the Service in these circumstances.
You acknowledge and agree that we may preserve any User Provided Content and may disclose any User Provided Content (including its origin) if we believe that it is required to do so by law or that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process or governmental requests; (b) enforce the Terms; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or safety of the Websites, the users of the Websites, or the public.
