==========
End Users of Apps Using Beintoo Services
Beintoo is a mobile data company that focuses on the collection and use of precise location data, to help advertisers provide more relevant offers to mobile application users.
Beintoo receives this location information from a server-to- server transfer and SDK integration with mobile application partners.
This location information generally includes lat.
/long.
==========
data, i.e., GPS-level data, and/or WiFi data (if feasible) associated with a mobile advertising ID, such as an IDFA or an Android Advertising ID (GAID).
We also collect personal data from third-party devices present at certain third-party locations, such as stores, shopping malls, stadiums, bars, restaurants, and other points of interest.
Such devices may use Wi-Fi, near field communication (NFC), or Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacon technology to transmit signals about the location of your Device to us.
We use the data we collect to make inferences about what types of activities users tend to spend time doing.
For instance, we may notice a particular Device frequently at locations associated with car buying (e.g., a dealership), apparel shopping (e.g., a mall or outlet), eating out (e.g., restaurants) or movie-going (e.g., movie theatres).
==========
We use this information to categorize Device users into “interest segments” – which advertisers can use to send ads when those users appear on mobile ad platforms they work with.
We also use some of the information we collect (including location information or mobile advertising IDs) to help advertisers analyze aggregate ad performance – such as by measuring whether or how Devices that saw a particular ad tended to engage with a particular product.
In addition, we sometimes use any or all of the above information to help advertisers better understand their customers or their marketing, such as for market research, customer analytics, or analytics of traffic patterns.
Pixel Data: As to data collected through pixels or web beacons (“Pixel Data”), we use such data to directly perform or allow our partners to perform aggregated “attribution” analysis, which can help marketers and their service providers understand which users have been exposed to which ad campaigns.
This may help marketers analyze and optimize their ad campaigns, for instance, on an aggregated basis.
This data may likewise be measured or matched against aggregate location data in order to provide a “match rate” for an attribution study as to devices that have been detected at a given location– to provide similar services and analysis for marketers as those described above.
For instance, if numerous Devices that were sent an ad or offer for “XYZ Coffee” on Tuesday then went to a XYZ Coffee on Wednesday or Thursday, an advertiser might conclude that the ad campaign was successful.
==========
We refer to all of the above services as the “Services.”
When you have accessed or used an App that uses the Services, the publishers of such App may allow us to automatically collect data about your Device and your activity and interaction with such App, which does not directly identify you and which may include:
IP address
Geolocation and proximity of your Device if location services are enabled on your Device
Unique Device identifiers for advertising (Google Advertiser ID or IDFA) and/or a pixel identifier
Event information about your Device, such as crashes, system activity, and hardware settings
System configuration information
Time and date information
Other personal data that publishers share with us
Dwell time near points of interest, as determined through beacon, Wi-Fi, and other signals as discussed below and our proprietary systems.
We may use these data to provide and improve the Services, including, but not limited to, the following purposes:
To develop and use predictive models to predict end users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-Device basis and across Devices
To provide targeted advertising to end users, including through the creation of user interest categories
To attribute end users’ visits to stores or other specific points of interest for advertising campaigns
To help publishers enhance their user profiles
We may share the data above, and our analytics related thereto, to provide and improve the Services and as follows:
With publishers for their advertising, analytics, or other purposes
With advertisers so they may provide targeted content and advertising to you on websites and mobile applications
With other third parties, such as demand-side platforms, advertising platforms, data management platforms, advertising agency trading desks, proximity solution providers, advertising technology providers, so they may provide targeted content and advertising to you on third-party websites, mobile applications, and other advertising mediums, and so that they may measure ad performance through the types of ad “attribution” we discuss above.
As otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy
Sometimes, we may provide information (such as IP address, but excluding precise lat/long coordinates) to third party platforms, connected to interest segments, to help advertisers identify common users across different Devices or browsers – for instance, to identify a common set of users on both mobile Devices or tablets, as well as the web.
==========
Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights.
When we collect location information (generally speaking, lat/long coordinates greater than two decimal places) from mobile App partners, we endeavor to work with partners that provide disclosures to their own users regarding the use of mobile data for interest-based advertising purposes, and regarding consumer opt out rights.
You may manage certain collection and sharing of information in connection with the Beintoo Website and our Services as follows:
You may control how your browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser.
This is described more fully in our Cookies Policy below.
==========
You may limit the disclosure of certain personal data by your mobile Device to us and publishers by adjusting the settings on your mobile Device.
For iOS mobile Devices, go to “Settings” from your Device’s home screen; scroll down to “Privacy”; select “Advertising”; and turn on “Limit Ad Tracking.”
For Android mobile Devices, go to “Google Settings” on your Device; select “Ads”; and check the box labeled “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads.”
We honor these “limit” or “opt out” instructions or “flags” by removing recognized Devices from our cross-app advertising or ad delivery and reporting solutions, on a going forward basis.
==========
(We may continue to use data from these Devices for other purposes, such as market research and aggregated customer analytics, but we will not use this information for interest-based advertising purposes.)
While we do not currently have a web-based solution, you may opt out of certain advertisers’ cookies and browser-enabled, interest-based advertising at the Network Advertising Initiative’s website here and the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website here.
Please note that these opt outs apply to interest-based advertising by participating advertisers.
You may still receive other types of online advertising from participating advertisers, and the websites you visit may still collect data for other purposes.
In addition, the opt-out choices you select are stored in opt-out cookies only in the browser that you use to visit the opt-out websites, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers or Devices you may use.
Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences, so you should visit these opt-out websites periodically to review your preferences or update your preferences to apply to new participating advertisers.
==========
Publishers and advertisers may also provide ways for you to opt out from or limit their collection of data from and about you.
Please refer to the privacy policies for the Apps to learn more about the privacy practices of publishers and advertisers.
Please note, however, that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of publishers, advertisers, and other third parties.
You may opt not to receive promotional emails from us by contacting us as indicated in this Privacy Policy or by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any promotional email you receive from us, or by contacting us at privacy-group@beintoo.com.
Please note, however, that we may still send you non-promotional, transactional or service-related emails about your relationship with us.

Cookies Policy
In addition to the information presented in our Privacy Policy, we are a third party in relation to the website and/or the mobile version of the website and/or the app where you are coming from (the
”Website of Origin”)
Since our services use cookies for several purposes, we hereby aim at explaining to you what cookies are and how they are used.
Certain cookies (the so called proprium cookies or first part cookies) are conveyed and controlled by us directly.
The Company collects and processes your personal data by means of these cookies.
We hereby explain to you how we collect such data, for which purposes and what your rights are, also pursuant to Article 13 of the Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30 June 2003 (the “Privacy Code”).
==========
Other cookies (i.e. third party cookies) are however conveyed and controlled by third parties.
In this policy (“Cookies Policy”) you will find links to the information published by these third parties, which we suggest you to read carefully.
What cookies are and what they are for.
Cookies are small text files that the websites visited by a user send directly to its terminal (usually, to the browser) for storage, where they are then recognized by the same website during the same user’s subsequent visits (the so called proprium first part cookies).
During the web surfing of a website, a user may also receive on its terminal cookies of other websites or of other web servers (the so called third parties cookies); this happens because there may be elements on the visited website, such as images, maps, sounds, links to specific web pages of other domains that are on servers other than the server on which the requested page is placed.
In other words, such cookies are set up on a website other than the one that is currently visited.
Cookies may have a duration limited to a single session of navigation on the browser (the so called session cookies), and, in such event, they deactivate automatically once the browser is closed by the user; or may have a predetermined duration and, in such event, they will remain memorized and active on your hard disk until the expiry date, thus continuing collecting information during different sessions of navigation on the browser (the so called permanent cookies).
==========
Cookies are used for several purposes.
Certain cookies are necessary in order to allow you to surf the website and benefit of its functionalities (the so called technical cookies).
Other cookies are used in order to obtain statistical information, whether in aggregate or not, about the number of users accessing the website and how the website is used (the so called monitoring cookies or analytics).
In addition, other cookies are used in order to track your consumer profile and display tailored advertisings that may be of interest for you, according to your preferences and your consumer habits (the so called profiling cookies).
Further details about these varying categories of cookies are described below.
Please discover how they work and for what they are used, and choose freely if you want to consent to their use or prevent the same.
Monitoring or “analytics” cookies.
==========
The analytics are used in order to collect statistical information, whether on aggregate or not, on the number of users accessing a service.
The analytics cookies are third parties cookies, since they are not conveyed directly by us they are not installed directly by the Company but by third parties subjects.
The following third parties analytics are installed with your prior consent, since the same are not anonymised, given that third parties can access to analytics disaggregated data at the IP address level (in other words, using these cookies, third parties could theoretically go back to your identity by means of the IP address):
You are clearly free to block the installation of analytics cookies in any moment whatsoever and this will not compromise in any manner whatsoever the possibility to visit the Website of Origin and benefit of its contents.
Please read carefully the third parties cookies policies, following the links specified in the above table, in order to know how to do it.
==========
Profiling cookies and/or other identifiers (both referred to as “Cookies”).
The profiling cookies are used to create a user’s profile, based on the preferences and likings showed by you during the navigation on Internet and to make you display advertisings consistent with your profile.
This is done to show you advertising that is more tailored and relevant to your interests.
==========
In order to disable these profiling cookies, either change your browser settings (see the paragraph (1) below) or read the section entitled “Information on Opting Out on Mobile Devices” found on the website https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice, and the “What Are My Options” section on the website https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options, which assist users in exercising their consumer choices on various devices.
Your prior consent is requested in order to install such cookies, as provided pursuant the current privacy law.
For such a reason, when you access the Website of Origin a specific banner is displayed, informing you that (i) profiling cookies are used on the Website of Origin and that (ii) closing the banner, surfing on the home page or clicking whatever element on the home page outside the banner, You are giving your consent to the use of cookies.
In the event that you express your consent to the use of cookies in this way, We will track your consent by means of a specific technical cookie.
In this way, we will avoid you displaying the cookies banner during your following visits of the Website of Origin.
Please take into account that, in the event that you remove from your browser such technical cookie with the modalities set forth under the following paragraph (1) below, the track of your consent would be lost and, therefore, the cookies banner will be displayed again during your following visit to the Website of Origin.
You are clearly free to block the installation of profiling cookies in any moment whatsoever and this will not compromise in any manner whatsoever the possibility to visit the Website of Origin and benefit of its contents.
Profiling systems, both cookie and Device data, will be installed by the Company itself (“first-party profiling cookies”).
These cookies are permanent and they expire within 12 months.
