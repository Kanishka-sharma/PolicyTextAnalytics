About realzeit

                        realzeit provides advanced solutions in mobile advertising ("Mobile DSP") retargeting and digital performance marketing for businesses, to help them understand their users and audiences (the "Products").
Depending on the solutions offered to our client we collect/process your information in order to ensure advertisers can provide you with relevant advertising based on your interests, affinities and local context and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.
The aim of this is to effectively reduce the amount of ads you see that aren't beneficial or of interest to you.
An opt-out from targeting would not reduce the amount of ads, it just makes the ads you receive less relevant.

Our purpose in collecting such data is to help us provide you with better service, such as more relevant notifications about special offers and promotions.
