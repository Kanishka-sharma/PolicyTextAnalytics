								    Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies to track your preferences and purchases as you navigate through our websites and to save you from having to re-enter information every time you visit an ULTA.com website.
By using cookies to track your visits, we can make your next shopping experience at an ULTA.com website better.
To search our websites and/or place an order on ULTA.com, you need to have the cookies feature of your web browser turned on.
Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookies by deleting them, blocking them, or alerting you when a cookie file is stored.
Please review your browser's instructions on these functions.

Advertising Networks
								    From time to time, we may use one or more third-party online advertising networks to serve ads on our behalf on the Internet.
The third-party network may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our ads.
For example, it may keep track of how many of our ads you saw before visiting our website.
This is primarily accomplished using technology such as cookies, action tags, web beacons, and/or GIF tags which are placed in various places within our website.
From time to time, we may share anonymous information with third-party network(s) in an aggregate form to help us analyze and improve our website.
The third-party network may use information about your visit to our website and other websites in order to provide ads about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

==========
We may disclose the information we collect about you (including personally identifiable information) to third parties to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and/or governmental requests.
We may also disclose such information to verify or enforce compliance with our User Agreement and Privacy Policy, to process and fill your order, reduce credit risk, protect against fraud, protect against misuse or unauthorized use of an ULTA.com website, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires such disclosure.

We may share the information collected at ULTA.com websites with agents or contractors who provide support for our internal operations.

								ULTA.com websites work to protect your personal information and credit card detail when you shop with us online.
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology - the industry standard - to encrypt the personal information and credit card detail you provide during the order process.
To ensure the security of your personal information, you should always provide that information over a secure connection.
==========
You can check the existence of a secure connection in one of two ways:
								    (1) Look at the URL in your web browser.
Whenever you are connected to a secure server, that connection will be represented in the URL as "https," rather than "http."
(2) Look at your web browser.
You know you have an SSL connection if you see a closed lock in Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above) or AOL (AOL 3.0 and above).
==========
We urge you to protect your own privacy.
We recommend that you do not share your ULTA.com website password(s) with anyone or in any unsolicited phone call or e-mail.
While ULTA.com websites strive to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, ULTA.com websites cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
==========
Please remember that any information you may disclose in public areas of our websites or the Internet becomes public information.
