Quantcast Tags
“Quantcast Tags” (a.k.a. Web Beacons or Pixel Tags) are tiny graphics, used in conjunction with cookies to help us gather Log Data.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Tags are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by Quantcast Tags to the personally identifiable information of visitors to a Web site.
Log Data

“Log Data” includes:
            
Information sent by your browser such as pixel code, referring HTTP location, current HTTP location, search string, time of the access, browser’s time, any searches made on the applicable website, and other statistics (we do not store full IP addresses), and
                Information received from Quantcast software embedded in third party mobile applications.
The data collected by the software may include: Device information, location information (including city-level geolocation), application data and use information, and unique application and installation identifiers.
==========
We retain Log Data for 13 months to accommodate seasonality.
When you visit the Quantcast.com Site, whether as a Quantcast Client, Registered User or Quantcast Visitor, our servers automatically record and collect Log Data sent by your browser.
We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze the use of the Quantcast.com Site and the Services, for the Quantcast.com Site’s technical administration, to increase the Quantcast.com Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.
==========
For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Quantcast.com Site again, it will recognize you and will be able to serve content, advertisements, and other information appropriate to your interests.
We also collect Log Data each time you visit third-party websites serving content that has been tagged by Quantcast Clients with Quantcast Tags.
We analyze Log Data from different websites and combine it with other non Personally Identifiable Information to produce the Reports that are made available on the Quantcast.com Site, and to enable web publishers and advertisers to deliver audience segments that are appropriate for their products or services.
This combined data is also used by us and our partners to serve you content, advertisements, and other information tailored to your interests.
==========
We provide a cross-platform reporting service to website and mobile application owners.
Website and mobile application owners provide Quantcast with hashed (scrambled) identifiers to associate your use on their mobile and online platforms.
Our clients use our Market Research Services to understand their current and historical audience characteristics.
==========
We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity.
We make efforts to require our Quantcast Clients to ensure that any such third party website post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights of their visitors.
Check the privacy policies of websites tagged with Quantcast Tags for information regarding the applicable privacy practices.
