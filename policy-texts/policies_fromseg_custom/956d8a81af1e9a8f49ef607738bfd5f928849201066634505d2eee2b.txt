Privacy Statement
Omniture and its Subsidiaries are the leading providers of on-demand, online business optimization services, delivering essential data insights to improve the performance of online business and marketing initiatives.
We have created this privacy statement (the "Product Privacy Statement") to demonstrate our commitment to our customers, the privacy of their website visitors, and the right of privacy throughout the Internet.
Privacy is of great importance to us.
==========
Because we gather important information on behalf of our corporate customers on portions of their websites and/or other online and offline sources, we have established this Product Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Please note that further information regarding our practices with regards to our website at www.omniture.com can be found at:

Customer Data
We and/or our Subsidiaries (as the context dictates) act as a limited agent (and data processor in the EU context) to each of our customers only for the purpose of providing Internet data hosting and optimization products and services, for which summaries and additional details are described within the “Products” and “Services” portions of this site.
Our corporate customers may use information that has been gathered by us on their website(s) and other information provided to us (by the customer or their trusted partners) to create web properties and applications that are easier to use and are more appealing to their visitors.
This information may include (but is not limited by) general website traffic patterns, most popular pages visited, referring domains, referring search engines, campaign success rates, visitor attrition rates, and types of product(s) purchased.
==========
Our corporate customers may also request that we receive or gather personally identifiable information that has been rightfully obtained by the corporate customer, such as (but not limited by) email addresses of certain participating visitors to their website(s).
All such information is and will remain customer property, and will be treated by Omniture as proprietary and confidential information of each customer, respectively.
As such, and subject to the remainder of this paragraph, Omniture will not disclose such information to any third party, unless specifically and rightfully instructed or directed to do so by the customer, or unless it is transferred among our Subsidiaries solely for the purposes of processing such instructions or directions.
Omniture will not review, share, disclose, distribute, print, or reference any such information except as requested or directed by the customer or as may be required by law.
Individual customer records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, addressing a support issue, fulfilling a billing requirement, or as may be required by law.
Our corporate customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their usernames and passwords to log into their accounts.
We may store and process personal information in the United States or any other country in which we or any of our Subsidiaries maintain facilities.

Cookies and Clear GIFs
What Are Cookies
Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that are designed to store basic information (such as visitor preferences).
Most of our customers use cookies on their websites in connection with our products and services, for which summaries and additional details are described within the “Products” and “Services” portions of this site.
This helps our customers to better estimate the number of individual anonymous visitors to their website(s).
==========
There are two types of cookies that may be used: session and persistent.
Session cookies exist only during a website visitor’s online session.
They disappear from the visitor’s computer when he/she closes the browser software.
Persistent cookies remain on the visitor’s computer after the browser has been closed.
When examining your cookies you may notice a cookie that is set by the domain - 2o7.
net.
The 2o7.
==========
net domain is the primary domain our corporate customers use to measure visitor behavior on their website(s) (which cookie is set by us, acting on our customer’s behalf).
Controlling the Use of Cookies
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies set by our customers if you prefer.
If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.
For further information about disabling cookies you can visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
==========
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of certain web sites and services that depend on cookies.
What Are Clear GIFs?
Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help our customers understand how visitors interact with their websites.
==========
A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site.
The use of a clear gif allows the website owner to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif.
Most of our customers use clear gifs on their websites in connection with our products and services, for which summaries and additional details are described within the “Products” and “Services” portions of this site.
Controlling the Use of Clear GIFs
Because clear gifs are included within the recipe for a web page (just the same as any other content request), you cannot opt out or refuse them.
However, where they are used in conjunction with cookies they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or by changing the cookie settings in your browser (see above Section titled "Controlling our use of Cookies").
In other instances, such as in the case of emails, clear gifs are not used in conjunction with cookies and if you are unhappy with the use of clear gifs in such manner, then you should not use the website in question.
==========
Customer Policies
We strongly recommend that our customers, as data controllers (in the EU context), add statements or clauses to their privacy policies specifically describing their use of third party hosted optimization products and services (such as those provided by Omniture) and describing the details of such third party products and services (such as the use of cookies and clear gifs/web beacons).
Further, we strongly recommend that each of our customers provide their visitors with information regarding the ability to opt-out of session data aggregation and analysis (see opt out section below).
It is very important that you review the respective privacy policy of each customer website that you visit, because such privacy policies govern the use of information on those websites, including our customer’s use of Omniture, including our Subsidiarys’, products and services where applicable.
