Information Collection and Use
Turn is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and is in compliance with the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Principles.
Overview of Turn’s Technology
Our Technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online.
You may encounter our Technology: when Turn or one of our Business Partners purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when one of our Business Partners places one of our web beacons on its website, which you visit.
We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make the Turn Ads you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
==========
What information is collected?
Turn does not collect PII via our Technology.
Our Technology does collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many Business Partner web pages have been viewed, search terms entered on Business Partner websites, referring/exit pages, and the date and time a Turn Ad was viewed.
==========
Turn uses this information to analyze trends, identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement and to tailor advertisement placement for our Business Partners accordingly.
We also may aggregate this information and share it with Turn’s affiliates, advertisers, employees, customers and Business Partners.
Turn does not create nor use any sensitive data segments to tailor ads on behalf of our advertiser clients.
However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive.
In order to provide transparency around potentially sensitive data segments collected and used by Turn, we will provide examples of them here.
==========
For example, we may collect health related segments of consumers that we believe may have an interest in healthy living because they have visited websites that are focused on health related topics such as yoga and healthy living.
Similarly, we may collect financial related segments of consumers that we believe may have an interest in investing because they’ve visited websites that are focused on investment strategies or searched for ”investment tips.”
While we don’t consider any of the above data segments to be sensitive, we think it’s important to provide this transparency to help you have a better idea of which segments might be collected by us, so you can make informed decisions.
==========
Cookies and Web Beacons
Turn uses cookies and web beacons in connection with our Technology.
Cookies help Turn better understand the effectiveness of a Turn Ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, selectand interact with a Turn Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view a Turn Ad).
Turn’s cookies also help control the number of times you view a Turn Ad.
==========

==========
As an alternative to deletion/disabling of cookies, you can also choose to opt out of cookie-based data collection.
Turn also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns.
The use of a web beacon allows Turn to record that someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.

Turn Ads may contain links to other websites, including those of our Business Partners.
Such websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools.

Info Storage / Security / Integrity
Storage of Non-PII
We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 180 days in order to ensure that our Technology is functioning properly.

Information Security
The security of your information is important to us.
We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it.
This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

back to top
Access/ Info Sharing/ Disclosure
Turn will allow an individual access to their Personal Information to the extent it is available and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
If you’d like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any PII that you have provided to us, please send your request to us at privacy@turn.com and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.
