  http://canvas.instructure.com/ (“Site”) and/or the services or functionality made available or enabled via the Site by Instructure, to
  facilitate the sharing of information and collaboration between students, teachers and administrators
  (“Services”).
This Privacy Policy applies to you

  you and we provide the Site and Services on behalf of your school.
User Consent.

==========
A Note About Children.
We do not intentionally
    gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13, except to the extent we provide services to those
    visitors on behalf of schools.
More specifically, a school (or a teacher, on behalf of a school) may contract
    with us to offer our service solely for the benefit of its students and for the school’s system.
It is
    up to the schools for which we act as a service provider to obtain the parents’ consent for the collection
    and use of their children’s Personal Data.
==========
A Note to Users Outside of the United States.
Your
    Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the
    United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your
    country.

Disclosure of Your Personal Data

Affiliates.
==========
Although we currently do not have
        a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively,

We may share some or
        all of your Personal Data with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy

Third Parties

Social Networking Websites.
We may from
        time to time provide applications for certain social networking websites (“Social
        Networking Websites”) (e.g., a Facebook application).
If you choose to install and use
        those applications, Instructure may share information with the Social Networking Website to support your use of the
        application.
For example, if you use the application to publish Instructure related notices on your Facebook
        wall, we will provide Facebook the applicable information.

The privacy policies of the Social
        Networking Sites may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information that we collect and disclose to

Third Party Websites.
Our provision of a link or
        application that links to any other website or location (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, or Skype), is for your
        convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents.
When you click
        on such a link/app, you will leave our Site and go to another site.
==========
During this process, another entity may collect
        Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.
We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for,
        these outside websites or their content.
Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to
        these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links/apps to such outside

        provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Site, conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate
        creation of accounts, provide technical support, or provide specific services to Instructure.
