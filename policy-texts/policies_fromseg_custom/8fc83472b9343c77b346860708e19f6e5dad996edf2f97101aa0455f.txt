DSTILLERY’S TECHNOLOGY PRIVACY PRACTICES


Dstillery is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and is in compliance with the NAI’s 2015 Self-Regulatory Code.
Dstillery is also in compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-regulatory Code.
==========
Our technology collects non-PII (defined above) from mobile apps and websites, including this Website and utilizes that information to deliver interest based advertising.
We also may allow other third-party advertisers to collect Non-PII from this Website and utilize it to deliver relevant ads and for other purposes in accordance with the DAA and NAI Codes.
You may opt-out from interest-based advertising by clicking onto the DAA and NAI opt-out mechanisms.
==========
Technology Overview
Dstillery’s technology uses “network neighbor” data to help our clients deliver relevant digital advertisements on websites and mobile apps.
“network neighbors” are generally two or more people that visit the same website pages, utilize the same wifi network or use the same mobile apps.
For example, a network neighbor might be someone whose social networking profile page you’ve visited, used the same mobile application you’ve used or someone that visits the same website that you visit.
Network neighbors are likely to share many similar interests, hobbies, and other key demographic characteristics with you, although we don’t typically know what (if any) interests or hobbies are shared by any group of network neighbors.
==========
Rather, Dstillery believes that if you’re interested in a particular product or service, your network neighbors are likely to also be interested in that product or service.
Therefore, by understanding whom your network neighbors are and what they like, the company’s proprietary technology will do a better job determining the digital ads that are likely to be of interest to you.
Dstillery’s technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit (including this Website), the mobile apps that you use and the ads that you see.
And where we can reasonably infer that a particularly computer or device belong to the same household, we may extend our advertising and targeting capabilities across multiple devices.
You may encounter our technology when: Dstillery or one of our clients purchases digital ads on a website that you visit or a mobile app that you use or when one of our clients places a web beacon on a website that you visit.
The company uses the information collected in order to help make the digital ads you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
==========
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.
Please note our opt-out only applies to the browser on a particular device that has opted out and does not opt you out of being served advertising.
You will continue to receive ads, but those ads will not be targeted via our technology.
For more information about our opt-out mechanisms, including our mobile application choice mechanisms, please scroll down to the section of this Privacy Policy entitled: “Controlling The Use of Your Information”.
==========
Types of Information We Collect via Our Technology
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
The company’s technology doesn’t collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”).
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via our technology, including but not limited to browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider, IP address, and basic ad serving information such as the time and date an ad is served, the name of the mobile app or URLs from the web page visited.
==========
We also work with partners to enable our clients to bring their offline data into our systems for use by our technology.
Our technology does not collect or use health information that we consider sensitive, but you may see the health-related segments we did use by clicking here.
All of the data collected by our technology is de-identified prior to being used for ad targeting.
Similarly, where we use precise location information such as GPS coordinates obtained from a mobile app, we have a reasonable process to de-identify that information.
==========
Cookies, Web Beacons
Dstillery’s technology uses cookies, web beacons and similar technologies in order to help make the digital advertisements you see are more relevant to you.
Dstillery uses cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to understand browsing, buying and other internet usage activities so that we can better target and measure the success of digital ad campaigns and the campaigns of our clients.
==========
Public Forums
Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
==========
Storage of Data Collected
Dstillery retains some data collected via its technology in its original form for up to 30 days in order to ensure that our technology is functioning properly.

Controlling The Use Of Your Information
Opting Out from Interest Based Advertising (our “Choice Mechanism”)
Websites.
If you’d like to opt out from having Dstillery use your information to target advertising, please click here.
When you opt out, Dstillery will attempt to place an opt-out cookie on your computer or device.
The opt-out cookie tells our technology not to use your data to target ads on websites from that computer or device.
Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
==========
Mobile Apps.
Mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) offer opt-out choice mechanisms applicable to mobile applications and these choice mechanisms may be found via your mobile device settings.
And Dstillery participates in the DAA AppChoices mobile opt-out application as part of honoring the DAA Code for the Mobile Environment.
Where our systems detect that a user of a device has opted out via their mobile operating system, our technology won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device.
Similarly, when our systems indicate that a user of a device has opted-out out from Dstillery via AppChoices, our technology won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device.
Please note that these opt-out choice mechanisms only apply to the particular device that has opted out and does not opt you out of being served advertising.
You will continue to receive ads, but those ads will not be targeted via our technology.
==========
Precise Location.
If you’d like to adjust your choices regarding the use of precise location data by third parties such as Dstillery, you may do so via your device settings.
Also, most mobile applications that collect precise location information offer choice mechanisms.
Please note that these choice mechanisms won’t impact previously collected precise location information that has been de-identified.
==========
Data Integrity
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
==========
