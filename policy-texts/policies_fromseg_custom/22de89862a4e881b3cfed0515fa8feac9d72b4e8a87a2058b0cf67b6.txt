Real Cities Network Privacy Statement
 
      The Real Cities Network (or "RCN") is a national network of Internet site 
      and services serving geographic and common interest communities across the 
      United States.
The privacy policies described below are applicable to each 
      site in the Real Cities Network.
You can view the sites included in the 
      Real Cities Network at http://www.realcities.com.
==========
When does the RCN collect my personally identifiable information?
When you register at one of the RCN sites or services, we collect personally 
      identifying information from you.
The more information you provide, the 
      better we are able to customize our services and your experience to suit 
      your needs and preferences.
For example, if you utilize the "Passport" registration 
      feature offered at many of the RCN sites, we will ask you for a username, 
      password, e-mail address and zip code.
Other sites and specific services 
      (e.g. free e-mail) will have different registration processes, and may require 
      you to provide additional personally identifying information such as your 
      address, phone number and gender.
==========
In addition to registration, we may collect 
      personally identifiable information from you when you enter contests, and 
      sweepstakes, participate in promotions and special programs, register for 
      premium or customized services, make a purchase at one of our merchants 
      or partners, subscribe to one our print papers or magazines, or download 
      a software product or plug-in.
If you are making a purchase or enrolling 
      in a premium service for which there is a fee, we will collect your credit 
      card, billing address, and other verifying information.
In addition, we 
      may collect personally identifiable information from you when you provide 
      content to us for display or use on one or more of the sites in the RCN, 
      including but limited to, when you participate in user surveys, post messages 
      to bulletin boards or chat areas, submit personals or other classified listings, 
      build a home page, report a problem with one of our sites or services, or 
      submit a letter to the editor.
How is my personally identifiable information used?
Our main goal is to provide you with a customized and targeted user experience 
      within the Real Cities Network.
For instance, your personally identifiable 
      information enables us to greet you when you return to a Real Cities site 
      or service, and provide you with news and services we think will be of interest 
      to you.
==========
We review our users' preferences, demographics, traffic patterns, 
      and other information in the aggregate so that we can better understand 
      who our audience is and what it is you want.
Tracking user preferences also 
      helps us serve you targeted advertising.
Targeted advertisements are probably 
      more interesting for you, and are definitely more productive for our advertisers.
If a local grocery market wants to advertise an upcoming sale, we can target 
      the ad to registered users who live near that grocery market.
==========
Please note 
      that we do not share your personally identifying information with the advertiser.
We or third party ad servers acting on our behalf act as the middleman between 
      you and the advertisers that want to reach you.
(Third party ad servers are 
      not entitled to collect or use your personally identifying information).
==========
We use the information we collect in non-intrusive common sense ways, like 
      using your credit card number to provide you with products and/or services 
      that you request.
All credit card information is transmitted in an encrypted 
      form, using SSL (secure socket layer) encryption, the industry-standard.
Although, we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of 
      your personal information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot 
      be made absolutely secure.
The RCN assumes no liability for disclosure of 
      data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized third parties.
==========
Finally, if you register for one or more of our sites or services, from 
      time to time, we will send information to you via e-mail about our products 
      and services, or third party products and services we believe may be of 
      interest to you.
If you do not wish to receive these mailings, you can simply 
      check off the appropriate box when you register, or update your profile 
      at any time after registration so you no longer receive such offers and 
      mailings.
Please check the registration screens applicable to the service, 
      promotion, or product offering for which you are signing-up for specific 
      instructions on how to update your user profile and/or opt out of receiving 
      offers and mailings.
Also, please remember that third party vendors also 
      sell products and services on the Real Cities network, and their policies 
      may differ from ours.
==========
What other information does RCN collect and how is it used?
Cookies.
The RCN uses cookies to store and track your preferences 
      to provide you with a more personalized user experience.
A cookie is a message 
      that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's 
      hard drive.
Most Internet sites use cookies.
You can set your browser preferences 
      to reject all cookies (see below) but then you will not be able to participate 
      in most customized services, and you may be required to repeatedly type 
      in your personally identifying information in order to participate in various 
      services, promotions, or product offerings.
==========
Cookies make your experience 
      easier by saving your preferences, purchases, and passwords.
For example 
      if you choose "Automatic Login" during registration, the RCN will store 
      a scrambled version of your username in a permanent "cookie" file on your 
      hard drive so that we can track your personalized services and preferences 
      from one visit to the next.
We also use cookies that contain no personal 
      information at all.
These cookies, help us estimate our audience size, determine 
      which areas of the RCN are the most popular, and serve targeted advertising.
==========
IP Address.
The RCN may also collect IP addresses for the purposes 
      of systems administration or to report information in aggregate form to 
      our advertisers (e.g. how many visitors logged in to a RCN site).
An IP 
      address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when 
      you use the Internet.
When you visit a particular web page in the Real Cities 
      Network, our servers log your IP address.
Your IP address is not linked 
      to anything personally identifiable.
==========
Who does RCN share information with?
User information is shared by the RCN sites in order to provide you with 
      a more integrated and customized user experience within the Real Cities 
      Network.
In general, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information 
      to third parties except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested 
      product or service, or under circumstances required by law.
However, many 
      of the services available through the Real Cities Network are offered in 
      conjunction with third parties (e.g. personalized stock quotes or online 
      e-mail).
We may disclose some or your personal information (such as an email 
      address) to these third parties, but we will notify you of such disclosure 
      prior to transferring the data.
==========
If you make a purchase from a Real Cities 
      Network merchant, the information you provide in connection with that purchase 
      is provided to that merchant in order to facilitate that transaction.
Any 
      personally identifiable information you provide online as part of an advertiser 
      promotion (e.g. online coupons) may be provided directly to advertisers.
In general we will only disclose your personally identifiable information 
      to the extent necessary to complete the transaction, administer the promotion, 
      or fulfill the request.
==========
However, specific uses of personal information that 
      vary from this Privacy Statement may be found the in the Terms of Service 
      or privacy policies applicable to that particular service or offering.
In 
      addition, third party sponsors may administer sweepstakes, contests, promotions, 
      and other programs.
To the extent you are notified of uses of your personal 
      information which are different from those described in this Policy Statement 
      during your enrollment in any particular service, sweepstakes, contest or 
      promotion, the uses of which you are specifically notified will govern that 
      service, sweepstakes, contest or promotion.
Please be on the look-out for 
      terms of service and privacy statements applicable to the services for which 
      you sign-up or participate in.
==========
In general, third parties that receive information 
      about you from the Real Cities Network will be obligated to notify you and 
      provide you with an opt-out method before sending you direct communications.
Please note, however, that we do not control the privacy policies of our 
      advertisers and other third party sites to which we provide banner ads and 
      links.
We assume no responsibility or liability for these third party policies 
      or the actions of non-affiliated third parties.
We will disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith 
      that any applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or where 
      we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the 
      rights of another user.
We disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, the percentage of our 
      users who access our Service from work) in order to describe our services 
      and reach to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties.
However aggregate data is not traceable to you specifically.
What are my options to control the use of my personal information?
==========
Most browsers can be configured to reject cookies or alert you when cookies 
      or being sent.
Keep in mind that if you refuse cookies, it is possible that 
      some portions of the Real Cities Network, such as contests, shopping, or 
      personalized stock quotes may not work properly.
You may cancel your registration to any Real Cities Network service (e.g. 
      Passport") and/or request the removal of your personal information from 
      our user records by contacting us through our feedback 
      form.
We will send an email to confirm your request.
After you respond, 
      we will remove your information from our database.
Residual information 
      may remain in our archives and records, but this information will not be 
      used for a commercial purpose (however we may notify you of major changes 
      to our service from time to time).
We reserve the right to maintain information 
      on registered users who have violated our Terms of Service or who have had 
      their access to the Real Cities Network blocked in order to detect repeat 
      offenders.
==========
What else should I know about my privacy?
You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information 
      online in a public area, that information may be collected and used by others.
We do not control the actions of our visitors and registered users.
If you 
      disclose personal information in a chat room, forum, on your home page, 
      or any other publicly accessible place in the RCN, you do so at your own 
      risk and you understand that your submitted information may be collected 
      and used by others to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements, or 
      for other purposes.
Please remember that protection of your privacy begins with you.
You are 
      solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use to 
      register, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing 
      information online.
What about kids' personally identifiable information?
We feel strongly about protecting the privacy of children.
We encourage 
      kids to involve their parents in any interactive activity they participate 
      in online.
==========
Except where otherwise disclosed, we will not collect or use 
      any personal information from children we know to be under the age of thirteen 
      without obtaining express parental consent.
All general information collected 
      from users under the age of thirteen is used only for aggregate statistical 
      analysis.
Where users under the age of 13 are permitted to participate in 
      contests, they may be required to provide the e-mail address of their parent 
      or guardian so that we can send notification and prices to the parent or 
      guardian.
==========
