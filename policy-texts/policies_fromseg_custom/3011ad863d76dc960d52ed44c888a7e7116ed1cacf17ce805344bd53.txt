Privacy Policy
Open Culture respects each individualâ€™s right to personal privacy.
In general, we try to collect as little information about our readers as possible.
And we will use information collected through our Web site only in the ways disclosed in this statement.
Part I. Information Collection
Open Culture does not require readers to create user accounts.
The only cases in which we receive user information is as follows:
1) If you sign up to receive daily updates via email (which is managed by Feedburner.
Get more info below).
In these cases, we will never offer or sell your email addresses to another party.
2) If you post a comment to our site.
In this case, we ask that you provide a valid email address, and, again, we will never offer or sell your email addresses to another party.
3) If you fill out our contact form.
This requires you to input your name and email address, which we will keep private at all times.
