Premium Services and Payment
Premium Services
There are two primary ways that we support the Ning Platform: through advertising and Premium Services.
As a Network Creator, you can purchase one or more Premium Services from us.
The categories and prices of our Premium Services are described here and are subject to change from time to time ("Premium Services Policies").
==========
Ning may choose to temporarily change the fees for the Premium Services for promotional or new services, and such changes are immediately effective when Ning posts the temporary promotional event or new service on the Ning Platform.
Any changes to fees for Premium Services that are not temporary or promotional will be effective thirty (30) days after we provide you with notice by posting such changes on the Ning Platform.
The changes shall only apply prospectively to the Premium Services you've purchased.
==========
Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.
Payment Generally
You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the Premium Services in a timely manner with a valid payment method.
You authorize Ning to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, or financial institution account (herein "Payment Method") for all charges to your accounts with Ning.
Your Payment Method will be charged the current fee for the Premium Service you choose on the date that you click on the "Purchase" button in the ordering process.
Today, we only offer recurring payments.
You agree that Ning may automatically charge the fee to your Payment Method at the beginning of each recurring period.
==========
For example, if you choose a Premium Service with a monthly plan, you will be billed every month on the anniversary date of the date you clicked the "Purchase" button.
Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option for payment of Premium Services ("Pre-Payment Plan").
If you opt for Pre-Payment plan, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee for that Premium Service at the commencement of each renewal period.

in a manner that constitutes or contains any form of advertising or solicitation if (1) posted in Your Content; or (2) emailed to Users who have requested not to be contacted about other services, products or commercial interests.
Additionally, you agree not to:

"Stalk" or otherwise harass anyone;
Collect, use or disclose data, including personal information, about other Users without their consent or for unlawful purposes or in violation of applicable law or regulations;
Request, solicit or otherwise obtain access to usernames, passwords or other authentication credentials from any Member of the Ning Platform, including Ning ID passwords or any Master Key from a Network Creator, or to proxy authentication credentials for any Member of the Ning Platform for the purposes of automating logins to the Ning Platform;
Use any profanity or the description or name of any illegal activity in the name of Your Network or the Network Subdomain (as defined below) for Your Network;
Post any Content containing child pornography to any Social Network.
Ning absolutely does not tolerate this and will report any suspected instances of child pornography, including reporting any Ning Member Data, to law enforcement, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children;
Use automated means, including spiders, robots, crawlers, data mining tools, or the like to download data from Social Networks and the Ning Platform - except for Internet search engines (e.g. Google) and non-commercial public archives (e.g. archive.org) that comply with our robots.txt file, or "well-behaved" web services/RSS/Atom clients.
We reserve the right to define what we mean by "well-behaved";
Post irrelevant Content, repeatedly post the same or similar Content or otherwise impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Ning's infrastructure;
Attempt to gain unauthorized access to Ning's computer systems or engage in any activity that disrupts, diminishes the quality of, interferes with the performance of, or impairs the functionality of, the Ning Platform;
Take any action that may undermine the feedback or ratings systems (such as displaying, importing or exporting feedback information off of the Ning Platform or for using it for purposes unrelated to Ning); and
Develop, invoke, or utilize any code to disrupt, diminish the quality of, interfere with the performance of, or impair the functionality of the Ning Platform.
You agree not to authorize or encourage any third party to use the Ning Platform or any of your Networks (and Your Networks will not be designed) to facilitate any of the foregoing prohibited conduct.
You also agree to immediately notify Ning in the event of an actual or threatened claim that you have violated any of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.
==========
Additionally, if you are a Network Creator, you also agree not to post or permit posting of adult Content ("Adult Content") on your Network, unless notice of such Adult Content is provided to Users first.
Networks with Adult Content visible to Users who are not Network Members of such Networks with Adult Content may be shut down at Ning's sole discretion and without notice.
Ning also reserves the right at its sole discretion and option to institute additional requirements upon any Network Creator in allowing access to Network Members of its Network where Adult Content is posted.

Ning Platform Policies
Ning may establish general polices and limits concerning use of the Ning Platform ("Ning Platform Policies"), including (and without limitation) the maximum number of days that Social Networks and uploaded Content will be retained, the maximum number of and size of Content files and objects (including email messages), the maximum disk space allotted to you or Your Network(s), the maximum number of times and duration for which you may access the Ning Platform or Networks in a given period of time, the maximum bandwidth used by Your Network(s) or Content, and the maximum CPU power used by Your Networks or Content.
The current Ning Platform Policies are part of this Agreement.
16.
==========
Ning's Relationship with Users
You acknowledge that Ning may terminate your account (which is separate from a Network Creator's right to terminate your account), and remove your Ning ID, Content and Network Member Data, as well as disable your access to any and all Social Networks and the Ning Platform, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
If you are a Network Member, you acknowledge that nothing in any agreement (or related policies) you may be subject to with any Network Creator or other party will alter, impair, supersede, amend or otherwise affect in any way any terms of this Agreement, any Guidelines or Ning's Privacy Policy.
17.
==========
Copyright Infringement/Digital Millennium Copyright Act Compliance
It is Ning's policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").
For more information, please go to Ning's DMCA Notification Guidelines.
Ning may remove any allegedly infringing Network Code or Content without any liability to you.
==========
Ning will promptly terminate without notice any Member's (including, for clarity, Network Member's or Network Creator's) access to the Ning Platform, including access to any Social Network, in appropriate circumstances where the Member is a "repeat infringer" of copyrights.
Generally, Ning will consider a Member a repeat infringer if it has received more than two third-party notices of alleged infringement concerning Content or Network Code posted by that Member anywhere on the Ning Platform.
Ning, however, reserves the right to identify and terminate Members under any circumstances it deems appropriate, including after only a single instance of allegedly infringing behavior by that Member.
==========
Additionally, if a Network Creator continues to allow its Network Member's to post Content that is subject to notices of alleged copyright infringement, the Network may (at Ning's sole discretion) be disabled.
Additionally, if you are a Network Creator, you agree to: promptly (and in any event in no more than 24 hours) address (including removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content for valid DMCA take down notices) any copyright owner's written notice (including any notices forwarded to you by Ning) that specified Content or Network Code posted on Your Network infringes that third-party's rights (including copyrights), provided that the notice substantially complies with the requirements in the DMCA.
If you receive a counter-notice from the applicable Member that substantially complies with the requirements of the DMCA instructing you to replace the allegedly infringing Content or Network Code, you agree to replace or cease disabling access to the Content or Network Code not less than ten (10) and no more than fourteen (14) days after receiving the counter notice, provided that the complaining party has not notified you that it has filed an action against the Member regarding the alleged infringement.
==========
You also agree to forward a copy of the counter notice to Ning.
Ning strongly recommends that you consult with a legal professional to confirm your obligations under the DMCA.
Ning is not providing legal advice to you and nothing in this Agreement is legal advice nor guarantees your compliance with applicable law or regulation.
You are solely responsible and liable for complying with all applicable laws, including copyright and privacy laws in connection with Your Network.
18.
==========
Network Member Data
Through our Ning Member Services, Ning collects Ning Member Data from Your Network Members and general information about a User's use of Your Network(s).
If you are a Network Creator or Administrator, you agree that your access to this Ning Member Data (including the email addresses provided by Network Members during the Ning ID registration process ) as part of the management controls of Your Network(s) is subject to the Ning Privacy Policy.
In addition, subject to this Agreement, you may collect Network Member Data from Your Social Network Members; if you do so, you hereby agree that such Network Member Data shall not be used in a manner inconsistent with, or that causes Ning to violate Ning's Privacy Policy.
Member privacy is important to us.
==========
Therefore, if you are a Network Creator or an Administrator, you hereby agree that your use and disclosure of Network Member Data and any Ning Member Data shall: (a) comply with all Guidelines; and (b) be reasonably protective of each Network Member's rights and in no event shall you observe standards of privacy and confidentiality in connection with the use and disclosure of Ning Member Data or Network Member Data that are less stringent than the standards set forth in the Ning Privacy Policy.
You must clearly communicate on Your Network that Your Network uses Ning ID authentication (including, on each page on Your Network on which information is collected for purposes of Ning ID authentication) and that each of Your Network Members will be sharing the data they provide to you with Ning.
==========
This is for clarity and to ensure Your Network Members are aware of this relationship.
Subject to this Agreement and each Network Member's rights, all Network Member Data shall be the property of the applicable Network Creators.
==========
That being said, Ning needs to run Your Network on the Ning Platform.
To this end, as a Network Creator, you hereby grant Ning a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicenseable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license to (i) use, reproduce, store, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and display the Network Member Data on or through the Ning Platform and in all current and future media in which the Ning Platform may be distributed; (ii) use and disclose the Network Member Data and related metrics in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in targeting advertising in a non-personally identifiable manner through and in connection with the Ning Platform; and (iii) use Network Member Data for other purposes permitted by the Ning Privacy Policy.
==========
You acknowledge that Ning may receive requests from Users or persons authorized to act on behalf of such Users to modify or delete personally identifiable information relating to such Users on Your Network.
Accordingly, you agree that, within 24 hours of any email request by Ning, you will: (a) delete all Network Member Data and other personally identifiable information in your possession or control relating to a particular User as specified by Ning; and (b) confirm such deletion in email notice to Ning.
Ning is not required to keep back-up copies of Network Member Data on the Ning Platform once the Network or Network Member Data is deleted.
Ning makes no guarantee that Network Member Data will be safely stored on the Ning Platform.
To be safe, you should independently back-up Network Member Data.
19.
==========
Your Social Network
We want to give you as a Network Creator as much freedom to create and control the Social Networks you build on the Ning Platform as possible.
You may have your own agreement(s) or policies between you and each of Your Network Members, provided that each such agreement or policies do not supersede, amend or otherwise affect in any way any terms of this Agreement, any Guidelines or our Privacy Policy and provided that you allow Ning to display the Ning Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and any Guidelines on your Social Network.
To enable a great experience for all Users on the Ning Platform, if you are a Network Creator, you agree to ensure each Social Network you create or manage does not degrade the performance of the Ning Platform.
If your Social Network(s) exceed the quotas and limitations set by Ning (e.g., storage or bandwidth) as set forth in the Ning Platform Policies or otherwise degrades performance of the Ning Platform or other services in any way, we may suspend your Social Network(s) at our sole discretion and without notice.
You agree not to harvest any email addresses from Networks or the Ning Platform for the purpose of sending email in violation of applicable law or otherwise violate the "Acceptable Use and Conduct" provisions of this Agreement.
==========
You also agree not to knowingly collect any information from, or develop any Networks that are targeted at children under the age of 13.
You acknowledge that Ning may terminate the account of any Member (including Your Social Network Members) in accordance with these Terms of Service.
==========
Your Network shall not be designed or implemented in a way that, as determined by Ning in its sole discretion, might mislead a User into believing that: (i) he or she is interacting directly with Ning when interacting with Your Network, or (ii) any of Your Network was created by or are endorsed by Ning.
Because we want you to have as much freedom over your Network as possible, Ning takes no responsibility for any Content located in Your Network and Ning has no obligation to monitor such Content or Your Network.
You acknowledge that Ning also reserves the right to remove, preserve, and disclose any information or Content on any Social Network (including Ning ID and Network Member Data) or account it deems necessary or appropriate to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) enforce this Agreement, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, (d) respond to User support requests, (e) protect the rights, property, or safety of Ning, its Users, and the general public, or (f) investigate or defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations.
20.
==========
Your Account
You need to register and create a Ning ID in order to become a Ning Member, Network Member or Network Creator on the Ning Platform.
As a Network Creator or Administrator, you will also create a separate security password ("Master Key").
This Master Key provides you as a Network Creator or Administrators another level of security in creating and managing your Social Network(s).
==========
You are responsible for keeping both your Ning ID password and your Master Key secure.
Ning IDs are non-transferable.
You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your Ning ID.
==========
Ning reserves the right to log off or deactivate Member accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time.
When you create Your Network, Ning gives you the flexibility to choose your own subdomain for Your Network (e.g., networkcreators in the example: http://developer.ning.com) ("Network Subdomain").
You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under Your Network's Subdomain.
Ning maintains ownership of your Network Subdomain and grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, freely revocable, license solely to use the Network Subdomain on the Ning Platform.
You may not use anyone else's account, Ning ID or Network Subdomain at any time, without the permission of the account holder.
==========
You should never give out your password or Master Key to another individual or entity.
Ning will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password, Ning ID, Network Subdomain or Master Key, either with or without your knowledge.
However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by Ning or another party due to someone else using your Ning ID, Network Subdomain, Master Key or password.
In other words, please be careful with your identity and passwords.
