Cookies
Innovid may collect the Non-PII noted in this privacy policy using cookies, which are small text files stored on the visitor’s computer.
Visitors can set their browser to reject cookies altogether, to reject Innovid's cookies in particular, or to delete cookies.
An End User of the Services may opt-out of interest-based advertising from Innovid; please refer to the Section entitled “Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising” below.
Innovid's Services
Innovid partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to visitors of third party websites and other online media (such visitors are referred to as “End Users”).
As an End User browses the Internet, he or she may visit Web pages, mobile applications or other online media that make use of the Services.
==========
When this happens, an End User’s browser or device may request advertisements from Innovid's system, and Innovid may collect Non-PII about this interaction, as well as about any further interaction by such End User with the advertisements provided by the Services and the pages or media on which such Services are utilized, such as impressions, clicks, mouse movements, viewing duration, IP address, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, and other Non-PII made available by the browser or device.
In addition, in the event that the data being collected is from a mobile device, Innovid may also collect the mobile advertising ID of the device (e.g. IDFA and Google AdID).
On occasion, Innovid may also receive from third parties Non-PII that enables advertisement optimization, independent of or in combination with the Non-PII collected by Innovid, such as audience interest segments and product categories.
The Non-PII collected by Innovid and/or received from third parties may be shared and used to provide information and reports to advertisers, agencies and publishers who participate in the Services, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity, to administer and enhance the Services and perform internal analysis, and to help Innovid display, optimize, target and/or customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of End Users.
Innovid may use certain general health-related segments received from third parties in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in such topics, such as general health, wellness, common ailments and illnesses, beauty and fitness.
Such health-related segments do not include sensitive health information (such as an End User having a certain medical condition like heart disease or arthritis).
==========
From time to time, advertisements served by Innovid may contain functionality that enables an End User to enter PII into such advertisements or into the landing page to which such advertisements are linked, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding an advertiser or publisher’s product, service, program or other offer.
In the event that an End User elects to provide PII under such circumstances, Innovid may store such information and may share it with the advertiser, agency or publisher on behalf of whom the advertisement was served, and/or with such entity’s service provider.
Innovid may use such information to fulfill or aid in the fulfillment of the End User’s request and/or to auto-populate future requests by the End User’s device.
In cases where the advertisement contains functionality enabling Innovid to store the PII, the End User will have the option to opt-out of the storage of such information by indicating its preference in the appropriate checkbox shown in the advertisement.
The End User should review the advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy to understand how such entity will process the PII entered by the End User.
If you would like Innovid to delete all records of your PII, please send us an email at privacy@innovid.com.
