If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may not provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence.

If you create an account with Blingby, you are agreeing to provide Blingby with certain information, such as your name, phone number, email address, age and other demographic information.
We do not collect social security numbers or any kind of financial account information.
==========
If you access our Services through other social media accounts (for example, Facebook), you should be aware that their respective Application Program Interfaces (“API’s”) provide certain personal information to Blingby (as well as others).
Details regarding that information can be found in the Privacy Policies of these other social media accounts:
•	Facebook
•	Instagram
•	Google+

•	And potentially other channels
We encourage you to examine these policies and explore the options these services provide you with respect to privacy.
==========
Also, as part of your account and profile set-up, you may also optionally provide us with additional information –short bios, favorite locations, artists or videos and a profile picture to name a few.
If you create your Blingby account by connecting through another service (such as Facebook), we may use the public information from that connected account to help complete your Blingby profile.
==========
Either way, you may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time.
Location Information: 
In addition to account and profile information, you may also tell us your location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information.
This information may be collected based on GPS data, or may use other techniques involving cellphone towers or proximity to wifi access points.
==========
Links:  
We may also keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, such as clicking through links on our website, mobile app or embedded in emails sent to you.
We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
Other Site Interactions:
We may keep track of how you interact with other aspects of our Services.
For example, we may keep track of what artists you search for, what products you click on, how many times you view certain videos, where you click on certain images, where you pause and rewind videos, your IP address etc.
We do this to help improve our Services (sometimes with the assistance of third party services), to provide you relevant advertising, to send or stream to you products or offers that we think you may enjoy, etc.
==========
This information is tracked whether or not you have logged in with a Blingby account or logged in through another social media account.
Network, Device and Log Data: 
Our servers automatically record certain information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services.
Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, and search terms.
==========
We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, view videos hosted by Blingby, or interact with our email notifications.
Blingby uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.
Cookies: 
Like many websites, we may use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing public videos.
A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk.
==========
Blingby may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.
Your Privacy Options and Control
Account and Profile Information:
If you have established an account with Blingby, we provide you with certain tools and account settings that allow you to access edit or modify the account and profile information that you provided to us and associated with your account.
Additionally, you have the ability to make certain aspects of your profile information sharable with other users of the Services or availably publically.
You also have the ability to link your Blingby account with other social media accounts.
When you connect your Blingby account to other services, you are able to post your Content to those services as well.
While you can make more of your information private or opt not to provide us certain information, you should be aware that certain features of the Services may not be available to you or may not work in the same way.
For example, you must have a verified phone number attached to your account in order to send a Blingby Message to someone who does not follow you.
Likewise, our Services also include several features to help connect you to the accounts of people you already know.
==========
For example, you may upload information from your address book or connect your Blingby account to your account on another service, such as Twitter.
Blingby will match the information you provide with the contact information of other Blingby users in order to provide and improve the Services, for example by making recommendations and routing Blingby messages.
You may remove address book data from Blingby at any time through the settings in your Blingby app or on the Website; however, by doing so you would not be able to connect to people you know in this way any longer.
You may disconnect your Blingby account from your account on the other services at any time.
Disconnecting your Blingby account will immediately revoke our authorization to cross-post on your behalf or otherwise access that account and we will delete information obtained from that connection (other than information that was publicly posted on Blingby, such as profile information), which may take some time.
You can also permanently delete your Blingby account.
==========
Content, Following, and other Public Information: 
Much of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public.
This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services.
==========
Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated.
For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access Blingby.
When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
==========
Location Information:  
Both IOS and Android, the most popular mobile operating systems, give you the ability to opt-out of passing location information to Blingby; however, certain features of our Service will not work absent that information.
We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.
==========
For example, our “Notify Me” feature needs to know your location in order to provide you with notifications of special offers in your area.
For example, our “Notify Me” feature (which is an opt-in feature of Blingby) sends messages to your mobile phone to alert you to special offers if you are nearby.
Without providing us with location information, you cannot receive “Notify Me” messages.
==========
Other site interactions:  
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.
Currently, Blingby does not use cookies; however, other websites do rely on cookie technology.
If you do not want cookies from any websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
==========
Do Not Track Signals:
Certain web browsers now provide their users with “private” browsing modes and Blingby respects the wishes of visitors that use “private” browsing modes.
Blingby does not take any steps to circumvent “private” browsing; however, you should be aware that “private” browsing modes can differ from browser to browser and we encourage you to refer to your preferred browser for what can and cannot be tracked while in “private” browsing mode.
==========
More about Sharing and Storage of Information.
We use industry best practices to protect the data we receive from you from security breaches and other unauthorized disclosures.
==========
However, we do use and share the information that you provide to us, the information that other social media platforms provide to us and the information we collect through your interactions with our site for several purposes.
We use the information we collect to provide you with Services and to provide you with information about our Services.
For example, we use the contact information that you provide to us to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services.
==========
We may also use this information to stream you advertisements for products, destinations or artists that we think you may enjoy.
We may use this information to connect you with other Blingby users, even if that information is not publicly displayed.
Content that you post and the data provided with the Content (when it was posted, where it was tagged, artists that serve as inspiration, etc.), accounts that you follow, comments that you post and other similar types of interactions on the Services may be broadly and instantly available publicly to a wide range of other users, people who merely browse the Services and other services that access Blingby content.
When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making available for others to see.
==========
Third-Party Services:
We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad.
We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
==========
Blingby uses a variety of third-parties to help provide our Services, including to host our Services, to host various blogs and wikis and to help us understand the use of our Services.
These third-party service providers may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and services, including your IP address, device ID, pages viewed, and links clicked.
Our service providers include Google Analytics and its demographics and interests reporting feature.
==========
Third-Party Usage of Blingby Information:   
Blingby also uses the information that is collected from users to help third parties advertise, market and improve their own products and services.
In some instances, Blingby provides third parties with aggregated data that is not personally identifiable with any particular user.
In other instances more personalized data is provided to third parties so that they can provide you with targeted advertisements for products and services you like, or that they may think that you like.
==========
Additionally, special offers that may be sent to you by way of push notifications can originate with third parties and these special offers may be based on your personal information or may be based on aggregate information.
However, you have the ability to opt out from receiving push notifications.
==========
Law and Harm: 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Blingby’s rights or property.
However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request -- including a government's request -- to disclose your information.
Business Transfers: 
In the event that Blingby is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.
==========
The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information transferred to the new entity.
Changes to this Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.
The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at www.blingby.com/privacy.
==========
If we make a material change (determined in our sole discretion) to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you via an email to the email address associated with your account or through the Services.
By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
Effective: June 1, 2015
