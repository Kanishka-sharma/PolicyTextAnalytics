Given this dual purpose, Business Accounts cannot be closed.
Furthermore, if you use or maintain a Business Account in a manner that contradicts the Terms, Evolution Finance reserves the right to edit or delete information as it sees fit, populate the Business Account and respective Business Content displayed on or through the Services with whatever information that Evolution Finance deems necessary, important and/or fitting to display, and revoke the Business’s permission and ability to edit information directly.
Additionally, even if you forgo control of your Business Account, you should NOT expect your Business Content, listings, information and respective products to be removed from the Services.
It is important to understand that Evolution Finance reserves the right to edit, update and add publically available Content to any Business listing at any time.
If there are any inaccuracies, we will be happy to correct them within 10 business days of receiving your request, which should be submitted here.

==========
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms or the Services or Privacy Policy provided by Evolution Finance shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes and conducted before a single arbitrator.
The place of arbitration shall be Washington, DC.
The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the AAA rules.
Should no AAA rule regarding the selection of the arbitrator be in effect, the parties shall agree on an arbitrator mutually agreeable to both parties.
Should the AAA decline to accept a matter submitted for individual (non-class) arbitration under these Terms of Service, the parties shall jointly select another arbitrator.
In the event the parties are unable to agree on a neutral arbitrator, the claimant may file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction solely for the purpose of requesting the appointment of an arbitrator for individual (non-class) arbitration, as provided for in Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
To begin the arbitration process, a party must make a written demand therefor.
The Terms, and your relationship with Evolution Finance under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction in Delaware.
==========
The agreement to arbitrate shall not be construed as an agreement to the joinder or consolidation of arbitration under this agreement with arbitration of disputes or claims of any non-party, regardless of the nature of the issues or disputes involved.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
Notwithstanding this, you agree that Evolution Finance shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in courts in any jurisdiction.
32.12.
==========
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION YOU MAKE AGAINST EVOLUTION FINANCE ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BOTH PARTIES WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE, BUT BOTH PARTIES BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL.YOU THUS GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS.

YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.
By using the Services provided by Evolution Finance, you consent to these restrictions.
32.13.
==========
The arbitrator’s decision shall become final and binding after 30 days unless a party to the arbitration takes an appeal from the decision by making a written request to AAA.
The appeal panel, which will consist of three arbitrators, will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority.
The appeal panel’s decision shall be final and binding.
32.14.
==========
In the event of a conflict between the applicable arbitration rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall govern.
To the extent that the class action and collective action waivers contained herein are rendered invalid or unenforceable by applicable law as to any Claims, this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to such Claims and thus we may elect to proceed exclusively in court.
If any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement should be found invalid or unenforceable, such a determination shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall remain and continue in full force and effect.
32.15.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NO CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY MAY BE CONSOLIDATED WITH A DISPUTE OF ANY OTHER PERSON IN ARBITRATION, OR RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS BY A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY SUCH COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
32.16.
==========
If any action or proceeding (including arbitration) is commenced to enforce or interpret any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party in any such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees, costs of suit and expenses, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.
As used herein, “prevailing party” includes without limitation, a party who dismisses an action for recovery hereunder in exchange for payment of the sums allegedly due, performance of covenants allegedly breached, or consideration substantially equal to the relief sought in the action.
32.17.

The failure of Evolution Finance to enforce any of its rights or act with respect to a breach of the terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver of any such rights and will not limit Evolution Finance’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
No waiver by Evolution Finance of any of the provisions in the terms will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Evolution Finance.
==========
Evolution Finance may assign its rights and duties under the terms to any party at any time without notice to you.
You may not assign your rights hereunder, and any such assignment shall be void ab initio.
If any provision of the terms is unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable under applicable law, then that provision will be deemed severable from the terms, as applicable, to the extent of such unenforceability and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
==========
The titles contained in the terms are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect.
You agree that the terms will not be construed against Evolution Finance by virtue of having drafted them.
