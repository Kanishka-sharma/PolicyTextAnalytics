Information We Collect Specifically Through Our Ad Network

We may also collect Non-Personally Identifying Information from other sources, such as online data exchanges.
At no time does IDGTN tie this Non-Personally Identifying Information to a particular End User by name, email address or other personally identifying information (“Personally Identifying Information”).
However, browsing activity may be tracked through an anonymous data collection and targeting cookie, as described below.
