We have developed this policy
                because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal

Managing your contact with BT

 Use of personal information
                Because BT's websites contain so much information, we want to help you find what you want
                as quickly and smoothly as possible.
The more we know about you, the easier it is for us
                to help you.
We encourage you to register so that we can give you quicker and better
                access to your favourite services in the future - as well as point you in directions which
                may interest you.
You don't need to register to access most BT websites.
But if you do register, you only
                have to give us a login name and a password.
Additional details concerning your billing
                account and telephone numbers, your e-mail address and other personal details are
                optional, but may be needed if you want to use particular online services, or to customise
                your use of BT websites to suit your individual needs.
When you register, any details you provide will be stored for use on future visits, as we
                do not want you to give us any information more than once.
The details you give us may be
                combined with information about your use of the BT.com website and information from other
                BT records in order to: 
Help you to get more out of your
                    visits to BT.com - by suggesting information, products and services, which will be useful
                    to you personally.
==========
Ensure that the relevant
                    business related information is directed to you within sites such as Insight Interactive.
Save you having to keep giving
                    us the same information for different BT services.
For instance, if you have ever ordered
                    online with BT, certain parts of the order form may be automatically filled in for you in
                    future.
==========
Provide you with on-line
                    services like View My Bill or to change Friends and Family Numbers.
In order to provide
                    these we need your phone number and billing account number for verification purposes.
Keep other parts of BT up to
                    date to offer you products and services that may interest you, by post, telephone contact
                    or e-mail.
If you do not want to receive this sort of information, please go to the
                    section on 'Managing your contacts with BT'.
==========
If you register, we will treat
                you as having consented to our using your personal data in the manner described in this
                Policy.
If you do not register, the personal data we collect from you will be limited to
                that which you give us in order to enter into any transactions on-line.
BT.com will use
                that data in order to facilitate that transaction and for no other purpose.

Email
                addresses
                At BT we respect the privacy of personal e-mail accounts and we store your e-mail
                addresses just as securely as other personal information on BT.com.
We will not send you
                unwanted e-mail messages or junk mail, and your details will not be passed to ANY
                organisation beyond BT without your explicit permission except in cases where they are
                shared with contractors or agents to provide you with the products and services you have
                requested.
However, we will use e-mail to send you messages about outstanding orders, faults and
                service issues.
We may also use e-mail to keep you up to date with news about your current
                services, as well as anything you show an interest in, either online, or through other
                contact with BT.
If you do not want to be kept informed in this way by e-mail, please let
                us know.
You can do this by ticking the relevant box where your email address is stored in
                the BT.com personal profile.

Disclosure
                of information
                BT complies with and is registered under the Data Protection act in the United Kingdom and
                takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data.
BT people and those working for agents or contractors of BT are responsible for keeping
                your information confidential and will only use it to offer products and services on
                behalf of BT.
The details that we use to provide or promote our products and services (for example your
                name, telephone number, or details of the services you use), as well as any information
                collected from you while you are using this web site, will NOT be passed to ANY
                organisation beyond BT to be used for marketing purposes.
Your details may sometimes be
                shared with BT contractors or agents in order to provide you with BT products and services
                you have requested, but we will make this clear to you in the relevant terms and
                conditions we give you when you order.

Right of
                access to your BT information

You can access and change this information at any time by using the ‘update
                profile’ link which appears on various pages after you log in.
==========
If you want to know exactly what personal information BT holds on you, you can obtain it,
                as long as you are a BT customer.
If it transpires that the information held is
                inaccurate, we will make the necessary amendments and confirm to you that these have been
                made.
Please write to the following address, enclosing a cheque for the administration fee
                of £10 made payable to BT plc under the terms of the Data Protection Act.

Security
                We at BT are serious about guarding the security of your personal data and the details of
                any transactions you make.
Your billing account number is a sensitive piece of information, which can be used to find
                out information about your BT services, if it is used with your telephone number.
Please
                be sure to keep this information safe and do not share it with others.
For access to
                information such as itemised billing information and some business account and ordering
                services, extra proof of identity and authorisation may be needed.

How does BT protect your
                data?
When you register details with us, make an order or access account details, we use a
                secure server.
==========
Any data you give us is encrypted using a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL)
                session.
SSL is an industry standard and is one of the best ways to ensure Internet
                messages are not intercepted.
You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use
                SSL.
To be sure, you will need Netscape version 4.05 or Microsoft Internet Explorer
                browsers, version 4 or above.
Over and above what BT do to safeguard your privacy and security, there are a number of
                things you can do to protect yourself from Internet fraud:


Choose a password you can
                    remember but others will not guess, change it regularly, and if you do write it down, keep
                    it somewhere safe and secure.
When you have finished your
                    session on BT.com, make sure that you prevent your details being seen by anyone that you
                    do not wish to see them.
So, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off.
Clear any 'cache' so there is no record of any transactions left on screen - both Netscape
                    and Internet Explorer let you do this.
We also recommend you then close your browser so
                    any history of the session is cleared.
==========
As an extra precaution your session on many BT
                    websites will 'time out' if you have not used the site for 30 minutes.
Use of
                Cookies
                BT websites create a 'cookie' when you first register online.
A 'cookie' is a piece of
                information, like a tag, which some websites create against your PC.
Our 'cookie' stores
                some basic information which helps us to identify if you have visited the site before and
                if you have provide you with some personalised content such as your personal Quicklinks or
                by welcoming you by name if you have supplied this in a previous visit.
However, as it is
                based on your PC, we will not find the 'cookie' if you visit BT.com from a different PC to
                the one you registered on.
BT's use of 'cookies' includes the following assurances: 
No information regarding your
                    telephone number, account or payment details is included in the cookie or can be accessed
                    using it.
They do not collect any
                    information regarding the use of your PC or Internet browsing in any way.
If you do not want a cookie to
                be created on your PC, web browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer provide the
                option to disable them.
Please bear in mind that some personalised services on BT.com may
                not be available if you choose to disable cookies.

                party sites
