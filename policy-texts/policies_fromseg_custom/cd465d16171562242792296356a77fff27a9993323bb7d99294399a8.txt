We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children on our sites and applications.
Some of the features on our sites and applications are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those features.
When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:
Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information
In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children
Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity
Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted
