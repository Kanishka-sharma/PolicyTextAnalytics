At TuneIn's or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the TuneIn Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in the Agreement.
The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party.
The arbitrator's decision and award shall be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator.

The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Agreement and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under the Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages.
