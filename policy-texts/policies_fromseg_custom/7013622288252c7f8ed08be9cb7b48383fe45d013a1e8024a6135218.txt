At Mad Mimi we believe that respecting your recipients is important.
These policies aim to make sending emails effective and receiving emails a joy.
Permission Policy
Mad Mimi is permission based.
That means that the people who receive your emails gave you permission to email somehow, usually by signing up directly or as active customers of yours.
==========
Our Terms of Use conform to Can Spam regulations and more importantly, adhere to the best practices laid out by ISP's.
Sender Responsibility
To send mailings using Mad Mimi, you must follow the guidelines set by the domains you are sending to regarding list management, promotion content, and sending practices.
In order to prevent your mailing from being blocked, throttled, or ending up in the spam folder at recipient email providers, you must take all necessary actions to keep your subscriber list sufficiently responsive, follow the email providers' accepted email coding practices (if you use your own custom email code), and make an effort to avoid sending promotions that are likely to be interpreted by the provider as 'spam.'
If your mailings do not follow these guidelines they may be considered in violation of the Mad Mimi privacy and permission policy.
