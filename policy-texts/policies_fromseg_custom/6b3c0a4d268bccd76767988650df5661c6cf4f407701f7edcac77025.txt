This Government 
            computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, 
            which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors 
            to the different sections of our site, what information is of most 
            and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and 
            identifying system performance or problem areas.
For SITE SECURITY purposes and to ensure 
            that this service remains available to all users, this Government 
            computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic 
            to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, 
            or otherwise cause damage.
Unauthorized modification of any information 
            stored on this system may result in criminal prosecution.
