DATA COLLECTION, RIGHTS AND PUBLISHER PRIVACY POLICIES.
(a) 
    In consideration for Publisher's access to and use of the Services, Publisher agrees that Oracle may set cookies, pixel tabs and/or web beacons
    (collectively, "Cookies") on the Publisher Site(s) where the Services are enabled, and allow its partners to set Cookies that are
    subject to those partners' privacy statements.
When an End User visits a Publisher Site on which the Services are enabled, Oracle may deploy a Cookie to
    record information about how the End User uses the Publisher Site, such as the web search that landed the End User on a particular page or categories of
    the End User's interests.
==========
Oracle may use Publisher Data to target advertising and for other purposes as outlined in the privacy policy toward the End User
    and/or authorize others to do the same.
(b) 
    Certain data protection laws and regulations may impose certain End User consent obligations on Publisher Sites.
Publisher understands and agrees that
    Publisher is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary consents to Oracle placing Cookies on Publisher Site(s) and the device of an End User accessing
    or visiting such Publisher Site(s).
==========
Here is a description of the types of Cookies used by Oracle on the Publisher Site that has the AddThis Tools enabled:


    • Analytics Cookies - When an End User visits a website that has AddThis Tools enabled, Oracle places an analytics Cookie on the End User's device that
    helps Oracle provide insights on End Users activities on a Publisher Site including how frequently End User's device has visited or how the End User's
    device has interacted with the Publisher Site.
• Market Research Cookies - When an End User visits a Publisher Site that has AddThis Tools enabled, Oracle may also place a market research Cookie on End
    User's device, or enable one of Oracle's partners to place a Cookie.
Market research Cookies are similar to analytics Cookies in that they count how
    frequently an End User has visited a Publisher Site, but these Cookies also enable market research companies to evaluate the success of particular
    marketing programs by collecting aggregate data across multiple websites.
• Targeted Advertising Cookies – When an End User visits a Publisher Site that has AddThis Tools enabled, Oracle also places a targeted advertising Cookie
    on End User's device that helps Oracle deliver or enable the delivery of advertising that is customized to End User interests and to keep track of how many
    ads End Users have seen.
For more information, please see AddThis' Privacy Policy.
Oracle strongly encourages Publisher to incorporate the aforementioned Cookie descriptions into Publisher's Cookie consent mechanism and privacy policy
    language as appropriate.
==========
(c) 
    Oracle uses Publisher Data to create commercially viable data products and services that it licenses to its trusted third-party partners (collectively, the
    "Data Products").
Such Data Products include, but are not limited to, non-personal, demographic and behavioral, data segments
    that group End Users with common or shared interests into audience segments that Oracle or its partners have inferred (e.g., travel enthusiast, sports fan)
    based on some or all of the Publisher Data ("Audience Segments") such as demographic, interest, and geographic location data
    derived from an End User's IP address.
Oracle licenses portions of the Publisher Data to its trusted partners for their use in creating Audience Segments
    for online ad targeting and delivery and for other uses such as detection, prevention, and addressing fraud, security or technical issues.
Oracle and its
    trusted partners' use of the Data Products, including its policies regarding health and financial information, are more fully described in its privacy
    policy which can be found at http://www.addthis.com/privacy/privacy-policy.
(d) 
    In addition, Oracle may synchronize anonymous or pseudonymous identifiers (e.g., Cookies) collected above with those of third parties (including
    cross-device identifiers).
==========
Oracle does not retain or provide Personal Information that directly identifies an individual for use in any Audience Segment or
    other Data Products.
(e) 
Oracle Compliance to Rules
    .
Oracle will comply with all Rules directly applicable to Oracle and its provision of the Services to Publisher.
Oracle will post and maintain a privacy
    policy that discloses its practices with respect to the handling of AddThis data and its use of identity persistence mechanisms in creating segments.

    location designated by Oracle) and subject to change at Oracle's discretion ("AddThis Privacy Policy").
==========
Oracle may, as required
    by the Rules or otherwise at its discretion, provide access to, or the ability to correct, modify or delete, any information about or connected to an
    individual, computer or device (including segments or source information).
In the event of any change in the Rules or in the regulatory or self-regulatory
    environment in any applicable jurisdiction, Oracle may, in its discretion, restrict Publishers use of or access to Services in such jurisdiction, without
    liability to Publisher or any third party.
(f)

    (including the collection, use, and transfer of data to Oracle).
Publisher will have an easily accessible privacy policy which will be linked to
    conspicuously from the applicable home page and other relevant pages of the applicable Publisher Sites and/or within the applicable applications.
==========

    links will contain the word "Privacy."
The privacy policy must comply with the requirements of the Rules for notices to End Users whose data is provided to

        information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest
        to you.

Indemnification by Publisher

Publisher will defend at its own expense, from any claim, suit or action against Oracle brought by a third party (each, a "Claim" and

    Publisher's use of the Site, the AddThis Technology or the Services not in conformance with this Terms of Service, including without limitation any use or
    modification of the Downloadable Code, (ii) Publisher's violation of this Terms of Service, (iv) Publisher's violation of any Rules or rights of any other
    person or entity, or (v) any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines input by

(b) 
Procedures
    .
==========
A party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly provide written notice of the Claim to the party
    responsible for indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party").
Failure to timely provide such notice shall not diminish the
    Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligation except to the extent the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend an applicable Claim is materially
    prejudiced by such failure or delay.
The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such information and cooperation as the Indemnifying
    Party may reasonably request at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense.
==========
The Indemnifying Party shall have (i) sole control of the defense and
    settlement of any Claim and (ii) no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under any settlement made without the Indemnifying Party's written
    consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party may not settle any Claim against the Indemnified Party unless such settlement completely and
    forever releases the Indemnified Party with respect thereto or unless the Indemnified Party provides its prior written consent to such settlement.
In any
    Claim or action for which the Indemnifying Party provides defense on behalf of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense
    at its own expense by counsel of its choice.
==========
(c) Infringement Claims.
Upon the occurrence of a Claim for which indemnity is or may be due, or in the event that Oracle believes that such a Claim is likely, Oracle may, at its
    option (i) appropriately modify the Services so that they become non-infringing, or substitute functionally equivalent software or services; (ii) obtain a
    license to the applicable third-party intellectual property rights; or (iii) terminate this Terms of Service on written notice to Publisher.
Publisher
    agrees that Oracle's performance of its obligations under this Section constitute Publisher's exclusive remedy, and Oracle's sole obligation, with respect
    to a third party infringement claim.
