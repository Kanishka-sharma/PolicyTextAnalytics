Protecting
your privacy is a serious matter and doing so is very important to us.
Please read this privacy policy statement
(the "Policy") to learn more about our privacy policy.
This Policy describes the information we
collect from you and what may happen to that information.
==========
This Policy applies to all sites under the
Meetup.com domain.
This Policy does not
apply to the practices of companies that Meetup does not own or control, or to
people that we do not employ or manage.

==========
Information
Collection
 We collect
information about you and your use of our service in order to create a better,
more personalized experience for you.
You must
register with our web site in order for you to be able to fully access our
service.
During registration, you must
provide us with your e-mail address and password and, if you are located within
the United States, your zip code.
==========
In
addition, in order to use any topic group that is available on our site, you
must register for that topic group.
>During registration for a topic group, you may choose a nickname by
which you will be known to other members of that topic group.
If you do not assign yourself a nickname during
registration for a topic group, we will automatically assign you one.
In addition, with respect to each topic
group that you join, we permit you to create and store a short description or
statement which will be viewed by anyone who is accessing that topic
group.
Once you register with Meetup
and sign in to use our service, you are no longer anonymous to Meetup to the
extent you have provided us with this information.
==========
We
automatically track certain basic information about our users.
We use this information to do internal
research on your usage patterns, demographics, interests and general behavior
to better understand and serve you and our community.
This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses,
browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform
type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the
site, track usersÕ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use.
We do
not directly link these types of information (e.g., IP addresses) with your
personally identifiable information.
==========
For
our users convenience, we use "cookies" to allow you to enter your password
less frequently during a session and to provide for an easier registration
process.
A "cookie" is a piece of data
stored on your computer that is tied to information about you.
We do not use cookies for any other purpose
(for example, we do not use cookies to monitor your activities or otherwise
track information about you).
If you configure
your browser or otherwise choose to reject the cookies, you may still use our
site.
However, to best experience our
web site and most easily use our service you must have cookies enabled.
==========
Also,
if you post messages in message areas (including the personal introduction
section of each topic group) on our web site, send us personal correspondence,
or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities
or postings on our web site, we may collect such information and include it in
your profile.
Your profile is not
accessible to other users or third parties other than Meetup personnel.
2.
==========
Use
of Information 
We
use (and you agree that we may so use) the information we collect about you
(including your personally identifiable information) to create a better, more
personalized experience for you based on your individual usage habits, improve
our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve our content
and product offerings, and customize our siteÕs content, layout and
services.
These uses improve our site
and allow us to better customize it to meet your needs.
We also use (and you agree that we may so
use) the information we collect about you to resolve disputes, troubleshoot
problems, and enforce our Terms of Service Agreement.
You
also agree that we may compile the information we collect about you and use it,
in an aggregate form only, in the negotiation and establishment of
service agreements with public and/or private enterprises under which such
enterprises will serve as venues for meetings between our users
("meetups").
You also agree that we may use your
information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases,
are targeted to your interests, such as topic group newsletters or meetup
announcements (which also may include promotional communications),
administrative notices, product or service offerings, and other communications
relevant to your use of our service.
You also agree that we may use for promotional, sales, or any use that we consider appropriate your correspondence with us, be it via e-mail, postings on our web site, or feedback via the user polls.

==========
Disclosure
of Your Information
 
 Except as may be set forth in this section 3,
we DO NOT sell, rent or otherwise share your personally identifiable
information with other third parties.
Instead, to the extent we share information
with our partners and advertisers, we share only aggregated information that is
not linked to your personally identifiable information.
Aggregated information that we may
share with our marketing partners includes, but is not limited to, information
showing the relative popularity of one meetup venue over another (for example,
the number of individuals present at a meetup).
==========
Required
disclosures.
Though we make every
effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose your personal
information when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that such
action is necessary to (a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court
order or legal process served on our web site, (b) enforce this Statement or
the Terms of Service Agreement, (c) respond to claims that your Personal
Information violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights,
property or personal safety of Meetup, its users and the public.
You
authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other
government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual
property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or
you to legal liability.
==========
Venue
providers; Advertisers.
We
aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in
a non-personally identifiable manner to (1) public and/or private
enterprises who may or do serve as venues for meetups in order to enable us to
negotiate and establish service agreements with such enterprises under which
the enterprises will serve as venues for meetups, and (2) to other third
parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes.
However, in these situations we do not
disclose to these third parties any information that could be used to identify
you personally (for example, we never disclose your e-mail address to such
third parties).
Business
transitions.
In the event that
Meetup goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by
another company, or selling a portion of its assets, usersÕ personal
information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
==========
Users will be notified via e-mail and/or
prominent notice on our web site for at least fifteen (15) days prior to a
change of ownership or control of their personal information.
If as a result of the business transition,
the usersÕ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner
different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choices
consistent with Section 8 ("Notification of Changes").

Communications from Us
 We will send you a welcoming e-mail
to verify your e-mail address.

>These notifications may include promotional communications.
You may not opt-out of these communications
while you are a member of that topic group, but you may end your membership in
that group at any time.

related announcement.

communications, though you can deactivate your account.
However, these communications are not
promotional in nature.

Security
 Meetup uses
industry standard network security practices to safeguard the confidentiality
of your personal information.

retention of the information is necessary to resolve disputes, troubleshoot
