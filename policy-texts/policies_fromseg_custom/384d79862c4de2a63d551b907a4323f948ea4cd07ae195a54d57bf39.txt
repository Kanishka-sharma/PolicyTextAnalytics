Describe your request with sufficient details to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
==========
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.

Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
In case of rejection, the response we provide will explain the reasons for which we cannot comply with your request.

If you provide an authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code §§ 4000–4465, it may not be necessary to perform these steps and we will respond to any request from such authorized agent in accordance with the CCPA.
==========
Do Not Track Signals
Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other “Do Not Track” (“DNT“) mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site.
==========
Children privacy
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the minimum age for providing consent in the jurisdiction they reside in (“Age of Consent“) or knowingly allow such persons to register as Customers.
By accessing or using our Platform, you certify to us that you are at the Age of Consent.
In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the Age of Consent without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information upon discovery.
If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the Age of Consent, then please contact us at support@ex.co.
==========
Information collected by third parties
Some of our third party partners may obtain Personal Information from you if you voluntarily submit such information.
We are not responsible for any information collected by such third parties, or their privacy practices.
Therefore, you should always review their privacy practices carefully before providing Personal Information to such third parties.
==========
When you make purchases through our Platform, we process your payments through a third-party payment processor.
In these instances, the third party application may collect certain Personal and Financial Information from you to process a payment on behalf of EX.CO, including your name, email address, address, credit card number and other billing information in which case the use and storage of your personal and financial information is governed by the third party application’s terms and condition and privacy policy.
==========
Retention
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide our Services.
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.
Retention periods shall be determined taking into account the type of information that is collected and the purpose for which it is collected for, bearing in mind the requirements applicable to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused information at the earliest reasonable time.
==========
Protecting your information
We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of your Personal Information.
Your EX.CO Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
You need to help us prevent unauthorized access to your EX.CO Account by protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your account by signing off after you have finished accessing your EX.CO Account.
You will be solely responsible for keeping your password confidential and for all use of your password and your EX.CO Account, including any unauthorized use.
While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept confidential, we cannot guarantee the security of any information.
==========
You should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet and that there is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.
As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your Personal Information or other content you transmit using the Platform, and you do so at your own risk.
==========
Thus, we encourage you to exercise discretion regarding the Personal Information you choose to disclose.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, so please re-visit this page frequently.
We will provide notice of substantial changes of this Privacy Policy on the Platform or we will send you an e-mail regarding such changes to the e-mail address that you volunteered.
Such substantial changes will take effect seven (7) days after such notice was provided on any of the above-mentioned methods.
Otherwise, all other changes to this Privacy Policy are effective as of the stated “Last Revised” date, and your continued use of the Platform after the Last Revised date will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.
