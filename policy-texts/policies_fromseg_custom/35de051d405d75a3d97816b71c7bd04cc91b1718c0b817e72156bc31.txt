We are not able to list every specific recipient in this Privacy Policy due to the volume of recipients and frequency of changes to this information.
The categories of recipients are explained in more detail in the sub paragraphs of this section above, for example, travel suppliers such as hotels, airlines, car rental companies and activity providers, who enable us to fulfil your booking.

If you have any questions about third-party data sharing, please contact us at the information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
On occasion, we share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.
For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations.

This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope will be of interest to our users.
How do we use your information?
==========
Our legal bases for processing personal information (EEA visitors only) If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
We will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
In some cases, we will have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you such as where it is necessary to use your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
==========
We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
How do we determine what our Legitimate Business Interests are?
==========
We carry out an assessment to ensure that: (i) Our interest in the use of your data is legitimate (i.e., we have a clear business need); and (ii) The business need, on balance, does not override your privacy rights.
When determining this, we assess the potential impact a specific use of the data may have on you as a customer and weigh this against our own business needs to ensure that we get the balance right.
We also apply a series of security measures to minimise any potential risks.
==========
By way of example in practice we would consider that the collection of our customersâ€™ marketing preferences in the course of a booking is a legitimate business interest to have as an online ecommerce company.
We believe that this does not unduly impact your privacy rights as you may want to hear about our products and services going forward.
However, to protect your privacy rights we ensure that you can opt out of these promotional communications at any time, in your account, in the email itself or through customer services.
In accordance with the legal grounds above, we use the information we collect to:
