Privacy Initiatives




Advances in computer technology have made it possible for
      detailed information about people to be compiled and shared more easily and cheaply than
      ever.
That's good for society as a whole and individual consumers.
==========
For example, it is
      easier for law enforcement to track down criminals, for banks to prevent fraud, and for
      consumers to learn about new products and services, allowing them to make better-informed
      purchasing decisions.
At the same time, as personal information becomes more accessible,
      each of us - companies, associations, government agencies, and consumers - must take
      precautions to protect against the misuse of that information.
The Federal Trade Commission is educating consumers and
      businesses about the importance of personal information privacy.
Read more about our
      efforts, what we've learned, and what you can do to protect the privacy of your personal
      information.
