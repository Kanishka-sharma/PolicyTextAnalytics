What Information is Collected
User Provided Information
Bandsintown Group does not collect any Personal Information, such as name, address or e-mail address, on its web sites without the knowledge and consent of the individual submitting such information.
However, when a user uses the Service via their cellular phone or other wireless device, Bandsintown Group may have access to the user’s wireless device number and other account information.
Personal Information is collected from users through such users’ activities, transactions, completion of online forms on the Service (such as registration forms), games and contests and through voluntary online questionnaires that may appear from time to time on the Service.
Depending upon the Service, Personal Information may also be provided to us by, for example, your wireless service provider (hereinafter “Wireless Carrier”) or a third party platform, such as iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Last.fm, Pandora, etc (hereinafter “Third Party Platforms”).
Personal Information collected in the course of your use of the Service is further described in the Terms of Service Agreement.
“Personal Information” includes, for example, name; home and/or business address or other address (like a school address); e-mail address; telephone, wireless and/or fax number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; demographic information and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.
We may also ask you to provide other information about yourself such as your age, hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc.
Access to certain content, functionality and features of the Service may require you to add settings that provide additional information, such as your geographic location, specifications, network access connection, messages and other device-specific information.
You may review and ask that we correct or delete the Personal Information that you have provided to the Service by e-mailing privacy_group@bandsintown.com  or writing to Bandsintown Group at 215 Lexington Avenue, 18th Fl., New York, NY 10016 ATTN: Legal and Business Affairs Department.
==========
We will send you a copy of such Personal Information we have on file in your user account (if any).
You may send us new or updated information at any time.
You may be able to send information to your friends and family members and/or other contacts and social networks through the Service by clicking on your Facebook wall or status, a “Share”, “Like”, “Email”, “Recommend”, “Twitter” or similar button on the Service or, in a message that we have sent you, or by utilizing a particular feature of the Service designed for such purpose.
In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our message on your own or circumvent the designated and permitted feature of a particular Service and send independent or unauthorized messages or correspondence), you may provide the name and e-mail, SMS or other address of your friend, family member or other contact to us.
You may also be able to send an online card to a friend or family member, or send them a gift or gift certificate or other similar feature.
If so, you may be required to provide us with your friend’s or family member’s Personal Information.
Such information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
It is your responsibility to make sure that your friend or family member consents to this.
==========
Usage Information
Any or all of the following activities with regard to Usage Information may be performed by us or on our behalf by our service providers, including, without limitation, Wireless Carriers, aggregators, Third Party Platforms and ad serving networks.
Cookies and Other Locally Shared Objects
We try to provide you with services, products and offers customized to your interests.
In order to do that, we may use “cookies” and “locally shared objects” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.
==========
Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your computer or device from a server and stored on your computer’s or device’s hard drive or memory.
Locally shared objects are also files that are stored on your computer or device using a media player that is installed on your computer or devices (such as a Flash player) or using HTML5 (or similar computer language), which is the language that your computer or device uses to communicate with our servers.
Cookies and locally shared objects do not gather any Personal Information about you; they simply track where you travel on the Service and what you look at.
(Cookies and locally shared objects may, however, store your login name, which allows you access to our online forums and other features and services.)
==========
In doing so, they may enable Bandsintown Group to relate your use of the Service to Personal Information that has already been submitted.
Many other service providers use cookies and locally shared objects for very similar purposes.
We use cookies and locally shared objects to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; assist in processing items in your shopping basket; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which areas of the Service you have visited.
We may also match information obtained from cookies and locally shared objects with data provided by you or collected by third parties.
We analyze this data both in the aggregate and in connection with individual users.
This information lets us give you the services you want that are connected with your interests.
==========
We also may provide the analysis of our users (as a group, of course) to prospective business partners, advertisers and other third parties.
You may occasionally get cookies and “locally shared objects” from our advertisers.
These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties’ policies.
Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.
==========
Similarly, most media players that enable locally shared objects can be set to manage them.
For example, Adobe’s Flash player allows you to manage locally shared objects (also known as “Flash cookies”) through its Flash Player Settings Manager.
You may be able to control the use of HTML5 locally shared objects by reducing the amount of space you allow for them through your Web Browser’s settings.
Refusing a cookie or locally shared object will generally not interfere with your use of our web sites.
==========
However, refusal may, in some cases, preclude you from using some or all of the features related to the Service.
Clear GIFs
We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies to help track usage of the Service.
Clear GIFs allow Bandsintown Group and our service providers and business partners to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use, for example, for future service development and to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
We may also use clear GIFs within the context of certain emails to determine the effectiveness of the mailing.
A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.
==========
IP Address and Clickstream Data
Our server automatically collects data about your server’s Internet address when you visit us.
This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider.
Similarly, when you access the Service via a mobile device, our server automatically collects data about the unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device (“UDID”).
When you request pages from the Service, our servers may log your IP Address or UDID.
Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web or mobile site or a search engine); the pages you visit on the Service; the web or mobile site you visit after the Service; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of browser, computer, device, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on the Service or a referral site; and other usage activity and data logged by our servers.
==========
We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to administer the Service.
Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.
We may also link this information with your Personal Information.
Our servers cannot automatically record your name or e-mail address, but in some cases they may receive such information from Third Party Platforms and third party application or providers, if you are a registered member of the platform or service.

By using the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and agree that you are giving us your consent to collect your Personal Information submitted and automatically track your activities and your use of the Service as described in this Privacy Policy.
Third Party Offers
When registering on the Service, Bandsintown Group may provide you an opportunity to receive offers from advertisers and other companies or individuals who have services, products, information and/or offers that we think might be of interest to you.
If you do not at that time indicate a preference not to receive such information or offers, Bandsintown Group may from time to time provide your contact information to these entities so that they may send you these offers.
If you no longer want us to share your contact information with others, follow the instructions set forth in the Right to Opt Out section above.
==========
Co-Sponsored Services and Offerings
Some of our services and other offerings may be co-sponsored by another company.
If you provide information to Bandsintown Group (or if we otherwise collect it as described herein) in connection with a co-sponsored service or offering, the information you provide will be used for the purpose for which you provided the information and may be shared with that co-sponsor partner.
Your Personal Information may also be used for other purposes that may be disclosed at the time your information is requested or which are reasonably necessary to provide the service or other products or services requested by you in accordance with our respective privacy policies.
If you wish to opt-out of a co-sponsor partner’s future use of your Personal Information for marketing or other purposes, you will need to contact the co-sponsor partner directly.
Please note that the use of such information by the co-sponsor partner is subject to the co-sponsor partner’s privacy policy.
==========
Aggregate Statistics
Bandsintown Group reserves the right to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in and use of our services and electronic communications, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.
Bandsintown Group may disclose such analyses to advertisers or other third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.
Social Media
When you contribute to a public area or social media feature of the Service, such as a blog, wiki, list serve, chat room, bulleting board or other communication or community tool or area, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public.
For this reason, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable other users to locate you, or financial information on these areas of the Service.
Instead, make up a username that does not disclose your personal identity.
==========
When you comment or click “Like” or “Dislike” on content on using Facebook or another social network via the Service, your comment or “Like” or “Dislike” opinion will be displayed on the Service and also on you own social networking profile, and it will be viewable by anyone who is able to view your social networking profile depending on the privacy settings you have set in your social networking account.
Depending on how you have set the privacy settings, your posing may also be broadcasted to other users of the social network via the Service.
The privacy policies of your social network service also apply to the information you provide using these features.
When you participate in our user community activities on Third Party Platforms the information you submit will be received and used by such Third Party Platforms, pursuant to their privacy policies and will also be received by Bandsintown Group for its use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
