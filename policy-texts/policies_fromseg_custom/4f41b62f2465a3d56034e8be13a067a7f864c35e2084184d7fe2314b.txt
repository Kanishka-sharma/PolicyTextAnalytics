Blis Media Limited is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
Blis is making changes to the way we operate to ensure compliance under the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework.
?
We have updated our privacy policy to provide clearer and more precise language about how we collect, use and share personal data.
?
==========
Blis values the consumers right to privacy.
Our objective is to ensure that the consumer always feels in control of where and how their personal information is collected, stored and used.
?
==========
We always honour consumer privacy preferences for opting their data in for any purpose.
This policy applies to Blis Media Limited, its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Blis,” “we,” “our” or “us”), and describes how we collect, use, share and secure your personal data and device-related information.
It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal data.
?
==========
Blis Media Limited is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act”) under number ZA113120.
Blis is a registered member of the Information Commissioner’s Office the government’s body which will adjudicate on the GDPR in the UK.
?
==========
We are a global company, and operate in multiple jurisdictions concerning privacy and data protection.
We are committed to complying with local regulations, including with the GDPR in the EU.
?
==========
Many of the rights provided by the GDPR are upheld by Blis globally as good practice, unless they conflict with regulations or practices in other jurisdictions.
For example, the data subject rights provided by the GDPR are available to users worldwide, not just within the EU.
?
==========
Please read this policy carefully to understand how we treat your information.
This policy is intended to inform you of how our technology processes information on behalf of consumers, advertisers, publishers and other businesses that use our website, products and services.
By providing personal data to us, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy.
?
==========
About our businessBlis is a digital advertising company.
We provide services to companies including media agencies and their clients—global advertisers—who may purchase media or data by using our technologies, or who may share data with us.
Our services (“Services”) may include, for instance, verifying location data, measuring footfall attribution, facilitating advertising based on audience segments and inferred interests, cross-device retargeting, and other attribution and location analytics.
?
We use the information that we receive from our partners, including publishers and supply side platforms (“SSPs”), demand side platforms (“DSPs”), data management platforms (“DMPs”), telco Internet service providers (“ISPs”), beacon providers, data providers and others (together, “Partners”), or which we collect ourselves through our website and in the course of the provision of our services, to engage in targeted advertising, including location-based advertising and related data services.
?
==========
This means that we partner with third-party websites and mobile application (“App”) publishers to enrich or serve ads within their sites and mobile Apps that are customized to their users.
We do this by inferring interests and locations from information we are passed or collect about how those users interact with sites and Apps that have partnered with us.
?
==========
The overall result is that the consumer receives advertising which is more specifically tailored to his or her interests, and the advertiser reaches an audience which is more interested in its products or services.
Accurate targeted advertising is, therefore, a win-win situation for advertiser and consumer.
As noted below, consumers have choices with respect whether to allow targeted advertising on a device-by-device basis, and we honor those preferences.
?
==========
Information collected and used via our servicesWe do not collect or receive from our Partners information which directly identifies individuals (such as names, addresses, phone numbers or email addresses), and so we do not identify an end user’s actual real-world identity via our technology.
However, some of the data which we process (such as device ID numbers, IP addresses and location data) are considered as “personal data” for the purposes of some data protection legislation, and so it is therefore our policy to treat the data which we process in the provision of our Services as “personal data” in accordance with the requirements of applicable local laws and regulations.
?
==========
We do not collect directly identifiable personal information (“PII”) from users online through advertisements we serve or manage on behalf of our clients unless users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in a text field for example.
PII here refers to directly identifying information such as an individual’s name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.
If you affirmatively and deliberately provide PII via an advertisement that we serve then we will use the information only for the intended purpose, and if you provide PII via one of our client’s advertisements who was identified to you at the time of collection, then that PII will be provided to such client, and such PII shall be subject to that client’s privacy policy.
?
==========
As we do not have a direct relationship with the consumers whose data we receive from Partners or third parties and process on their behalf, we rely on our Partners to ensure that the data that it has passed to us has been lawfully obtained and use has explicitly consent, that the consumers have been given notice as to how their personal data will be processed and that it may be passed to intermediaries such as Blis, for example, for the purposes of targeted advertising, and that the consumer has consented to such information sharing and processing.
Accordingly, each publisher, website, Partner or developer is responsible for obtaining all applicable consents to enable our targeted advertising and other services.
Where possible, and specifically in the EU, that consent is explicitly passed to us with the personal data, and we will check it before using the personal data.
We handle various types of data in the provision of our services, including the following:�?
==========
Information relating to devices that we receive from our second and third party Partners, which, depending on the user’s chosen device permissions, may include the device ID of the mobile device being used to access an App (for example, IDFA on iOS or GAID on Android, which are random strings of letters and numbers generated by the software of the device and which do not include any directly identifying details of the device’s user), precise geolocation data, Wi-Fi IP addresses, demographic data including age, gender or country, physical beacon data, and the name of the publisher or App in use.
Blis does not receive device ID’s from web browsers – device IDs are received in respect of App traffic only.
Much of our device tracking comes from advertising bid requests and information associated with device IDs in bid requests.Other information from advertising bid requests relating to a particular device ID, such as hashed cookie IDs or proprietary client/Partner IDs, user agent information, latitude/longitude and historic location data, device make, model and operating system, ads clicked on, frequency of exposure to ads served, IP address, and timezone.
For IP addresses that we have identified as residential, we may link devices seen at the IP address as being potentially in the same household, for instance, in jurisdictions that allow that linking (the EU does not).
We may also receive anonymized IDs based on, e.g., SSP-deployed cookies, which may have been synced with other third-party cookies, and that are de-identified and shared with us.Information which we receive from ISPs, in a small percentage of cases, which includes anonymised demographic data such as age or gender of users of the ISP’s network.
==========
We only receive this information where the user has accepted the ISP’s terms of use and/or privacy policy, and has opted in to the data being provided to us and used for targeted demographic and location-based advertising and, where required by the jurisdiction, that explicit consent has been passed to us.On a website or mobile App, user behaviour within the website or App, and data regarding the general nature of the content being viewed, such as the category of the site or App (e.g., sports, shopping or travel related), as well as opted-in data such as device location services.
We also collect information via a software development kit (SDK) that App developers may include within their App to tell the App to collection location data, provided the user has expressly provided the App to collect location information and, where required by the jurisdiction, passed that consent on to us.By way of example, our algorithms help our clients to determine which ad to serve to a particular device based on multiple factors including the real time location of the user, whether we have a history of location data for the same device ID, and the ads previously served to that device ID.
?
We retain such data used for targeted advertising as needed to carry out the purpose for which it was collected, or until an individual expresses an opt-out preference, whichever is the shorter, but for no longer than 12 months in any case.
?
==========
Blis uses the information it collects and receives to:Analyse the effectiveness of online and mobile advertising campaigns;Attribute user interests to browsers and devices;Measure footfall traffic and ad campaign conversion attributions;Identify relationships between different browsers and devices, as well as between Wi-Fi IP addresses and the locations of various points of interest;Deliver targeted advertising campaigns across devices; andCreate audience segments and profiles, which may be based on factors such as shopping interests, age, gender, geography and/or online actions.To find out more about Online Behavioural Advertising, please go to:�?
