Section I - Rocket Fuel Advertising Services
Our Consumer Mission
At Rocket Fuel, we want to turn online ads from an annoyance into a useful complement to your online experience.
We want to deliver personalized, well-chosen ads to help you discover things that interest you—new websites, new products, new bargains.
And we want to be the Rocket Fuel for the web that powers this discovery.
We use lots of rocket science to pick the best ads to show, based on everything we know about the context: the ad itself, the page that needs an ad, the time of day and other external factors, and you.
How We Think of You
Before describing the kinds of data we collect, it's important to understand how we (and most other ad networks) identify you and other web surfers and online users.
We have no idea who you are.
We place an anonymous identifier in a cookie on your web browser, so to us you are just "surfer82" for example.
==========
We don't request or store anything that is personally-identifiable information (PII).
We don't know your name, address, phone number, or email address.
We prohibit our partners from sharing this information with us, and we require that they also either not collect PII, or, if they do, that they not merge PII with anonymous data they share with us.
The Information We Collect
When you visit the website or mobile application (“app”) of entities for which we serve advertisements, or the websites or apps where we display advertisements, we collect information about your online activities and location in order to show you relevant advertising.
==========
To learn about the ads you might like or dislike, we may ask you questions directly—for example, we might ask about which ads, products, or brands you like or dislike.
We may collect information about our interactions with you, such as which ads we've shown you and on which pages and how you responded to them.
We may collect information about our partners' interactions with you—for example, by placing pixels on an advertiser's webpage so we can know if you ultimately purchased an item they had advertised with us.
==========
We may partner with other companies that are permitted to share anonymous information with us in order to enhance audience profiles.
For example, we may partner with companies to learn the kinds of products you like to buy online.
We also collect information about your device, such as IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type and language, the server your computer is logged into, and operating system information.
==========
We remember this information for up to 30 months.
How We Use that Information
Seeing all this information allows us to find historical patterns that help us select better ads in the future.
For example, we might learn that an ad for mp3 downloads works better on users who've previously clicked ads for mp3 players, or we might learn that a coffee ad works better in the morning.
==========
Our system will test millions of possibilities along these lines and build a giant formula to predict future responses.
We make inferences from the data we collect in order to show you advertisements for products or services that we think may interest you.
As an example, we may use health-related segments such as "Frequent Buyers > Health & Wellness Buyers" (Click here for a complete health segment list.)
==========
We also use the information we collect to measure the effectiveness of ads on behalf of our advertisers and web publishers.
If we can make ads more useful and interesting for you, we'll also make you more valuable to the web—your visits will make websites more money per ad, and powering their investment in better products and more free features and content.
We'll also make the web more valuable to advertisers, helping them make more money on their online campaigns, which will cause them to shift more advertising online, which will support even more websites with even more useful content and features.
It's a virtuous cycle we're happy to be part of, and we hope you're equally happy with your role in this endeavor.
But if you're not, you may learn more about opting out of personalized advertisements in Section III below under “Opting Out of Personalized Advertisements.”
