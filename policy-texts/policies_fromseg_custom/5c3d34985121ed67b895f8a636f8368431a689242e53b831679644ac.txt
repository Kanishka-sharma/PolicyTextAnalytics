About Criteo’s services 
Criteo specializes in creating personalized advertisements.
We work with online partners to build advertisements for users who visit their website or mobile applications and with publishers to display personalized advertisements.
Our aim is to deliver advertisements by displaying products and/or personalized banners that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing behavior.
For example, if you visit and browse on Website/mobile application A, on a subsequent online visit to Website/mobile application B, you will see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website/mobile application A.
With our service, you should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Criteo.

Our Technology
Dynamic Retargeting                                                    
We collect information via tracking cookies placed on your browser or advertising IDs in environments that do not support cookies like mobile applications.
Thanks to these technologies, Criteo “tags” visitors to its partners’ websites and mobile applications.
Users tagged by Criteo are given a technical identifier.
At no point does Criteo collect identifying personal data such as your name or address.
Criteo only analyses the products viewed by the visitor and pages visited of the partner for whom Criteo is delivering ads.
Our partners’ advertisements are displayed on many websites, also known as “publishers.”
==========
These publishers may also place cookies on your browser.
These cookies are there so that the publishers recognize that Criteo has a personalized advertisement available for your browser.
Their use are governed by the specific privacy policies of the publishers which can be accessed directly from their websites.
==========
Cross-device Linking
To serve you our personalized advertisements and provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on the different browsers and environments you are using (“ID syncing”).
Thanks to its ID-syncing technology, Criteo is able to serve you the most relevant ads disregarding the device or browser you are currently using without collecting or processing any identifying personal data such as your name or address to operate the linking.
For this purpose, Criteo uses exact linking methods by leveraging the technical data collected through our technology such as our advertising partner’s identifiers or email hash that they may pass to us.
We may also receive ID-syncing information from trusted partners using diverse linking methods for the same purpose and with the same level of guarantees in terms of Privacy and Data Protection.
See “data collection and use” paragraph to learn more.

Data Collection and Use
We do not know who you are.
We only collect and use technical data relating to your browsing navigation to display personalized advertisements.
We collect browsing information
Data collected on Criteo network
To serve relevant ads, we have to be able to single out patterns but we never willingly store data that would allow identification of a person (such as name, surname, phone number, address, etc.).
We collect data related to your browsing activity through cookies or advertising IDs that record:
-          events related to your activity on our advertising partner’s website (such as the number of pages viewed, the products you viewed on that website, your searches made on the partner’s website)
-          information related to your device (device type, operating system, version)
-          and events related to the Criteo ad serving activity such as the number of ads displayed to you.
We also collect technical user identifiers from our advertising partners for the purpose of linking the different browsers and mobile apps you use and serve you relevant ads based on your behaviour across environments (“ID syncing”).
For that purpose we process and store
Technical IDs of our advertising partners, and/or a hashed version of your CRM ID or of your email address – we use a double hashing method based on state-of-the art technologies to ensure the non-reversibility of your information.
A hash of your email correspond to a series of characters that does not permit your identification.
For eg : a hash of name@mail.com would be 98307a5ba02fa1072b8792f743bd8b5151360556b8e5a6120fa9a04ae02c88c0 
Mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple IDFA or Google AAID) which are specific technical data created by mobile manufacturers to allow personalization and customer analytics in a secure and non-identifying way for users
Data collected from trusted partners
We can collect technical identifiers from third parties for the purpose of improving our ID syncing and be sure to offer you a seamless online experience.
==========
These trusted partners commit to only share ID syncing information allowing us to link users’ cookies and/or mobile identifiers and to provide an efficient choice mechanism to end-users (opt-out).
For eg : the linking information sourced from our partners could be Cookie ID ABC = Apple IDFA 123 = MD5 hashed value).
Our partners may use probabilistic or deterministic methods but in all cases please note that beside the ID syncing information, no other data (whether personally identifying information or non-personal identifying information) that could be collected by our partners in the course of their services are shared with us.
Moreover, we require that all our partners provide users with a simple way to opt out from the collection and use of their data.
