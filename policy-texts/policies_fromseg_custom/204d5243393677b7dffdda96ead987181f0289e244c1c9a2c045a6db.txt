CMP TERMS OF SERVICE
Last Updated: 
May 30, 2006

1.
Acceptance of Terms
CMP Media LLC and its affiliates CME LLC, CMP
Healthcare Media LLC, and CMP Healthcare Media
Group LLC, Shorecliff Holdings LLC and CMP-Cybermedia LLC (collectively, "we" or "CMP")
provide our Internet sites and the content,
products and services offered on or through
those sites (collectively, the "Services"),
to you subject to the following Terms of Service
("TOS").
Your use of the Services in
whole or in part constitutes your binding acceptance
of these TOS.
If you do not agree to these
TOS, you should not use the Services.
==========
Some
Services may be subject to additional posted
rules, policies and terms.
When you use those
Services, you and CMP shall be subject to
those additional conditions, which are incorporated
by reference into these TOS (and, consequently,
form part of your agreement with us).
Other
Services may be governed by different usage
terms (for example, different usage terms
apply to users of our Gamasutra Internet
site).
In the event of an inconsistency between
these TOS and any additional posted conditions
or separate usage terms, the provisions of
the additional conditions and/or separate
usage terms shall control.
==========
Because
we may modify all or any part of these TOS
from time to time without notice to you,
you should check back often so you are aware
of your current rights and responsibilities.
Your continued use of a given Service after
changes to the TOS have been published on
that Service constitutes your binding acceptance
of the updated TOS.
If at any time the TOS
are no longer acceptable to you, you should
immediately cease all use of the Services.
2.
==========
Description of Services
The Services include a combination of content
that we create and that other third party
content suppliers create.
In addition, some
Services provide you and other users with
an opportunity to submit, post, display,
transmit and/or exchange information, ideas,
opinions, photographs, images, video, creative
works or other information, messages, transmissions
or material to us or others on or through
that Service (collectively, the "Postings").
We
adhere to high journalistic standards, and
use every reasonable effort to provide informative
and relevant content as part of the Services.
However, in using the Services, you may be
exposed to content that you find offensive,
indecent, objectionable or that is inaccurate
and you bear all risks associated with using that content.
You understand
that the Services are provided by CMP "AS IS", as further described
in Section 15 of these TOS, and that CMP does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity
or quality of any content available on or through the Services.
In this regard,
you acknowledge that you may not rely on any of this content, whether created
by or submitted to CMP, including, but not limited to, product reviews, white
papers, product descriptions, stock quotes, or Postings on any bulletin board,
chat, news group, community, forum or other feedback section of the Services
(collectively, the "Forums").
==========
You
understand that from time to time, you may
communicate with, receive communications
from, or otherwise participate in or use
the services or obtain goods and services
of or from, third parties (e.g., advertisers)
as a result of your use of the Services.
All such communication, interaction and participation
is strictly and solely between you and such
third party and CMP shall not be responsible
or liable to you in any way in connection
with these activities or transactions (including, but not limited to,
any representations, warranties, covenants,
contracts or other terms or conditions that
may exist between you and the third party,
or any goods or services you may purchase
or obtain from any third party).
In particular,
the appearance or availability of links to
third party sites on or through the Services
does not constitute an endorsement by CMP
with respect to the content, advertising,
products, or other materials available on
or from such sites.
You further understand
and agree that the Services may include certain
communications from CMP (such as administrative
messages and certain newsletters), and that these communications are
considered part of the Service and you may
not be able to opt out of receiving them.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new
features that augment or enhance the current
Services shall be subject to the TOS.
==========
Finally,
you are responsible for obtaining access
to the Services and that access may involve
third party fees (such as Internet service
provider or airtime charges).
You are responsible
for those fees, including those fees associated
with the display or delivery of advertisements.
In addition, you must provide and are responsible
for all equipment necessary to access the
Services.

perform and display materials containing the same; and 
incorporate the Postings
and the Image in other works in any form, media or technology now known
or later developed throughout the universe, and reproduce, publish, display
and otherwise distribute the same.

affiliates permission to copy your Postings and the Image as part of the normal
backup process and/or to archive discussions containing your Postings and/or
the Image.5.

information, such as your name or email address, in connection with
a Forum, the information may be collected and used by others.

to be available to other Service users, you should not include it
