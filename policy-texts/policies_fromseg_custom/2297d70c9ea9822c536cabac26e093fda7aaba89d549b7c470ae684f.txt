FAQ
What's in the WHOIS directory?
The WHOIS directory is a searchable list of every single domain name registered in the world, including the names, addresses and other details of the people who own them.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires accredited registrars to publish this information in the WHOIS listing as soon as the domain is registered.
So everyone can see my information?
==========
The short answer is yes.
The name, address and phone number you submit when you register your domain is publicly accessible by anyone at any time.
==========
This may be good news if you have a domain name you'd like to sell.
Or it may be bad news if your name and contact info is collected by a spammer, hacker or cyber-criminal.
What about my business?
==========
I want people to find me.
Privacy and Business Protection includes a "virtual business card" designed to drive traffic to your website and increase the reach of your existing efforts without sacrificing your privacy.
How does Privacy Protection work?
==========
Instead of displaying your personal information in the WHOIS database for all to see, our partner Domains By Proxy will replace it with its own.
The domain will belong to you - except now, you and Domains By Proxy® will be the only ones who know it.
==========
What is Privacy & Business Protection?
Privacy & Business Protection includes all the features of Privacy Protection, plus Domain Ownership Protection and Website Security Basic.
