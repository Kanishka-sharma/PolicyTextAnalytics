Jivox may collect three (3) types of information about you: Personal, Financial and Non-Personal.
"Personal Information."
Personal Information refers to information that lets Jivox know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address).
Jivox may collect Personal Information when you use the Jivox Properties including, without limitation, setting up account information, filling out surveys, corresponding with Jivox, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.

All such Financial Information is used only for billing purposes.
==========
"Non-Personal Information."
Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations).

HOW JIVOX COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION
Any Personal Information submitted to Jivox will be sent to and stored in servers located at our Internet Data Service Provider.
The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all Jivox's customers worldwide.

Prior to using one or more of the Jivox Properties, Jivox may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account ("Account") or to enable features or functionality of the Jivox Properties.
Failure to provide all required information required by Jivox may prevent access to any or all Jivox Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all Jivox Properties.
Information Collected Through Technology.
While you are able to visit the Jivox Site and remain anonymous, Jivox or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Jivox Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider).

IP Address.
You may visit many areas of the Jivox Site anonymously without the need to become a registered User.
Even in such cases, Jivox may collect IP addresses automatically.
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin service with an Internet service provider.
Each time you access the Jivox Site and each time you request one of Jivox's pages, the server logs your IP address.

Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in Web pages and e-mails.
Jivox may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that Jivox sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.
The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.
==========
Tracking Content Usage.
If you use the Jivox Services and you post audio-visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, video, pictures, or sound (collectively, "Content") to your Web site or to a third party Web site, Jivox tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User Accounts and the use of Content.

Additionally, upon request, Jivox will delete Personal or Financial Information from the database where such information is stored; however, it may be impossible to entirely delete a User's entry without some residual information being retained due to the manner in which data backups are maintained.
Requests to delete Personal or Financial Information will be submitted to admin@jivox.com>.
==========
E. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES
Jivox will not sell, trade, rent or distribute Personal or Financial Information collected through the Jivox Properties to any third party without your prior consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jivox will disclose any information to any third party if Jivox determines, in its sole discretion, that: (1) the law requires it or a  law enforcement agency has requested it; (2) it is necessary to enforce Jivox's terms of use or any agreement governing the Jivox Properties; or (3) it is necessary to protect the rights, property, safety or security of Jivox, our content providers or the public.
F. SAFEGUARDING YOUR INFORMATION

Security Measures.
==========
Jivox protects your Personal and Financial Information using state-of the-art technologies, including the following:
Secure Socket Layer.
Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encrypted communication is used to protect all Personal and Financial Information.
SSL is a standard format for transmitting secure data from your computer to Jivox's servers.
SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL connection.
You will know SSL is being used when you see "https" preceding a Web address, rather than "http."
==========
Additionally, to protect your Personal and Financial Information, Jivox restricts employee access to databases containing Personal and Financial Information, imposes confidentiality requirements upon employees who do have access to databases containing Personal and Financial Information, and binds subcontractors with contractual, technical and organizational measures.
In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and billing may be handled by third party financial institutions, which may only use your Personal and Financial Information in connection with the business services they perform for Jivox and not for their own benefit or otherwise.
All information they receive is via SSL.
Although Jivox uses reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your Personal and Financial Information, transmissions made on or through the Internet are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure.
In addition, submissions made via e-mail are not protected by SSL technology and are vulnerable to interception during transmission.
You hereby acknowledge that Jivox is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and release Jivox from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information.
==========
Third Party Links.
The Jivox Properties may contain links to third parties who may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information directly from you.
Additionally, Jivox may use third parties to provide components of the Jivox Properties.
In either case, such third parties may have separate privacy policies and data collection practices, independent of Jivox.
Jivox: (a) has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions; (b) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites; and (c) does not make any warranties or representations about the contents, products or services offered on such Web sites or the security of any information you provide to them.
G. Changes to Jivox's Privacy Policy
Jivox continually strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect you, your privacy and your use of the Jivox Properties.
As a result, Jivox may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.
In no event will these changes result in the degradation of any of the security measures designed to protect you from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this Privacy Policy.
==========
H. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE
Use of the Jivox Properties is not intended for minors under the age of 18 ("Minors").
Minors are not authorized by Jivox to use the Jivox Properties, even if Minors set up an Account or accept the terms of any agreement for Jivox Properties.
Parents or guardians may authorize Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 to use the Jivox Properties, provided they assume all responsibility and legal liability for the conduct of such Minor including, without limitation, monitoring the Minor's access and use of the Jivox Properties.
==========
Jivox does not intentionally collect nor maintain any personally identifiable information from Minors.
If you discover your Minor child has submitted his or her information to Jivox, you may request to have such information deleted from Jivox's database by sending an e-mail request to admin@jivox.com together with the e-mail address that was submitted by the Minor.
Upon receiving the request, Jivox will use reasonable efforts to delete such information.
==========
If Jivox learns that a Minor is using the Jivox Properties, Jivox will require verified parental or guardian consent, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA").
