About Eventbrite:


Welcome to Eventbrite.
Eventbrite, Inc. ("Company", "we", "us" and/or "our") enables people all over the world to plan, promote, and sell tickets to any event.
And we make it easy for everyone to discover events, and to share the events they are attending with the people they know.
==========
We do this through our websites and domains, the services available on or through our websites and domains or otherwise provided by us, and the software available on or through our websites and domains or otherwise provided by us (including our mobile applications such as At The Door®, Entry Manager and the Eventbrite® app) (collectively, the "Services").
Our Cookie Policy:


This Cookie Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable information ("Personal Data"), that is collected from users of and/or visitors to the Services (including through those users' and visitors' agents) ("you" or "your"), through cookies, pixel tags, local shared objects, web storage and other similar technologies.
Please also refer to our Privacy Policy, into which this Cookie Policy is incorporated by reference, which sets forth our policy with respect to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage of information, including Personal Data, that is collected from users of and/or visitors to the Services.

Consent:


By using the Services, you are consenting to the use of the technologies described in this Cookie Policy to collect both Personal Data and non Personal Data and to the storage of information on your device or web browser as described herein.
What are cookies, pixel tags (aka clear GIFs or web beacons), local shared objects and web storage?
Cookies

            A cookie is a piece of information that is placed on your web browser when you access and/or use the Services that stores text and which can later be read back by the Services or third parties.
They are used to recognize your browser.
Pixel Tags (aka Clear GIFs or Web Beacons)
        

            A pixel tag is a tiny invisible tag or graphic placed on certain parts of the Services, in emails or in certain other downloadable content, but not on your computer, mobile device or browser.
Local Shared Objects (aka Flash Cookies)
        

            A local shared object is similar to a cookie, except it is stored on your computer or mobile device, instead of your browser, and it can store more than just text.
The methods for controlling local shared objects are different than the methods for controlling cookies (as discussed below).
Web Storage (aka HTML5 Local Storage)
        

            Web storage methods are similar to cookies but can store more information than cookies and usually store that information on a persistent basis.
==========
How can I manage these technologies?
Cookies

            Cookies may be session cookies (i.e., last only for one browser session) or persistent cookies (i.e., continue in your browser until they are affirmatively deleted).
You can manage cookies through your web browser's option settings and through those settings you may be able (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies, (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies.
Please refer to your web browser's help section for information on how to do this.
Pixel Tags

            Pixel tags do not store information on your computer, mobile device or browser (although they are occasionally downloaded to your computer if contained in an email or other downloadable content) so cannot be managed by you.
==========
Local Shared Objects

            Local shared objects are stored on your computer or mobile device.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for local shared objects, click here.
Web Storage

            Web Storage, or HTML5 Local Storage, is an industry-standard data storage technology that is implemented by browser manufacturers.
Refer to your browser's help contents for procedures on how to manage settings for Web Storage.
==========
What do you use these technologies for?
Generally we use these technologies for one of the following reasons:



Essential (strictly necessary)

            We use these technologies in a way that is essential for the operation of our Services or parts thereof.
For example, we may use cookies to determine where to route your traffic to effectively distribute the workload across numerous computers.
Performance/Analytics

            We use these technologies to analyze how you use our Services and to monitor our Services.
==========
For example, we may place cookies that allow us (i) to measure the time of your requests to our servers and our responses, (ii) to A/B test new features, (iii) to record statistics about site usage, (iv) to track your activities on the Services, and (v) to track the places from which you come to the Services.
Functionality

            We use these technologies to allow us to provide certain functionality on the Services and to remember your preferences.
For instance, when you click the "remember me" box on our log in page we place a persistent cookie on your browser that allows our Services to pre-populate your email address when you return.
Other examples include remembering your preferences (such as language and location preferences), preventing web application vulnerabilities, allowing for Facebook Connect and other third party integrations, and in connection with providing search results.
==========
Advertising

            We use these technologies to deliver advertisements to you both on and off the Services.
By using these technologies we hope to better tailor these advertisements to your interests.
Sometimes this is called online behavioral or interest based advertising.
Some (but not all) of the third party services that we use in this context participate in industry bodies that allow you to opt out of such use.
As of the date hereof, we use technologies from Google, Bing/Yahoo, Perfect Audience, Retargeter and Qualtrics for such purposes.
==========
If you are a resident of the US, click here to manage your opt-outs for those third party service providers who participate in such opt-out frameworks.
If you are a resident of the EU, click here to manage your opt-outs for those third party service providers who participate in such opt-out frameworks.
Does anybody else use these technologies on your Services?
Most of the cookies and other technologies described above on our Services are set by us (aka first party cookies) or are used in connection with the Services and set by third party service providers at our direction ("Third Party Cookies").
We may use Third Party Cookies with respect to each of the uses set forth above.
For example, we use technologies from Google Analytics to measure performance/analytics and technologies from Facebook to provide Facebook Connect functionality.
Occasionally, a third party such as an Eventbrite organizer may use these technologies on their event pages for their own purposes.
