This Privacy Policy governs the use and collection of information from you by Belo Corp. and its affiliated companies (collectively, "Belo," "we" or "us") through your use of Web sites, interactive services and mobile applications that display an authorized link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services").
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us offline or through any means other than the Services.
For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide when you subscribe by postal mail or telephone to one of our stations or to information that you provide to us at a live event or when you respond by postal mail or telephone to a survey or an invitation to enter a sweepstakes or contest.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices.
By using any of our Services, you agree that your use, and any dispute over our privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.
Understanding that technologies are rapidly evolving, we reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time.
Any such changes will be promptly posted on this page, with an updated "effective date" posted at the beginning and/or end of this policy.

How we use your personal information 
With whom we share your personal information

What Types of Information Do We Collect?
==========
The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information (for example, your name, e-mail address and mailing address) that you voluntarily supply when you register, initiate transactions, or communicate with us, and (2) information collected automatically as you navigate within our Services, or read our e-mail newsletters.
In some cases, it is a vendor or service provider of ours that collects the information on our behalf.
Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our Services also may be gathering the same kinds of information through processes that we don't control subject to their own separate privacy policies.
Registration and Other Personal Information
When we use the term "Personal Information" in this policy, we are referring only to information that uniquely identifies a specific individual, such as an individual's name, phone number, mailing address, or e-mail address, and information about an individual's activity or characteristics that is directly linked to personally-identifying information.
We may ask you for Personal Information when you register for or use various aspects of our Services, including when you order products, complete a survey, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or report a problem with our Services.
We may also collect contact information for other individuals when you use the sharing tools available within our Services to share content or offers with your friends and associates.
We use this information to facilitate the communications you request.
Please note that if you use any "send-to-friend" features of our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
==========
Aggregated Information
Much of the information we collect is compiled in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Services, and the habits and preferences of our audience.
Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally and does not constitute "Personal Information" under this policy.
We may use aggregated information or other anonymous information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.
Information We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Services
Belo or third-party vendors and service providers acting on our behalf may collect certain information automatically when you use our Services, including:

Your browser type, browser identifiers, language, plug-ins, Internet domain and operating system;
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with you online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;
The site you visited before visiting a Belo Service and the site you visited after leaving our Service;
Content and advertisements you view and links you click on while navigating within our Services;
Unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law;
Information collected through cookies, scripts, web beacons and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below);
Information about your interactions with our video content, such as the type of content viewed on our Services;
Information about your interactions with our e-mail messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message; and
Standard server log information.
==========
Precise Location-Based Information
With your consent, we  may also collect information about the exact real-time location of mobile devices you use to access our Services.
We use this information to provide you the content and location services you request, such as location-based weather reports and traffic maps, tell you about offers we think you will value based on your location, enable you to submit user-generated content based on your location, and otherwise improve your experience using our Services.
You are not required to consent to our collection of precise location-based information to use our Services and you can adjust the settings of your mobile device to turn on and off our access to your precise location information.
==========
What Are Cookies, Scripts and Web Beacons and Why Do We Use Them?
What are Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored within your browser.
Cookies are accessed and recorded by the Web sites you visit, and by the companies that deliver the advertisements you see on Web sites, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online.
We use cookies for the following general purposes:

To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while you visited one of our Web sites.
For example, if you register for a Belo Service, we may save your username and password, so you do not have to re-enter them each time you visit.
==========
To help control the display of advertisements and customize the content and advertisements you see while using our Services.
To help us measure and analyze visitor traffic and usage patterns and to improve the quality and effectiveness of our content, features, advertisements, and other communications.
Third-party companies that provide some of the tools and features accessible through our Services and advertisers and other companies involved in the delivery of the advertisements that you see while using our Services also may place cookies within your browser.
==========
We do not have access to these cookies and do not control how they may be used.
You can set your browser to accept or reject most cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set.
(Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)
==========
It is up to you whether to allow us or third parties to send you or to set cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some of the features of our Services.
Please note that certain browsers cannot be used to block or delete so-called "Flash" cookies, which use a feature of the Adobe Flash video player to store information on your computer.
For information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe Web site here.
Web Beacons, Scripts,  and Other Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers and other third-party companies involved in the delivery of advertisements you see on our Services and/or while visiting other unaffiliated  Web sites may use scripts, web beacons and/or similar technologies, to collect information about your use of our Services.
==========
Web beacons (sometimes called "transparent GIFs," "clear GIFs," or "pixel tags") embed a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an e-mail.
When your browser downloads a web beacon, the server that sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and a description of that page.
We use web beacons to improve your experience using our Services, including to provide you with content, advertising and offers customized to your interests, and to understand whether our users read e-mail messages and access links contained within those messages.
==========
How Do We Use Your Personal Information?
We believe we can enhance your experience on our Services with the information you share with us.
We use Personal Information to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Service usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the content, layout, and features of the Services.
We will use your Personal Information to respond to your comments and questions.
==========
We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, phone number or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that we think may be of interest to you, including products and services of third parties, unless you have elected not to receive these promotions and offers by modifying your profile as described below in "How Can You Opt-Out of Sharing Your Personal Information or Receiving Our Promotional Communications?"
We may match Personal Information we collect through our Services with other information about you supplied by third parties so that we can provide you with customized product, services, and content offerings that we believe will interest you and to otherwise improve our advertising and marketing efforts.
After registering on one of our Services, you may receive communications including mail, e-mail, telephone or wireless text messages from us related to products and services that we believe will interest you.
Although we hope you find these communications informative and useful, you can opt-out from receiving these types of communications from us by changing the privacy preferences in your member profile or by deleting your profile from our database.

With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?
Our Affiliated Companies
We may share any information, including Personal Information, that we collect through the Services with any company that is directly or indirectly owned, controlled or operated by Belo so that we and they can communicate with you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.
The use and further disclosure of the information collected on our Services by our affiliated companies will be governed by this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.
==========
Vendors, Service Providers and Provider Partners
We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third-party vendors and service providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services, that assist us with the operation and development of our Services.
We reserve the right to share with these companies any information we collect provided that they commit not to use Personal Information collected from our users for any purpose unrelated to the services that they provide for us or our users.
To make our Services more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features of our Services in conjunction with other unaffiliated companies ("Provider Partners") that specialize in operating such features.
For example, we may offer a car buying service, personalized finance and weather information services, social networking tools, sweepstakes offers or other promotions through cooperative arrangements with Provider Partners.
We share with our Provider Partners such information, including Personal Information, as is useful or necessary for them to provide you with the feature that they offer through our cooperative arrangement with them.
Some of these Provider Partners may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the service.
Their use of such information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their Web sites or obtain by contacting the Provider Partners directly.
Please refer to "Who is the Party Collecting Your Personal Information?"
for additional information.
Other Disclosures
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this policy or within our Services, we reserve the right to release Personal Information about our users when we deem such release to be appropriate to comply with law, respond to compulsory process or law enforcement requests, enforce our Terms of Service, or protect the rights, property or safety of our users, the public, Belo, our affiliates, or any third party.
==========
Over time, we may reorganize or transfer various assets and lines of business.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein or within our Services, we reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we collect to third parties in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, foreclosure, liquidation, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of Belo or our affiliates.

Our Services may operate as part of a larger group of sites and applications and may carry co-branded pages.
In addition, other third-party sites or applications may use Belo's name, or the name of one of Belo's affiliated companies or Services.
Since Belo does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies, if any, of such third parties, and Belo shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your Personal Information by such parties.
Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.
