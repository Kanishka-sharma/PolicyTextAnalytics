Personal
    Information

"Personal Information," as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.
Personal Information also includes information, such as demographic information (e.g., date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences), when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.
==========
Personal Information does not include "aggregate" or other non-personally identifiable information.
Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.
We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes at our sole discretion and without notice or liability to you.
Collection of Information
Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information
We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Services.
==========
These include the following:  


E-mail Newsletters.
We may offer e-mail newsletters from time to time on our Services.
If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.
==========
User Accounts and Profiles.
Our Services may give you the ability to register for an account or to create and update a user profile.
If we offer user account or profile functionality on the Services, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering for an account or creating or updating a user account or profile.
This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you.
We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional.
==========
Logging into Networks.
Certain networks using our Services may require users to establish or use login credentials.
In connection with supporting this log-on functionality, we may collect information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, or user or administrator-created usernames, along with user-created or administrator-created passwords, to facilitate such log-on functionality and otherwise to provide our Services.
Correspondence.
If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Services, or by other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.
==========
Contests and Sweepstakes.
We and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Services or otherwise.
Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners.
In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us.
The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such personal information.
==========
Testimonials.
We display testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements.
With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.
==========
Information Related to Data Collected for our Customers.
Meraki collects information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.
If you are an individual who makes use of services offered by one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact the customer that you interact with directly.
==========
We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services.
Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.
Passive Information Collection
When you use or visit our Services, some information is collected automatically.
For example, when you access our Services, we automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Services (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), identifiers for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Services, the actions you take on our Services, and the content, features, and activities that you access and engage with on our Services.
==========
We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages from Meraki, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”).
We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, maintain and improve our Services and our other services and systems and to provide content that is tailored to you.
If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy.
==========
Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.
Please be aware that in the course of your use of the Services, websites or other services provided by third parties ("Third-Party Services"), including marketing or website optimization vendors, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their Third-Party Services or other services or content.
To do this, they may use first-party cookies (which are set by the same domain your browser is receiving data from) or third-party cookies (which are set by a different domain).
Meraki also may make non-personally identifiable information available to Third-Party Services, and these Third-Party Services may collect such information, to assist such parties in understanding our users’ activities and usage patterns on the Services.
If desired, you may use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to opt-out of having information collected by Google Analytics.
We do not have access to, or control over, the actions of Third-Party Services.
Each provider of Third-Party Services uses information that it collects in accordance with its own privacy and security policies.
Additionally, please be aware that Google and other third-party vendors may place or recognize one or more unique cookies on your computer when you use the Services, and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on our Services and on third-party websites and other Third-Party Services.
Google and these other third-party vendors may use information about those activities to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements.
In particular, we may use Google and other third-party vendors to engage in “remarketing,” in which advertisements you see on third-party websites and services may be based on your prior visits to our Services.
To learn more about these practices, and to opt-out from Google’s and other vendors’ use of information collected on the Services through cookies for advertising purposes, you may visit Google’s Ads Preferences Manager, TRUSTe's Preference Manager, or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
Please note that opting-out will not prevent advertisements from being served to you on the Internet; it will only result in advertisements that utilize cookies to serve advertisements on the specified advertising networks from which you opt-out no longer being targeted.
We are not responsible for the activities of other parties that may not comply with your opt-out requests.
We also use Google Conversion Tracking, which tracks whether users engage in certain activities (e.g., filling out a form to receive more information about our products or services) after they view one of our advertisements on a Third-Party Service.
Google uses cookies to track conversions and to report that information to us.
==========
Finally, please also be aware that we use the Google Maps API as a source of maps, geographic data, and geolocation information for purposes of providing location-based information regarding terminal devices connected to networks managed by our Services and for providing related reporting and analysis.
Google may collect information, including personal information, from those who view content provided through the Google Maps API, and Google handles such information in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.
Network Usage Information Collected by Our Services
Some of our Services collect information from terminal devices connected to networks that are managed by those Services.
Those Services also collect information regarding the performance of, and certain other information regarding, such networks.
This information includes, for example, MAC address, device type, operating system, geolocation information, and network traffic information (e.g., hostnames, protocols, port numbers, and IP addresses).
This information is made available to administrators of networks managed by our Services through an online interface that we call the “dashboard”.
Additionally, if a Meraki customer elects to use our device management tool currently known as Systems Manager ("Systems Manager") and installs its software on, or configures the profile of, a mobile device or other device (e.g., a laptop computer) managed by Systems Manager, the customer or Meraki may undertake certain actions on the device, such as the following: (i) list, access, copy, move, and delete files; (ii) track and record device location over time; (iii) take and record screenshots; (iv) manage the device through remote desktop functionality; (v) set and enforce policies; and (vi) install/remove apps.
Finally, for devices with Systems Manager installed or devices that utilize Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, we transmit certain geolocation information about those devices and the network(s) on which they are running to Google, which provides us with related geolocation information that we store and make available to network administrators through our dashboard as described above in this paragraph.
==========
Google handles the information that we provide to it in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.
Information from Other Sources
We may receive information about you, including Personal Information, from affiliated and unaffiliated third parties, and may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you in order to ensure we have accurate information.
If we do so, this Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.
Use of Information
We use Personal Information and other information we collect to do any of the following: provide services to our customers; provide information and otherwise respond to your requests, including sales inquiries, email requests, and shipping requests; enhance, improve, operate, maintain, and debug the Website, our other Services, and our other programs, services, Web sites, and systems; improve the effectiveness of our Website as a marketing tool and optimize the performance of the Website and our other Services; prevent fraudulent use of our Services and other systems; to prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in violation of the Meraki End Customer Agreement, the Meraki Terms of Use, or applicable law; to tailor content and other aspects of your experience on and in connection with the Services; maintain a record of our dealings with you; for other administrative purposes; and for any other purposes that we may disclose to you at the point at which we request your Personal Information, and pursuant to your consent.

These third parties may use such Personal Information and other information that we disclose to them for purposes such as marketing our products and services to you.

Additionally, if we offer user account functionality on the Services, we may allow you to view and modify settings relating to the nature and frequency of promotional communications that you receive from us.

Once we receive your opt-out request, we will no longer disclose your Personal Information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes.
Please be aware that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures of Personal Information or other information made for non-direct marketing purposes.
==========

If we offer the ability to create user accounts or profiles on our Services, you may have the ability to access and update certain categories of Personal Information that you provide to us by logging in to your account and accessing your account settings.
If you wish to access, amend, or delete any other Personal Information we hold about you, you may contact us at privacy@meraki.com.

==========
Please note that we may need to retain some of your Personal Information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
Please note that Meraki has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process on behalf of our customers.
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to our customer (the data controller).

We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customer.
Meraki will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
==========
Links
The Services may contain links to other Web sites or other Third-Party Services that we do not own or operate.
If you choose to visit or use any Third-Party Services or products or services available on or through such Third-Party Services, please be aware that this Policy will not apply to your activities or any information you disclose while using those Third-Party Services or any products or services available on or through such Third-Party Services.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third-Party Services or any products or services on or through them.

Children’s safety is important to us, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active interest in the online activities of their children.
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent.

==========
International Visitors
Many of our servers and data centers are located in the United States.
If you choose to use the Services from outside the U.S., then you should know that you may be transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into the U.S. for storage and processing.
By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Service, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services.
You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.
==========
Security
We use certain security measures in an effort to protect Personal Information from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction.
The security of your Personal Information and our customers’ information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
==========
Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us.
You transmit information to us at your own risk.
==========
If Meraki learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
Meraki may post a notice through the Services if a security breach occurs.
Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
To receive a free written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at privacy@meraki.com.

If we change this Policy in a manner that materially alters your rights or obligations under this Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.
==========
For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made.
We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information.
Your continued use of the Services after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of this Policy.

ARTICLE 6    TERM AND TERMINATION
6.1.
Term.
==========
This Agreement will be effective with respect to your use of the Products until the expiration of the License(s) applicable to the Products you are using, unless earlier terminated under Section 6.2.
To the extent that you purchase additional Hosted Software License(s) subsequent to the date of the first Order, the duration of each Hosted Software License you have purchased will be adjusted such that all of your Hosted Software Licenses terminate on the same date.
The new co-termination date is calculated as a function of (i) the remaining time on your existing Hosted Software License(s) at the time of purchase, (ii) the duration of the Hosted Software License(s) purchased, and (iii) the one-year list price of each such Hosted Software License.
This function produces a time value attributable to each Hosted Software License purchased that, when added together with the time value attributable to all new Hosted Software Licenses in a given purchase, yields what we call the “Incremental Dollar Days” associated with the new purchase.
In addition, based on the one-year list price of all Hosted Software Licenses in your Network and the number of each type of Hosted Software License purchased, we determine the amount of Hosted Software License value that your Network consumes each day, what we call the “Daily License Usage Rate.”
By dividing the Incremental Dollar Days by the Daily License Usage Rate, and adding the resulting number of days to the remaining time on your existing Hosted Software Licenses we arrive at the adjusted co-termination date following any new purchase.
For further information regarding our licensing and co-termination policies please visit http://meraki.cisco.com/support#policies:licensing.
6.2.
==========
Termination.
Either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason effective upon 30 days prior written notice.
Meraki may immediately suspend your use of the Products at any time if Meraki reasonably believes that you have breached the terms of ARTICLE 3, ARTICLE 4, or Sections 5.4 or 9.1.
If such breach by you remains uncured for five days following receipt of notice from Meraki, then Meraki may terminate this Agreement effective immediately.
You may terminate this Agreement for cause if we breach any material obligation of ours under this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within 10 business days of our receipt of written notice from you of such breach.
If Meraki terminates this Agreement for convenience, or if you terminate this Agreement for cause, then in either case you will receive a refund of the amount you paid for the Hosted Software License allocable to the remaining Term.
6.3.
==========
Effect of Termination.
Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, your access to and right to use the Products will terminate, and all Licenses will terminate.
Upon expiration of a Hosted Software License, your Apps License will survive and you may continue to access and use the Web Apps and Mobile Apps, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Upon termination of this Agreement, each party will return (or destroy) any Confidential Information of the other party in its possession.
The following provisions of this Agreement will survive any termination of the Agreement: Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.3, 7.5, 7.6, and ARTICLE 9.

Service Warranties.

7.3.
==========
Hardware Warranties.
We represent and warrant to you, the individual or entity who obtained the Hardware from Meraki or its authorized reseller, but not to any End Users or other third parties, as follows: (i) for the Warranty Period the Hardware will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship; (ii) all items of Hardware are new or refurbished unless otherwise indicated on the face of the Order; and (iii) we have good title to the Hardware, free and clear of any liens, claims, or encumbrances.
Hardware not meeting the warranties set forth above will be, at our option, (a) repaired, (b) replaced, or (c) Meraki will refund to you the depreciated amount of the Purchase Price allocable to the defective Hardware, calculated on a straight-line, five-year basis.
All Hardware repaired or replaced under warranty will be warranted for the remainder of the Warranty Period.
For any return permitted under Meraki’s then-current return policy as (available at http://meraki.cisco.com/support/#policies:return), you will request a Return Materials Authorization ("RMA") number in writing with the reasons for the return request.
==========
The remedies described above are our sole liability and your sole remedy for any breach of the warranties contained in this Section 7.3.
Meraki is not responsible for any non-Meraki data or information stored on any Hardware returned to Meraki for repair, whether under warranty or not.

Exclusions.
Meraki has no obligation with respect to defects caused by or resulting from any of the following: (i) installation or use of third party software on or in the Hardware; (ii) modifications or repairs to the Hardware or Software made by you or any third party; (iii) damage or defects resulting from misuse, accident, neglect, abuse, failure of electrical power, adverse environmental conditions, unusual electrical or physical stress, catastrophe, negligence, improper storage, testing, or connection, or other improper treatment; (iv) your use or operation of the Hardware or Software other than as detailed in the Specifications; (v) misconfiguration of the Hardware or Software; or (vi) any other causes beyond Meraki’s reasonable control.
7.5.
==========
Disclaimer of Warranties.
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, MERAKI DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE, AND CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.”
MERAKI MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCTS WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT USE OF THE PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; NOR DOES MERAKI MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY MEANS OF THE PRODUCTS, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS IN THE PRODUCTS WILL BE CORRECTED.
==========
FURTHER, MERAKI DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PRODUCTS OR THE MERAKI SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
MERAKI ALSO ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO, OR VIRUSES THAT MAY INFECT, CUSTOMER’S HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, OR OTHER MATERIALS.
Because some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion of implied warranties, portions of this section may not apply to Customer.
7.6.
==========
Exclusion and Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT WILL MERAKI OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE PRODUCTS OR USE OF THE PRODUCTS THROUGH CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT BY ANYONE ELSE, EVEN IF MERAKI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IN NO EVENT WILL MERAKI’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER AND ANYONE WHO USES THE SERVICE THROUGH CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT, FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER ANY THEORY OF LAW OR EQUITY, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE ACROSS ALL ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CUSTOMER.
==========
CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT THESE LIMITATIONS OF MERAKI’S AND MERAKI’S SUPPLIERS’ AND DISTRIBUTORS’ LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.
The provisions of this Section 7.6 allocate risks under this Agreement between Meraki and Customer.
Meraki’s pricing of the Products reflects this allocation of risks and limitation of liability.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to Customer, in which case Meraki’s liabilities will be limited to the maximum extent allowed by law.
ARTICLE 8    INDEMNITY
Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold Meraki, its affiliates, and their employees, officers, directors, successors, assigns, agents, and customers harmless from and against any and all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees arising out of or in connection with any and all claims, demands, actions, or proceedings brought by a third party to the extent based upon: (i) any grossly negligent, reckless, or intentionally wrongful act of Customer or Customer’s assistants, employees, agents, or End Users; (ii) Customer’s or its End Users’ misuse of the Products or breach of this Agreement; or (iii) Customer’s unauthorized modification or alteration of the Hardware or Software, including any modification or alteration in violation of Sections 3.6 and 4.2, above; (iv) Customer’s combination of the Hardware or Software with other products, software, or services not supplied or specified by Meraki; and (v) Customer’s continued use of the Hardware or Software without implementation within a reasonable time period of modifications provided by Meraki.

The Receiving Party agrees to limit access to the Confidential Information to those of its employees or contractors as are reasonably required for the purpose of performing the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the deployment, operation, and maintenance of the Products.

If Receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, Receiving Party will provide Disclosing Party prompt written notice, if legally permissible, and will use its best efforts to assist Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order or another appropriate remedy.
9.2.
==========
Entire Agreement.
This Agreement, the Order, and the Service Level Agreement (collectively, the "Governing Documents") constitute the entire agreement between Meraki and Customer with respect to the subject matter of the Governing Documents and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, and arrangements, oral or written, between Meraki and Customer.

9.3.
==========
Force Majeure.
Neither you nor Meraki will be liable under this Agreement by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations (except for payment obligations) on account of strikes (other than strikes of a party’s own employees), shortages, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental action, labor conditions (other than with respect to a party’s own employees), earthquakes, material shortages or any other causes that are beyond the reasonable control of such party so long as the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts, including the implementation of business continuity measures, to mitigate the effects of such force majeure.
9.4.
==========
