For Consumers:
Watchdog Complaints

We encourage you to use TRUSTe’s Watchdog Dispute Resolution process to report and resolve privacy complaints you may have concerning TRUSTe Sealholders or to report misuse of TRUSTe trademarks.
If you choose to file a Watchdog complaint about a TRUSTe Sealholder, we require that you provide your name, email address, city, state, country, postal code, name of the Web site, URL, and a description of the privacy issue you are reporting.
Any additional personal information you provide on the Watchdog Complaint Form is optional; we will use the information you provide to investigate your complaint and to send you a Watchdog Customer Satisfaction Survey once your complaint is resolved.
We encourage you to complete the survey; whether you do so or not is entirely up to you.
==========
We will not share your name or email address with the TRUSTe Sealholder that is the subject of your privacy complaint, or anyone else outside TRUSTe, unless you give us explicit permission to do so.
Please be aware, however, that if you do not permit us to share your name and email address, our ability to successfully resolve your complaint may be limited.
If you are a resident of a European Union Member State, and your Watchdog complaint concerns the offline information practices of a TRUSTe EU Safe Harbor Program Sealholder, you have two other options for filing your complaint: you may fax your complaint to us at (415) 520-3420, or mail it to TRUSTe Watchdog Program, 55 2nd Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105.
==========
We will use the personal information you provide in the manner described above for all Watchdog Complaints.
We post information about Watchdog Complaints on our “For Consumers” page on a monthly basis, but only in aggregated form (i.e., without identifying individual complainants).
==========
Consumer Opinion Surveys

We occasionally conduct online consumer surveys to learn about your views on important privacy issues.
We do not collect personally identifying information in these surveys.
We use the survey data to improve our programs and services, and may publicize the results as a public service.

For Businesses:

Sign-Up for TRUSTe Programs and Services

If you apply to become a TRUSTe Web Seal Program Sealholder through our online Certification Center, we will use the personally identifying information you provide there (e.g., your name, address, email address and company information) to follow up with you about your application and to assist you in the certification process.
If you use our “Invite Participants” function to provide us the name and email address of a colleague who will assist you in completing your application, we will use that information only for the purpose of sending your colleague a user name and password to access your application.
If your company is certified as a TRUSTe Web Seal Program Sealholder, we will use the information in your application to provide you ongoing TRUSTe support and to communicate regularly with you.
==========
From time to time we will also offer you the opportunity to receive information about privacy-related products or services offered by our third-party partners.
We will not share your personally identifying information with these third parties, other than service providers, unless we have your explicit permission to do so.
==========
We will use information submitted through our online Certification Center to analyze the characteristics of our Sealholders, in order to improve our services to them.
We will occasionally provide aggregated statistics about our Sealholders in reports made available to them, to third parties, or to the general public.
These reports will not identify individual TRUSTe Sealholders.

 Cookies

A “cookie” is a small text file that a Web site can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it easier to use certain site functions.
The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer.

If you want to know when this happens, or prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a Web site attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer.
We use cookies on our Web sites in the following ways:

When you complete a Watchdog Consumer Satisfaction Survey or respond to other surveys that TRUSTe posts from time to time, we use a cookie to make it easier for you to use the survey form, and to ensure that we do not receive duplicate survey responses from any one respondent.
When you apply for certification as a TRUSTe Web Seal Program Sealholder in our Certification Center, we use a cookie to enable you to navigate easily through the application process.
==========
We also use cookies to analyze how visitors, in the aggregate, use our Sites, in order to make our Sites as useful as possible for them.
We do not use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information.
Web Site Analytics
We use a third party Web analytics service provider that uses cookies and Web beacons to help us analyze how users use this Web site and the effectiveness of our marketing search terms.

They will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Web site and compiling aggregated reports for us.
The information collected by our service provider and provided to us is not personally identifiable.
