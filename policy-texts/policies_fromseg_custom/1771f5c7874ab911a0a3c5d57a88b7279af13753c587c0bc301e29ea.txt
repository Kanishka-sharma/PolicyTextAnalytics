Confidentiality
“Confidential Information” of either party will mean information disclosed to or learned by the receiving party concerning the disclosing party’s business, customers, products, proposed products, plans, inventions, processes and techniques, which is designated as “Confidential”, “Proprietary” or some similar designation or should reasonably be considered to be confidential or proprietary due to its nature or the context of its disclosure.

Except as explicitly authorized in writing by this Agreement or otherwise, each party will: (a) not use, for its own benefit or the benefit of any third party, the other party's Confidential Information; and (b) use all reasonable care, but in no event less care than it takes to protect its own Confidential Information of similar importance, to protect the other party's Confidential Information from unauthorized use, disclosure and publication.
Both parties acknowledge that the breach of this Section 11 could cause great or irreparable injury to the disclosing party and that pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief, and therefore, that upon any such unauthorized disclosure by the receiving party, the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
Within five (5) days after termination of this Agreement, each receiving party shall destroy or deliver to the disclosing party, at the disclosing party’s option, all materials in receiving party’s possession or control that contain or disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.

The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
