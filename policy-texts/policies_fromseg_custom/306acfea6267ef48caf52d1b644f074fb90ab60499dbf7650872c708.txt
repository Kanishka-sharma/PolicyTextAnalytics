We will only send you emails if you opt-in to receive them.
Registration: 
	In order to get the most out of our website, guests are encouraged to first complete a Pep Boys GloveBox Account registration form.
During registration a guest is required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and vehicle information.
This information is used to create a personal account for the guest and to contact the user about Pep Boys' products and services.
It is useful also as they can receive updates via e-mail or text message regarding the status of their orders as they flow through the delivery process or the status of their vehicle during the service process.
Order: 
	We request information from the guest on our order form.
A guest must provide contact information (such as name, shipping address and email address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
==========
This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the guest.
The contact information may also be used to contact the guest about Pep Boys' products and services if the guest opt-ins to receive emails.
You may create a GloveBox Account during the ordering process, but you are not required to do so.
==========
Cookies: 
	A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the guest.
Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
Once the guest closes their browser, the cookie is stored for 30 days.
==========
By setting a cookie on our site, the guest would not have to log-in with a password more than once per visit, thereby saving time while on our site.
If a guest rejects the cookie, they may still use our site but would have to re-enter preference information, such as favorite store and vehicle information.
If a site guest rejects the cookies, the guest will not be able to log in.
Without logging in, they will still be able to access our site but will not have access to certain areas of the site.
Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our guests to enhance their experience each time they visit PepBoys.com.
==========

	We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the website, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, including operating systems, browser information, and referring and subsequent sites.
Such information is not linked to personally identifiable information.
Cookies and log files may be placed or tracked by our web-analytics providers.
==========
Emails, Promotions, Surveys, Contests and User Generated Content: 
	From time-to-time we may request information from guests via sale announcements, surveys, contests, ratings, reviews, or other user generated content.
Participation in these activities is completely voluntary and the guest therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).
Information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with our website and for contacting users about Pep Boys' products and services.

We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site.
We do not retain your friend’s information.
==========
Sharing:
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
We partner with third parties to provide services to support our business.
==========
For example, we use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and one or more processing companies to collect credit card information and bill guests for goods and services and to monitor for fraud.
We also partner with other third parties to provide specific services.
For example, our website is hosted by a third party so it may also receive certain information about you.
We may share names, credit card information or other personally identifiable information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
We do not authorize these third parties or the shipping company to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing services to us.
However, we have no control over the disclosure and use policies and practices of any of these third parties.
They may store your information in locations where they have facilities.
We may share your information with our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates or in the event of a corporate merger, acquisition, sale, dissolution or similar event.
If we believe that we are required by a valid law, rule, regulation or court order to share information about our guests or if we believe it is necessary to protect the safety or rights of Pep Boys, its associates, customers or third parties, we may do so.
==========
Links:
Our website contains links to other sites.
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
We encourage our guests to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

==========
Security:
We want our guests to feel confident when they shop with us and trust us with their personal information.
We take every reasonable precaution to protect our guest’s personal information both online and offline.
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of information provided to us and guests do so at their own risk.
Guests may chose to create a username and password in order to complete a GloveBox registration, appointment or purchase.
Please keep this information confidential.
When our registration/order form asks guests to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected by ssl security measures.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing."
If you have any questions about the security of your information, you can contact us at 1-800-PEP-BOYS (737-2697).
