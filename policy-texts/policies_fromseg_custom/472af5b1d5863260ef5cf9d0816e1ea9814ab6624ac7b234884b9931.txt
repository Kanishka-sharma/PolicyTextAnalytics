Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any   member from any mailing list upon the member's request.
In addition, Trade Me will send   newsletters and other communications to members.
Newsletters will contain clear and   obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing   list.
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you   to email us with your questions or   comments.
==========
Emailing tools Trade Me provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to Trade Me or to   send references to a specific listing to a friend.
You may not use the "Email this   listing to a friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send   spam or otherwise send content that would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions.
We do not permanently   store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses.
==========

We may use your contact information from the   registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material   from some of our affiliated partners.
Your contact information is also used to contact   you when necessary.
==========
Updating your personal information Trade Me provides you with ways in which you can update your personal information,   including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc.
Trade Me will store   previous email addresses against your profile to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions - specifically the use of   one account per member.
Delivery address details Trade Me enables you to save one or more of your delivery addresses which we will store   against your profile.
When you buy an item you have the option of selecting a delivery   address which we will then send to the seller.
We will never give the seller your   address without your permission.

When you set up each auction you can choose to   have the saved message sent automatically or edit your message at that time.

Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your Trade Me   password to any third parties.
If you choose to share your user name, email address and   password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you   are responsible for all actions taken with this information and therefore you should   review that third party's privacy policy.

==========
Credit and debit card security We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information, including   credit and debit card information.
We protect your credit and debit card information during transmission by using the Secure Sockets   Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts your information when transmitted over the   Internet.
Trade Me retains only partial card details.
However they may be held by   either Direct Payment Solutions (DPS) - review their Privacy Policy - or Paystation - review   their Privacy Policy - depending on which provider processes the transaction.
When topping up your Trade Me account by credit/debit card, you may have the option to "save   this card for next time".
If you choose this option, your credit/debit card details are   encrypted and securely stored by DPS or Paystation.
==========
API Information that you share on Trade Me may also be accessed by applications using Trade   Me's API.
In most cases, only publicly accessible information is made available through the API.
However, some applications enable you to interact with Trade Me in a way that requires   you to login.
To do this, you will need to go through a secure process on Trade Me   called OAuth, and agree to let the application connect to your account.
The API never   shares your login details with anyone.
If you allow an application to connect to your Trade Me account, the application will   retrieve information that is normally only available when you're logged in.
This may   include some of the information found within My Trade Me, such as members' email   addresses from past and current trades.
In order for applications that use Trade Me's API to connect to your   Trade Me account, the owners of those applications will have already agreed to Trade   Me's API terms and conditions.
You should only allow applications you trust to access your Trade Me account.
Job applications The "Apply Online" feature enables you to send a job application to organisations   advertising on Trade Me Jobs.
==========
We forward these applications directly to the advertiser   listing the job.
They may be viewed in the advertiser's "My Trade Me" page and are   stored on our servers for a limited time.
We do not read these applications.
