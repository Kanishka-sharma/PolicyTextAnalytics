Exactag Product and Services Privacy Policy
Analytics Technology
Exactag’s technology is used by its customers—ad agencies and advertisers—to measure the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns.
==========
It allows advertisers to collect and store data about Internet users (devices) and use them for analysis and marketing attribution purpose.
Data Collection
When you visit a website or mobile application that shares non-personal information about your activity with Exactag, we will use that information to help our clients to understand the impact of their advertising activities.
Exactag uses a cookie mechanism for this purpose, but only on an anonymous basis.
A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on a computer or mobile device when, with a browser, a user views advertisements or websites of one of Exactag’s clients.
The cookie does not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or anything similar that identifies an individual (according to EU laws, personal data is any data that „directly and indirectly“ identifies a person).
==========
Instead the cookie contains: a random identification number, opt-out or opt-in choice options, or information about campaign activity on an advertiser’s site.
Using the cookies’ random identification numbers, Exactag collects and stores in the cookie-based profiles anonymous information such as: device type, operating system, browser version, geographic location, or facts about interactions with advertisements (such as number of clicks or views).
During web requests to Exactag web-servers, our system is exposed to the IP addresses of user devices.
==========
Exactag is in full compliance with local data privacy laws and is not only anonymising the data according to local regulations, but even deletes it.
Data Security and Protection
Exactag implements reasonable security measures to protect all data collected and used by Exactag technology.
At every step, Exactag adapts all relevant security and safety practices, and employs modern security hardware and software provided by recognized world-leading manufacturers.
Physical environment security is also ensured; thus, Exactag solutions are hosted and data are stored only in Tier III+ data centres, classified according to official data centre classification.
==========
Exactag Allows Internet Users to Opt out of:

Tracking of views/clicks/visits across domains of different advertisers’ sites through Exactag technology

The opt-out process erases all previously collected data and places an alternative Exactag cookie into the Internet user’s browser with special indication of an “opt-out” choice and with no other data.
The cookie applies to the specific computer or mobile device and browser only.
If an Internet user wishes to opt out on other browsers, computers or mobile devices, he or she must repeat the process.
Please also note that if all cookies are erased from the computer or mobile device, the opt-out cookie is also erased and the process must be repeated.
The cookie installed by the process of the objection, so called “exactag_new_optout”.

Cookie Policy
General Information
Websites use smart and useful techniques to enhance user-friendliness and to make the site as interesting as possible for each visitor.
One of the best known techniques involves cookies.
Cookies can be used by website owners or third parties – like advertisers – who communicate through the website you visit.
Using cookies is safe.
It is impossible to retrace personal information such as phone numbers or e-mail addresses by using cookies.
They are, thus, unsuitable for direct marketing techniques like telemarketing and spam.

The purpose is threefold: we want to guarantee your privacy, the user friendliness, and the financing of our website as best as we can.
The following explanation tells you more about the cookies used on and through our website and for what purposes.
Cookies That Ensure the Website Can Function Properly
Our website uses cookies for:

Reading your browser settings so that your screen will reproduce our website in the best possible way
Evenly spreading the load on the website, so that the website remains accessible at all times
Providing the possibility to react to our website

Cookies Through Which We Can Measure the Website’s Use
We use cookies to continuously try to measure how many people visit our website and what parts of the website they visit most.
This tells us what components of the website draw our visitors’ interest most.
==========
The information thus gathered is used for statistics.
These statistics provide us with insight into how frequently our webpage is visited, where exactly visitors spend most of their time, etc.
This enables us to draft the website’s structure, navigation and the contents as user friendly as possible for you.
We will never trace any statistics to individuals.
==========

Google Analytics
To enable us to optimise our website and our service, we use Google Analytics, which is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”).
Google Analytics uses what are known as “cookies”: these are text files stored on your computer and used to analyse your website usage.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
However, if IP anonymisation is enabled on this website, within member states of the European Union, or in other states that are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area Google first abbreviates your IP address.
The full IP address will only be transmitted in exceptional circumstances to one of Google’s servers in the USA, where it will then be abbreviated.
==========
Google will use this information on behalf of our website operator to analyse your use of the website in order to compile reports about website activities for the website operator and to perform other services connected with the use of the website and of the Internet.
The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged or combined with other data by Google.
You can prevent cookies from being stored by applying the appropriate settings in your browser software; please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their full extent.
You may also prevent Google from collecting data generated by the cookie referring to your website usage (including your IP address), and from processing these data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available from the following
link tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
As an alternative to the browser add-on or within browsers on mobile devices, please click on this link to prevent Google Analytics from collecting data in this website in future (the opt-out only works in this browser, and only for this domain).

This particularly applies to cases where our webpage contains so-called embedded elements: texts, documents, pictures or short films that are stored at another party, but are shown on, in, or through our website.
==========

==========
Please be aware that if you do not want cookies, we can no longer guarantee our website to function properly.
Some functions of the site may be lost, while you may no longer be able to see certain websites.
