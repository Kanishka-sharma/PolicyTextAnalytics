Other than for Evidence Based Nursing, or where we are hosting information for you (such as on BMJ Portfolio), the BMJ Group shall be the data controller.
We will make every effort to protect your privacy by adopting a consistently high level of site security and adhering to strict company policies on how we store and use personal information.
==========

If we make any changes to our privacy policy, we will post the revisions on our site.
1.
==========
What information is being collected and how is it used?There are various sections of the website, for which we collect different information.
What we collect and how this is used is as follows:
1.1 Registered UsersMany of our websites require subscriptions and/or registration to access certain functions, services or content.
You will know what information is being collected via these processes when you complete required details prior to submission (including which information is mandatory).
On some of our websites, where you submit a response for publication your name and other personal details may be published.
You should check the policy on the relevant submission page on the specific BMJ Group website.
==========
We will collect data relating to any transactions you carry out through our website(s) and of the fulfillment of your orders.
We collate data about registered users and which publications and services they have subscribed to so to understand our customers and try and easily fulfill their subscription requirements.
For conferences we will use your personal data also to inform the venue and caterers of all delegates, share that with any co-owners of a conference ( where applicable), create a delegate list of attendees and sponsors which will be distributed to all attendees and sponsors.
==========
Once you start using our sites, we may track and keep a record of the pages you visit.
We collect this data from groups of users to get a sense of how people are using our sites and which content and areas are most popular.
This helps us improve what we offer on our sites.
We will also use your data to monitor for any unauthorised use of our websites, content or subscriptions to our publications (for example individuals subscribing individually for institutions).
==========
We may also disclose your identity and contact details to any third party claiming material posted by you is defamatory or violates their intellectual property rights or right to privacy.
You will be given at least one  opportunity to opt in or out (as applicable) from receiving marketing emails from the BMJ Group and third parties.
For users who have opted to receive marketing emails from BMJ Group ( and others where indicated and there is a jointly supplied product or service) , and visit our websites through links provided in these emails, we may send back information about your website usage to our third party email direct marketing provider.
This is for the purpose of understanding the effectiveness of our email marketing campaigns and for targeting future email campaigns.

Cookies 
3.1 What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a website.
Cookies are widely used by websites to help remember small amounts of information and give you a better experience using the website.
For example, a cookie will help the website to recognise your device the next time you visit so you don’t have to log on again, they will remember what items you placed in a shopping basket or recall your preferences such as which language you want to read a site in.
Certain cookies contain a limited amount of personal information.
For example, if you click “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username.
==========
Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information to help us analyse how well our website is performing overall so we can try and improve it.
3.2 How we use Cookies
BMJ Group uses cookies on most of our websites to perform different functions.
These are grouped into four main categories:
Technically Necessary Cookies
Some essential functions of our websites are only possible if information is stored persistently between each page you look at.
==========
For instance, if you log in to a site to access subscriber only content, we use a cookie to remember that you are logged in, so you do not have to enter your details on each page you visit.
Customisation and Personalisation Cookies
In order to allow you as an individual, or our institutional customers, to customise our products and websites, we need to remember who you are and what you want.
We use cookies to record your preferences regarding website appearance, what content you’ve already read, and to present the information that is most relevant to you.
Performance  Monitoring Cookies
We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance.
This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise.
==========
When we send marketing emails to users who have chosen to receive them, we use a cookie that lets us track the success of campaigns.
We may use this information to determine which of our emails are more interesting to users, or to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them.
We don’t use cookies to find out how specific individuals use our products, only to gather general statistics that can help us give you a better experience.
==========
Third Party Cookies
BMJ Group websites sometimes integrate with other companies’ sites.
For example, we integrate with social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook, to make it easier for you to share what you have read.
These sites place their own cookies on your browser as a result of us including their icons and ‘like’ or ‘share’ buttons on our sites.
Like most commercial publishers we also sell advertising space, or ‘banner ads’ on some of our websites.
These ads are served directly from a 3rd party advertising broker.
They place cookies on your browser in order to track how many people have seen a particular ad, and for other technical reasons.
3.3 How to remove or block Cookies
Your internet browser has tools that allow you to remove or block cookies.
==========

Your personal data is stored in our databases or those of our contractors  which is only available to the web administrators of us and our contractors and selected authorised people on a password protected basis (except where referred to in the final paragraph of Clause 1.3 herein).
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA who work for us or are of our suppliers.
Such staff may be engaged in among other things, hosting the fulfilment of your order, processing of your payment details and the provision of support services by submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or process.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely by us and our contractors and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Please do not share your password(s) with anyone.
==========
5.1 SecurityWe understand that the security of your information is important to you.
We also understand that our continued success as a publisher on the web relies on our ability to communicate with you in a secure manner.
We adhere to the highest standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in our operations.
==========
We use several measures to authenticate your identity when you visit our site.
We also take steps to protect your information as it travels the internet, and to make sure all information is as secure as possible against unauthorised access and use (for example, by hackers).
We review our security measures regularly.
==========
Despite our best efforts, and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet, or anywhere else.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
5.2 AuthenticationYou should not share your user name and password with other people.

It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see below).
5.4 Data within our wallsThe information we collect about people visiting the site is stored in secure environments that are not available to any other individual or party.
==========
We have mechanisms in place to protect data.
One such mechanism is called a "firewall."
A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through.
It safeguards our computer systems and your information.
==========
We also use system and application logs to track all access.
We review these logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.
