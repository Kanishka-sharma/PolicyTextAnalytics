From Meta

This policy is under review by the Board of trustees in
preparation for the policy to be translated and made official on every Wikimedia project.
The policy will be linked from the
footer of every page.
Please discuss this on the talk
page.'
The official version of this policy can be found on the Foundation wiki (link not yet live).
==========
This policy may be changed without prior
notice at the discretion of the Board


Summary
If you only read the Wikimedia project websites, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs
by web sites in general.
If you contribute to the Wikimedia projects, you are publishing every word you post publicly.
If you write something,
assume that it will be retained forever.
This includes articles, user pages and talk pages.
Some limited exceptions are described
below.
==========
Publishing on the wiki and public data
Simply visiting the web site does not expose your identity publicly (but see private
logging below).
When you edit any page in the wiki, you are publishing a document.
This is a public act, and you are identified
publicly with that edit as its author.
Identification of an author
When you publish a page in the wiki, you may be logged in or not.
If you are logged in, you will be identified by your user name.
This may be your real name if you so choose, or you may choose
to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name you selected when you created your account.
==========
If you have not logged in, you will be identified by your network IP address.
This is a series of four numbers which
identifies the internet address from which you are contacting the wiki.
Depending on your connection, this number may be
traceable only to a large internet service provider, or specifically to your school, place of business, or home.
It may be
possible that the origin of this IP address could be used in conjunction with any interests you express implicitly or explicitly
by editing articles to identify you even by private individuals.
It may be either difficult or easy for a motivated individual to connect your network IP address with your real-life identity.
==========
Therefore if you are very concerned about privacy, you may wish to log in and publish under a pseudonym.
When using a pseudonym,
your IP address will not be available to the public, but it will be stored on the wiki servers for a relatively short amount of
time.
Thus it will be available to developers and may be released under certain circumstances (see below).
If you use a company mail server from home or telecommute and use a DSL or cable internet connection, it is likely to be very
easy for your employer to identify your IP address and find all of your IP based Wikimedia project contributions.
Using a user
name is a better way of preserving your privacy in this situation.
==========
However, remember to disconnect yourself after using a
pseudonym to avoid allowing others to use your identity.
Cookies
The wiki will set a temporary session cookie (PHPSESSID) whenever you visit the site.
If you do not intend to ever log in, you
may deny this cookie, but you cannot log in without it.
It will be deleted when you close your browser session.
More cookies may be set when you log in, to avoid typing in your user name (or optionally password) on your next visit.
These
last up to 30 days.
You may clear these cookies after use if you are using a public machine and don't wish to expose your
username to future users of the machine.
(If so, clear the browser cache as well.)
==========
Passwords
Many aspects of the Wikimedia projects community interactions depend on the reputation and respect that is built up through a
history of valued contributions.
User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user's edit history.
All users are
encouraged to select strong passwords and to never share them.
No one shall knowingly expose the password of another user to
public release either directly or indirectly.
==========
Private logging
Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server.
Most web servers routinely maintain access
logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites
link to this one, and what web browsers people are using.
It is not the intention of the Wikimedia projects to use this
information to keep track of legitimate users.
These logs are used to produce the site statistics pagesÂ (http://meta.wikimedia.org/stats/); the raw log data is not made public, and is normally
discarded after about two weeks.
==========
Here's a sample of what's logged for one page view:
64.164.82.142 - - [21/Oct/2003:02:03:19 +0000]
"GET /wiki/draft_privacy_policy HTTP/1.1" 200 18084
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_projects:Village_pump"
"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/85.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.5"

Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems, in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders
that overwhelm the site, or very rarely to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of the
wiki.
Policy on release of data derived from page logs
It is the policy of Wikimedia that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs will not be released by the
developers who have access to it, except as follows:

In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement
With permission of the affected user
To Jimbo Wales, his legal counsel, or his designee, when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints.
Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or
resolve technical issues.
Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in
the targetting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers
Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the
public.
==========
Wikimedia policy does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described
above.
Sharing information with third parties
All text added to Wikimedia projects is available for reuse under the terms of the GFDL.
Wikimedia will not sell or share private information, such as email addresses, with third parties, unless you agree to release
this information, or it required by law to release the infomation.
Security of information
The Wikimedia Founadtion makes no guarantee against unauthorized access to any information you provide.
This information will
be available to all developers with access to the servers.
==========
E-mail, mailing lists and IRC

Wikimail
You may provide your e-mail address in your preferences.
This allows other logged-in users may send email to you through the wiki (unless you disable this in your preferences).
Your
address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly if the email bounces.
The email address may be used by the
Wikimedia Foundation to communicate with users on a wider scale.
If you do not provide an email address, you will not be able to reset your password if you forget it.
However, you may contact
one of Wikimedia developer to enter a new mail address in your preferences.
You can remove your email address from your preferences at any time to prevent it being used.
==========
Mailing lists
If you subscribe to one of the project mailing lists
(http://mail.wikimedia.org/), your address will be exposed to any other subscriber.
The list archives of most of
Wikimedia's mailing lists are public, and your address may find itself quoted in messages.
The list archives are also archived by
Gmane services.
==========
Mails are usually not deleted or modified, but it may be done in extreme cases.
Information email adresses
Some email adresses (see below) may forward mail to a team of volunteers trusted by the community to use a ticket system
(OTRS) to view them and answer them.
Mail sent to the system is not publicly visible, but is visible to this group of wikimedia
editors.
By sending a mail to one of these addresses, your address may become public within this group.
The OTRS team may discuss
the contents of your mail with other contributors in order to best answer your query.
Addresses that direct to OTRS system are:

info-de@wikipedia.org
info-en@wikipedia.org

Mail to board@wikimedia.org or to board member's private addresses may also be forwarded to the OTRS team.
==========
IRC
IRC channels are not officially part of Wikimedia proper.
By
participating to an IRC channel, your IP address will be exposed to other participants.
Different channels have different
policies on whether logs may be published.
==========
User data
Data on users, such as the times at which they edited and the number of edits they have made are publicaly available via "user
contributions" lists, and occasionally in agregated forms published by other users.
Removal of user accounts
User accounts, once created, can not be removed.
However, it may be possible for a developer to change your username, but you
need to make such arrangements yourself.
There is no guarantee provided by the Wikimedia Foundation that a name will be changed
on request.
==========
See Right to vanish for further details.
Whether specific user information is deleted is dependant on the deletion policies of the project that contains the
information.
Deletion of content
Deleting text from Wikimedia projects does not really delete them.
==========
In normal articles, anyone can look at a previous version
and see what was there.
If an article is "deleted", any sysop/administrator, meaning almost anyone trusted not to abuse the
deletion capability, can see what was deleted.
Only a developer can permanently delete information from the Wikimedia projects
and there is no guarantee this will happen except in response to legal action.
