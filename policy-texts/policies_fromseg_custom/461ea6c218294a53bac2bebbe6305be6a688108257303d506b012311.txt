LATIMES.COM strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
This policy covers how we treat personally identifiable information and other information that we collect, store, and receive, including information related to your use of our products and services.
Personally identifiable information is information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
Please note this policy applies only to information collected by LATIMES.COM online and does not impact information collected or obtained by LATIMES.COM or its affiliates through other means.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that LATIMES.COM does not control.
==========
How we gather information from users.
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.
You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information.
Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g., newsletters, updates, and other products), or make a purchase.
You may also provide information when you participate in sweepstakes or contests, voting and polling activities, and other interactive areas of our site.
==========
LATIMES.COM may combine information that we collect with information we obtain from third parties and affiliates.
Like most Web sites, LATIMES.COM also collects and stores information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.
For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, and information provided by and about your Internet browser.
We may also use "cookie" technology.
Among other things, we may use cookies or other tracking technology for the purposes of storing your user name and password, to spare you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or to control the advertising you see on our site.
Moreover, we may collect and store data concerning the pages on the site that you view, as you navigate to various pages on our site.
Because we are aware of the content appearing on the pages that you view, it is possible that we will be able to make relatively accurate assumptions about your interests and preferecnes from this navigational information that we collect.
As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password, if applicable.
==========
Additionally, we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.
Finally, information you post to public areas of the site is not private, and such information is not covered by this policy.
Do not post personal information to public areas of the site unless you intend to make that information public.
What we do with the information we collect.
We collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
For example, we may use personally identifiable information collected on LATIMES.COM to communicate with you regarding ourTerms of Service and privacy policy, products and services offered by LATIMES.COM, other Tribune Company affiliates and partners, or third-party advertisers or contractors; to administer sweepstakes and contests; to process e-commerce transactions; to attribute content that you make available through the Web site; to contact you about your content; to customize the advertising and content you see, including the display of targeted and contextual advertisements; for the purpose for which the information was collected; to process and respond to inquiries; to improve the content and navigability of the Web site; to alert you to new Web site features, special events, products and services; to generate anonymous and/or aggregated reporting; to enforce the legal terms that govern your use of the Web site; or to engage you in any other topics or matters we think you might find of interest.
We may also use the navigational information we collect and store on your viewing habits, along with any additional information you supply to us, to supply you with services you request or to modify advertising or site content that you view in order to enhance your visit (e.g., we may tailor content or advertisements to better suit your interests or needs).
==========
We reserve the right to share this information with other Tribune Company business units and affiliates, including for example their affiliated Web sites, and with any entities which Tribune Company or one of its subsidiaries operates or in which Tribune Company or one of its subsidiaries has an ownership interest or which are commonly managed by or with a Tribune Company subsidiary (collectively, "Affiliates"); with agents who may provide services or communicate with you on our behalf; and with third-party advertisers and/or contractors with which LATIMES.COM or an Affiliate have a relationship.
This policy does not apply to any Affiliate's, third-party advertisers', or third-party contractors' use of such information.
Personally identifiable information collected by LATIMES.COM may also be used for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service or ad serving services, for example), or who provide email management, third-party content, billing, processing, shipping, promotions management or other services also may access such information.
LATIMES.COM may aggregate and/or anonymize information collected by LATIMES.COM or through the site, so that the information does not identify you.
==========
As one example, we may combine information about your navigation or usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features on our site are most attractive.
We may use aggregated and/or anonymized information, and may disclose it to Affiliates and third parties, without limitation.
Information sharing and disclosure.
We may rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with non-Affiliated companies in order to provide services or products that you have requested, when we have your permission, or as described in this policy, including under the circumstances provided below.
Please note that we may not provide you with any notice prior to the types of disclosures listed below.
We may share your information with any Affiliate or our agents who may provide services or communicate with you on our behalf.
We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.
We may disclose your information when we believe it necessary or desirable in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations or ourTerms of Service, and/or to protect our rights and property.
==========
We may also share your information, whether aggregated and/or anonymized or not, with any third-party advertisers and/or contractors with which LATIMES.COM or an Affiliate may have a relationship.
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses.
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
==========
Location data.
LATIMES.COM can provide helpful information based on where you are.
If you tell us where you are (by enabling the "Use GPS" functionality or providing a zip code), we may use and store that information to provide you with location-based information, advertising and services.
In order to do this, your location-based information may be passed along to our affiliates, partners and advertisers.
If you want to deactivate this feature, you can either disable the "Use GPS" functionality or delete the zip code you provided.
==========
How we protect information.
LATIMES.COM attempts to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information.
Our servers are protected by reasonable physical and electronic security measures.
==========
Your choice to opt out.
The quality content and information on LATIMES.COM is supported by advertising revenue, and a controlled program of email marketing is an important element of our online publishing business.
Like other Web publishers, we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners or other third parties to email you about services, features, products, special offers and unique content we believe might interest you.
If you prefer not to receive email communications sent directly from our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information we might use for this purpose.
If you decline at the time you provide us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though we may send you information on their behalf.
You may also change your email preferences by logging into your profile, if applicable.
==========
Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements.
LATIMES.COM expects its partners, advertisers and third-party contractors to respect the privacy of our users.
However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, Affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a LATIMES.COM page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.
Also, through LATIMES.COM you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, or features offered by other parties.
