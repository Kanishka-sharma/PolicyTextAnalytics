What Information Does AVG Technologies Collect?
The type of information that we collect and retain depends upon your interaction with our Site and/or our AVG Products.
==========
In general, there are two different categories of information we may collect: 


Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”) refers to information that cannot be used to identify a specific person.
The NPII AVG may collect include, without limitation, information about AVG Products and their installed features, data concerning potential malware threats to your device and the target of those threats, including file names, cryptographic hash, vendor, size, date stamps, information about your devices checkpoints, which may include path, file and application names, copies of applications that are deemed malicious or infected including information on behavior of such applications, their settings and configurations, such as associated registry keys, the date and time, the internet address of the website from which you link directly to our Site, the name of the file or the words you search, and the browser you use to access our Site, type of device, device ID, device name, location of the device and the mobile network (mobile carrier) you use, third party software installed on a device and related settings, installation and uninstallation rates, language, technical parameters and manufacturer of a device, device security information (password attributes, encryption level).
AVG collects NPII and shares them with its Affiliates when you use our AVG Products and when you visit the Site.
This is captured via a standard “cookie”, see our Cookie Statement.
==========
We may gather certain information automatically (when you use our AVG Products or visit our Sites), if this data is classified as PII (as defined below) we will anonymize this data to remove personally identifiable information during or after the collection process, and store it in a database.
This information may include device ID and/or name, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data in order to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
How Do We Use the NPII We Collect?
==========
AVG may use the NPII for the purposes of building anonymous data profiles.
AVG may retain this data for a period of up to five years.
We also use NPII in a limited fashion for the administration and operation of our Site, and to generally improve the overall quality of experience with the information we provide on our Site.
AVG may share NPII or anonymized data with third parties in order to improve our AVG Products and your experience using them.
By visiting our Site or installing and using our AVG Products, you hereby agree with our collection and use of NPII as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
