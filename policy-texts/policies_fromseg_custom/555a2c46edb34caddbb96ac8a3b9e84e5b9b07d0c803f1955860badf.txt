We may analyse this data from time to time to discover usage patterns.

In order to provide these services we require information about your name, email address and some other data.
We work with third parties to provide billing services who may in turn gather and collect information about you.
Some of this information may be returned or made available to Majestic-12 Ltd as a part of normal business processes.
Majestic-12 co-ordinates a distributed computing project to crawl the internet.
