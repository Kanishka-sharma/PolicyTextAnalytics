Effective Date: June 24, 2011
WHO WE ARE: Snapchat (“Snapchat”, “we”, “us”) is a product of Toyopa Group, LLC.
We are currently based in Pacific Palisades, California.
This privacy policy has been prepared to clarify how we gather, utilize, disclose, and protect your personal information, as well as your messaging data (as defined below).
If you have any questions regarding these policies, please send an email to privacy@snapchat.me.
This policy was last revised on June 24, 2011 and we reserve the right to change these policies without notification or warning.
==========
INFORMATION WE COLLECT:
Personal Information:
For the purposes of this privacy policy, ‘personal information’ is taken to mean any information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, e-mail address, or mobile number).
This does not include ‘aggregate’ information, which includes data that we collect about the use of our application and our services.
This privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information in any way.
==========
Snapchat, however, does not collect any of your personal information besides the username and password that you enter when you download and register to use the application.
Usage Data:
Snapchat does not collect personal information about its users except the username and password (hashed).
Optional to the user, we also collect an email, phone number, and facebook id for the purpose of finding friends on the service.
Additionally, we do collect usage information.
==========
This information does not identify individual users, but allows us to collect information regarding how users access and utilize the mobile application (“Usage Data”).
Once a user has downloaded and started using Snapchat, we automatically aggregate information such as the type of device used, its specific operating system, and its device identifier (UDID).
We use all of this information to investigate trends and to restructure and improve the functional aspects of the Snapchat application.
We do not ask for, track, or access any location-specific information from your device at any time while you are using the Snapchat application.
Message Data:
When you send or receive messages using the Snapchat services, we temporarily process and store your images in order to provide our services.
==========
Although the we attempt to delete image data as soon as possible after the message is transmitted, we cannot guarantee that the message data will be deleted in every case.
Consequently, we are not able to guarantee that your messaging data will be deleted in all instances.
Messages, therefore, are sent at the risk of the user.
==========
DATA SECURITY:
The Toyopa Group, LLC is dedicated to securing customer data and, to that end, employs the best security practices to keep your data protected.
As part of the effort to keep your data protected, all contact information and voice data transmitted through the Snapchat application is encrypted with an SSL connection using AES-128 bit encryption between your mobile device and the Snapchat servers.
There are a number of risks in transmitting any kind of data over the public Internet and under no circumstances should you use the Snapchat service to transmit confidential or privileged information of any sort.
OUR AUDIENCE:
The Snapchat service is intended for use by people who are 13 years of age or older.
Minors over the age of 13 should seek permission from their parents to use the application.
==========
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT:
Snapchat cooperates with and assists all government and law enforcement officials to enforce and abide by the law.
Consequently, we may disclose any information or data available, if we believe it is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any and all applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests; (b) enforce the Terms or the Services, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Snapchat, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
