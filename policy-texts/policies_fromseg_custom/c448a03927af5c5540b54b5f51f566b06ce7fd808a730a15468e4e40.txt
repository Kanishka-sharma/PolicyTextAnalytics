Effective date: 12 January 2015
Change.org’s mission is to empower people everywhere to create the change they want to see.
We believe the best way to achieve that mission is to be a technology company using the power of business for social good.
Our Privacy Policy outlines how we get and use information about you, who we share it with, and how you can control your privacy settings.
This information helps us build technology to show you campaigns that are most likely to matter to you.
1.
==========
Information we collect
To run our service and show you relevant content, we need to know a little about you and your interests.
Here we outline what information Change.org collects, and how we collect it.
a.
==========
What we collect
When you sign or create a petition via our platform, an account is created for you.
All your campaign activities are then tied to this account.
By “campaign” we mean petitions, all the activities you can do to promote your petitions via our platform or through third-party sites and services, and any other action through our platform.
==========
Through these activities and upon your general use of our platform, we may collect and/or receive the following information about you that reveals your specific identity, or is directly tied to your specific identity:
your name
your postal address
your telephone number
your email address, or non-email authentication if you are using a mobile device
your profile picture
other information you voluntarily submit (for example: photos)
your unique mobile device ID number if you access our services via a mobile application
your social media account ID and information shared with us via your social media account
your specific activities on the Change.org platform - for example, petitions you have started or signed, sponsored petitions you have signed, or campaigns you have shared or promoted
And possibly:
information inferred about the issues you care about based on your activities on the platform (e.g. animal rights, climate change)
information about you available in public records, or other publicly available databases, such as civic data APIs, which, as an example, we use in the United States to help match citizens with the elected officials who represent them at all levels in government
information about you that we get from third party data providers.
We obtain this data with assurance from these providers that you have consented to the collecting and sharing of this data.
We don’t actively collect sensitive public data such as medical data.
==========
In addition, we only collect information that is permissible to collect in each country where we operate.
We also collect information that does not reveal your specific identity, or does not directly relate to you, such as:
browser and device information
information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies
demographic information and other non-identifying information provided by you (such as a zip code or general geographic area)
b.
How we collect it
When you register for the Change.org platform, you will be asked to create a user profile that includes information such as your user name, city, state, and country.
You may choose to upload photos and provide additional information as well.
==========
When you are signed in to your account, your activities on the Change.org platform (for example: when you sign a petition, create a petition, share someone else’s petition, opt in to being contacted by an advertiser, or skip a sponsored campaign) are tracked and are associated with your account.
When you download and use our existing or future mobile applications, we’ll collect your unique device ID and all your account and activity information will be tied to that unique device ID.
In addition, we may track and collect app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the app, and this information may be associated with your account.
When you use a website that allows for the posting of content to Change.org through our Application Programming Interface (“API”), your activities are recorded as if they were directly on our site and applications.
We may collect information through your activities offline, for example when you respond to user surveys or provide information if we assist you by telephone.
==========
We may obtain information about you from public records, publicly available databases, and third-party providers as described above.
We may obtain certain information through your social media accounts connected to your Change.org account.
If you log in to Change.org via Facebook, we ask for your permission to access certain information about your Facebook account, activities and friends.
Social media sites make information available to all apps through their APIs, such as friend lists.
The information we receive depends on what information you or the social media site decide to give us.
Browser and device information: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Change.org platform you are using.
==========
Cookies and online tracking: We, our service providers, and any ad networks who help us deliver relevant ads to you may use cookies, pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs), and other similar technologies to measure and track general user activities on Change.org and on third party websites.
Like other websites, Change.org will not function properly if cookies are not enabled.
Please review our Cookies Policy for more information.
==========
Third-party analytics providers: We use third-party analytics services like Google Analytics provided by Google Inc. (“Google”) and the Mixpanel service provided by Mixpanel, Inc. (“Mixpanel”).
These analytics services use cookies and similar technologies to analyze how people use our services and compile statistical reports.
Such services may also collect information about Platform visitors’ use of other websites.
For more information on your choices, please see our section below entitled “Your privacy choices”.
IP Address: Your “IP Address” is a designator that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet service provider (ISP).
An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you use our platform and services, along with the time of your visit and the specific page(s) that you visited.
==========
In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information (for example, we may combine your name with your geographical location or combine your name with information about your activities on our platform).
In such case the combined information will be treated by us as personally identifying information and protected accordingly.
2.
==========
How we may use your information
Here are the ways we might use your information to run our platform, provide our services and serve you better content.
We use your information to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as when you create petitions, sign petitions, or participate in other activities on Change.org platforms, sites, apps and third-party sites who use our API and to complete and fulfill your transactions with us.
We need your contact information to send administrative information to you, for example, information regarding our services and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
We use your information for general business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new services, enhancing, improving or modifying our Platform, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of campaigns, and operating and expanding our business activities.
We personalize your experience by presenting petitions, campaigns and offers tailored to you based on what we know about you.
==========
We may also send you promotional communications that we believe may be of interest to you.
We use your information to allow you to participate in events and similar promotions and to administer these activities.
Some of these activities have additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and disclose information about you, so we suggest that you read these rules carefully.
We need information about your social media account and activities to facilitate social sharing functionality, such as sharing content and petitions through the Change.org platform and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
We use your account information to allow you to send email messages to your email contacts through our platform, such as to share a petition.
By using this feature, you guarantee that you have the right to to use and provide us the names and email addresses you submit.
==========
We use information about your computer or device to ensure that our site, apps and APIs function properly and are optimized for your computer or device.
If you are using one of our mobile applications, we use your device ID to recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings.
We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to measure and improve our services and develop features and functionalities on our sites, apps and APIs.
For example, if we see that people using a certain device use the platform the most, we might decide to build an app specifically for that device.
We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to improve the relevance of our marketing campaigns and those of our advertisers.
For example, if you signed a petition regarding the protection of animal rights, you may subsequently see sponsored campaigns from animal protection organizations.
We use IP Addresses for administration and security purposes, such as calculating usage levels of our sites, apps and API, helping diagnose server problems and detecting fraud and spam behavior.
==========
We may use and share aggregated and anonymized information to better understand and serve our users or for optimization of our marketing and ad targeting efforts.
For example, we may compile statistics like the percentage of our users in a state or country who care about animal rights, or the age range of those users.
3.
==========
Who may receive your information
Here we outline when and how information can be shared - either by you via the platform, or by us.
Organizations can pay to promote their campaigns (that's what helps keep the platform free to use), but we won’t share your contact details with them without your permission.
a.
==========
The Change.org community
Your name, general geographic location (such as city, state, country), and a link to your Change.org user profile may be displayed on the landing page for any petition you sign, and on related areas of our platform.
This information will be viewable to any visitor, including the media, search engines, and other organizations that provide archival Internet activities.
If you do not wish to have your personal information displayed on a petition landing page, you may select the option not to display your signature publicly.
We also share your first and last name and city with the person who initiated a petition you have signed, even if you select the option not to display your signature publicly.
If you do not wish to have such information shared with the person who initiated the petition, please do not sign the petition.
==========
We may identify you to the recipients of messages you may choose to send through our platform.
We may, in certain circumstances, share your name and general geographic location with the intended decision maker who is the recipient of the petition.
If you do not wish to have this information shared with the petition recipient, you should not sign the petition.
Our platform provides an open forum for communication by users all around the world.
We do not monitor, verify, or perform any background check on campaign starters, petition signers, or other members of Change.org.
Interacting with others on our platform and the resulting sharing of information is at your own risk.
==========
b. Your other social media platforms
You may share your activities on Change.org with friends on other social media sites, for example, sharing a petition you signed on Facebook.
To do so, you must connect your Change.org account with your social media account.
In such case, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.
If you do not want your information shared with other social media users or with your social media account provider, please do not connect your social media account with your Change.org account and do not use the social sharing features on the Platform.
You may voluntarily share information on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs, and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including the Change.org pages on Facebook and other social media platforms).
Please note that any information you post or disclose through these services will become public information, and may be available to other Change.org users, social media platform users and to the general public.
We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose any information about yourself via the social sharing features of our platform.
For more details regarding posting content to our platform, please see our Terms of Service.
==========
c. Advertisers and ad networks
Only at your election and if you specifically consent, we may share information about you with our advertisers, including your email address, mailing address and the petition you signed.
We may also share your telephone number, but only if you separately consent.
The advertiser may then use this information to communicate with you and send you promotional materials that may be of interest to you.
We do not control the content or frequency of communications that you may receive from our advertisers.
California law permits residents of California to request certain details about what personal information a company shares with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
If you have questions about our sharing practices or your rights under California law, please contact our Privacy Officer with the contact details listed at the end of this privacy policy.

There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, but such residual information will no longer be tied to your identity.
