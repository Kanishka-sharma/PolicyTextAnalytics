DATA QUALITY
We are continually working to maintain the personal data we collect so that it is complete, accurate, relevant and up to date.
BASIS FOR PROCESSING
Many privacy laws require companies to establish a lawful basis for their uses of personal data.
While Nielsen has established different lawful bases for different types of processing, in almost all cases our basis for processing personal data will be one of the following:
DATA MINIMIZATION AND COLLECTION LIMITATION
Following the concept of data minimization, we limit the collection of personal  data to the extent possible while still enabling us to derive meaningful and accurate measurements and insights.
LIMITED USE AND RETENTION
We restrict access to and use of personal data to Nielsen associates and service providers with a legitimate business purpose.
We have established records retention policies to limit how long we keep personal data.
ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE AND PORTABILITY
We provide individuals with reasonable opportunities to access the personal data Nielsen holds about them and correct it if it’s inaccurate.
Depending on your country or state (US) of residence, under applicable law individuals may have various additional rights with respect to personal data processed.

Individuals that are interested in exercising one or more of the rights described above can submit a request using the form here or contact us at privacy.department@nielsen.com.
Nielsen does not discriminate against individuals who exercise their rights under applicable law.
Only the individual data subject or an “Authorized Agent” permitted to act on their behalf may submit a request.
An “Authorized Agent” means a natural person or a business entity that has been properly authorized to act on the individual’s behalf.
Please note, we may deny a request from an Authorized Agent if they do not submit proof that they have been authorized by the individual data subject to act on their behalf.
A request must:
We cannot respond to a request or provide personal data if we cannot verify the identity of the requestor or their authority to make the request.
To verify a requestor’s identity, we will match data provided when the request is submitted to any personal data we already maintain.
