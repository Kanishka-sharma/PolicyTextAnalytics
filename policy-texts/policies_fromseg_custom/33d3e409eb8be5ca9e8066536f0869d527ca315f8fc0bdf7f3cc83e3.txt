Smartsheet.com Privacy Policy
Last Updated: March 24, 2010
Smartsheet.com has created this privacy policy (“Policy”) as customer privacy and transparency is fundamental to maintaining the highest levels of trust and security.
Smartsheet.com reserves the right to change this Policy, and if it does, the revised Policy will be posted on this Site.
You can at any time modify your opt out elections.
==========
(see opt-out policy below)
As is the case with most Web sites, the Smartsheet.com Web site (the “Site”) gathers information in two ways:
when you voluntarily submit information to us through various pages of this Site; and
through the operation of the Site technology.
When we collect information by means of you voluntarily submitting it to us, we will notify you as to why we are asking for it and how it will be used.
Set out in this Policy are some of the circumstances when we might collect personal data and what it may be used for.
We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the “Service”) to give us an email address, and upon subscribing, financial information such as billing name and credit card number.
Smartsheet.com uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for individuals and their organizations.
==========
We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events.
Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, by following the opt out instructions located in the e-mails we may send you, by changing your privacy settings in the Service, or by contacting us at any time.
Smartsheet.com reserves the right to send its existing customers certain communications relating to the Service as part of our commercial relationship with you, such as service announcements and administrative messages without offering the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
Smartsheet.com may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses, hardware profiles, and browser software versions.
This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service.
We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
==========
Cookies:
When you interact with the Site we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful.
When you come to our Site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer.
Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to identify the customers and visitors of the Site to the Smartsheet.com Web servers.
Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally.
They merely recognize your browser.
Unless you choose to identify yourself to Smartsheet.com, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a trial, you remain anonymous to Smartsheet.com.
==========
Cookies generally operate in two forms: session and persistent-based.
Session cookies exist only during an online session.
They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer.
They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.

Smartsheet.com uses persistent cookies that only Smartsheet.com can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Smartsheet.com customer or prior visitor to the Site (whatever the case may be).
==========
