C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:
If the Submissions or content provider, member or user believes that the Submissions or content that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the Submissions or content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such Submissions or content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

Submissions or content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the Submissions or content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which OpenDNS is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
