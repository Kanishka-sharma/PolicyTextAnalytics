We may disclose personal information we collect, such as the categories described above, primarily to make available to you the financial products and services that we and our service providers provide.

We do not disclose personal information about former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities.

We prohibit our service providers from using personal information except for the specific purpose for which we supply it to them, and otherwise comply with the legal requirements applicable to the personal information at issue.
==========
Information regarding external financial accounts will not be disclosed to non-affiliated entities.
Information regarding external financial accounts may be disclosed to our corporate affiliates to provide you with account aggregation services and for marketing purposes unless you opt-out of such sharing.
How may you limit (opt-out of) the sharing of your information?
==========
The law allows you to opt-out of our sharing personal information about you in certain circumstances with nonaffiliated third party companies; that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures.
However, we do not currently share information about you with any nonaffiliated third party that triggers this opt-out right.
Accordingly, there is no need for you to opt-out or take any other affirmative action telling us not to share such information with nonaffiliated third parties.
The law also allows you to opt-out of our sharing certain personal information about you (e.g., information other than your transactions and experiences with us such as your credit report) among our affiliated companies; that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures.
However, we only share your transactions and experiences information (e.g., account balance, trading activity, loan amount, and account history) with our affiliated companies.
Therefore, there is no need for you to exercise such opt-out right.
==========
Finally, the law also gives you the right to limit some kinds of marketing from our affiliated companies.
You may elect not to have our affiliated companies market their products or services to you where such marketing is based on information about you that we share with them.
Since our affiliated companies, from time to time, do engage in such marketing, we are providing you with the ability to opt-out so that you do not receive these types of marketing communications from us in the future.
==========
To limit these marketing offers, please contact us by using the email or telephone by using the applicable contact information provided below.
Your choice to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies will apply until you notify us to change your choice or for at least five years from when you tell us your choice.
Once that period expires, you will receive a renewal notice that will allow you to continue to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies for at least another five years.
For consumers with joint accounts, an opt-out direction by one joint account holder will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint account holders.
==========
Where do we store personal information?
Generally, the personal information that we collect from you will be transferred to and stored in the United States and/or other countries with different levels of privacy protection than may apply in your country of residence.
Your personal information also may be processed in the United States, working for us or for one of our related companies, affiliates or suppliers.
Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services.
By submitting personal information via our website, you agree to any such transfers, storage or other processing.

It is important to note that some or all of your personal information provided to third party service providers may be held by them in countries other than your own, including in particular the United States.
You acknowledge and understand that your personal information will be subject to the applicable laws of each such jurisdiction, which may not provide for the same protection as your country of residence.
For example, government entities in the United States, amongst other countries, may have certain legislative rights to access your personal information.
If you would like access to written information about our policies and practices with respect to service providers outside your jurisdiction, you may contact our Chief Privacy Officer, by e-mail at CPO@etrade.com, who will address your questions about the collection, use, disclosure or storage of personal information by our service providers worldwide.
