ABOUT MYNTELLIGENCE PRODUCTS
Myntelligence does not provide products and services directly to consumers.
Instead, Myntelligence has products and services that help businesses (e.g. marketers, advertising agencies, publishers, etc.) engage in interest-based advertising and marketing.
Interest based advertising is the practice of delivering relevant content and advertising to people based on their interests, activities, and behaviours.
==========
Note that when providing interest-based advertising services to its clients, Myntelligence does not use personal data that directly identifies data subjects as specific persons (e.g. name, address, email address, phone number, etc.), but we may use other pseudonymised personal data as further described below.
Myntelligence wants digital advertising to be a useful complement to data subjects’ online experience.
We want to deliver personalized, well-chosen ads to help data subjects discovering things of interest to them (e.g. new websites, new products, new services).
Myntelligence uses complex technology to pick the best ads to show, based on everything we know about the context: the ad itself, the page that needs an ad, the time of day and other external factors, and information from data subjects’ browser or mobile device digital advertising identifier that we use to predict what advertising would be most relevant and interesting to data subjects.
If we can make ads more useful and interesting for data subjects, then we will also make advertising more valuable to advertisers, and data subjects’ visits will make websites more money per ad, and power their investments in the websites, apps, online features and content that they provide to data subjects for free.
==========
Myntelligence has the following products and services (collectively, “Myntelligence Products”):
·        software as a service (SaaS) products, including the so-called «Marketing Operating System» platform, that Myntelligence provides to clients.
Myntelligence Products assist clients in collecting and organizing personal data about their customers from their own sources (e.g. clients’ websites, mobile applications, advertising campaigns, CRM systems, data partners, etc.) and then using this information for marketing purposes;
·        additional products and services that help clients use personal data to deliver personalized content and advertising to online users, via computers, phones, and other mobile devices.
In particular, Myntelligence helps clients to identify relationships across computers, phones and other mobile devices, so that a user can benefit from targeted advertising across multiple devices.

==========

==========
COOKIES
We are a third party in relation to the websites and/or mobile apps from which data subjects are coming from (collectively, “Source of Origin”).
Since when data subjects visit the Source of Origin, we, as well as our partners (listed in Section 5.2 below) install profiling cookies on data subjects’ browsers, we hereby aim at explaining what cookies are and how they are used.
5.1.
==========
WHAT COOKIES ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE FOR
Cookies are small text files that the websites visited by a data subject send directly to its terminal (usually, to the browser), where they are memorised to be transmitted to the same websites at the following visit of the same by the same data subject (so-called «first part cookies»).
During the web surfing of a website, a data subject may receive on its terminal also cookies of other websites or of other web servers (so called «third-party cookies»); this happens because there may be elements on the visited website, such as images, maps, sounds, links to specific web pages of other domains that are on servers other than the server on which the requested page is placed.
In other words, such cookies are set up on a website other than the one that is currently visited.
Cookies may have a duration limited to a single session of navigation on the browser (so-called «session cookies»), and, in such event, they deactivate automatically once the browser is closed by the data subject; or may have a predetermined duration and, in such event, they will remain memorised and active on data subject’s hard disk until the expiry date, thus continuing collecting information during different sessions of navigation on the browser (so-called «permanent cookies»).
==========
Cookies are used for several purposes.
Certain cookies are necessary in order to allow data subjects to surf websites and benefit of their functionalities (so-called «technical cookies»).
Other cookies are used in order to obtain statistical information, whether in aggregate or not, about the number of data subjects accessing the websites and how the websites are used (so-called «monitoring cookies» or «analytics»).
To the end, other cookies are used in order to track data subjects’ consumer profile and make data subjects viewing advertisings that may be of interest for them, since complying with their preferences and consumer habits (so-called «profiling cookies»).
5.2.
==========
PROFILING COOKIES
Profiling cookies are used to create data subjects’ profiles, based on the preferences and likings showed by them during the navigation on Internet and to make them display advertisings consistent with their profile.
In such way, the advertisings that data subjects will display on the Source of Origin and on other websites that host our cookies could be more of interest for them.
Data subjects’ prior consent is requested in order to install such cookies, as provided pursuant to the Regulation.
For such a reason, when data subjects access the Source of Origin a specific banner is displayed, informing that: (i) profiling cookies are used on the Source of Origin; and (ii) closing the banner, surfing on the home page or clicking whatever element on the home page outside the banner, data subjects are giving their consent to the use of cookies.
In some cases, the Source of Origin may ask data subjects to give an explicit consent to the storing of these cookies, for example by requesting them to click on a specific acceptance button.
For further information, please see the cookies policy of the Source of Origin.
==========
In the event that data subjects express their consent to the use of cookies in this way, the publisher of the Source of Origin may track their consent by means of a specific technical cookie.
In this way, the publisher of the Source or Origin will avoid data subjects displaying the cookies banner during their following visits of the Source of Origin.
Please take into account that, in the event data subjects remove from their browsers such technical cookie with the modalities set forth under Section 5.3(a) below, the track of data subjects’ consent would be lost and, therefore, the cookies banner will be displayed again during their following visit to the Source of Origin.
Data subjects are clearly free to block the installation of profiling cookies in any moment whatsoever and this will not compromise in any manner whatsoever the possibility to visit the Source of Origin and benefit of its contents.
==========

For disabling such profiling cookies data subjects may amend their browser’s settings (please see Section 5.3(a) below) or use our practical interactive tool available at http://www.myntelligence.com/opt-out-tool.
Using the interactive tool to block our profiling cookies, data subjects will receive in any case a technical cookie in order to memorise their preference.
Please consider that, removing all the cookies from the browser, also this technical cookie could be removed and, therefore, data subjects would have to express again their choice to block such cookies using the interactive tool above.
Moreover, we inform data subjects that, through the Source of Origin, information relating to data subjects’ profiles may be acquired through other profiling cookies, installed by third parties with whom Myntelligence has a direct contractual relationship.
These third parties installing cookies on the Source of Origin are those specified in the following table, together with the links to the privacy policy of such third parties, in which data subjects can find all the necessary information on their profiling cookies and on the modalities by which oppose to their installation (opt-out):

HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES AND OPPOSE TO THEIR USE
There are several options to manage, disable and remove the cookies.
(a) Modify browser’s settings: data subjects can follow the instructions provided by their browsers’ producers to discover how to manage, disable or remove all the cookies (technical, analytics and profiling):
·        Explorer: https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies;
·        Chrome: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB&p=cpn_cookies;
·        Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences;
·        Safari: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac;
·        Opera: https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/.
==========
Please be careful in making a choice.
Indeed, by blocking the receipt of all the cookies indiscriminately, including the technical ones, without providing a specific exception for the Source of Origin, data subjects might be no more able to surf on the Source of Origin or to benefit, in whole or in part, of its functionalities.
Furthermore, removing all the cookies from the browser, also the technical cookies could be removed and, therefore, data subjects could remove the preferences set up by using the Source of Origin.
(b) Use our interactive instruments or those provided by third parties: in order to disable Myntelligence’s profiling cookies, data subjects can simply use the interactive tool described in Section 5.2 above.
==========
Data subjects’ choice to oppose to the use of such cookies will not have any consequences on the possibility to surf on the Source of Origin and to use its functionalities and could be revoked by data subjects at any time whatsoever by using the same button.
In order to disable the third-party cookies, please see the privacy policies of those third parties installing cookies (see Section 5.2 above) in order to know the other instruments available to data subjects for managing, disabling and removing cookies and, more in general, to oppose to their use.
Please be reminded that, by disabling third-party cookies: (i) data subjects are opposing to their use not only on the Source of Origin, but on all the Internet websites on which such cookies are used; and (ii) the possibility to surf on the Source of Origin and use its functionalities will not be jeopardised in any manner whatsoever.
When data subjects disable the third-party cookies, data subjects will however display the banner on the cookies on the Source of Origin’s home page; but, in such event, closing the banner and surfing the home page or clicking an element whatsoever outside the banner, data subjects will not receive any third-party cookies duly disabled.
(c) Use the website www.youronlinechoices.com: Your Online Choices is an Internet website managed by the non-profit organisation European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), the English version of the same is available at the address www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/, providing information on the behavioural advertisings based on profiling cookies (www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/about-behavioural-advertising) and allow the Internet users to oppose easily (opt-out) to the installation of the main profiling cookies installed by the marketing operators and used on Internet websites (www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices).
Before using this instrument, we hereby recommend data subjects to read carefully the general terms and conditions of the site Your Online Choices (www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/terms-conditions), the frequent asked questions (FAQ) (www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/faqs) and the users’ guide (www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/opt-out-help).
Please use Your Online Choices consciously.
==========
Indeed, notwithstanding that many of the most important marketing companies using cookies are members of the same, certain third parties installing cookies through the Source of Origin could not be members of Your Online Choices.
Therefore, the use of Your Online Choices does not guarantee that third-party cookies will not be received surfing on the websites.
Please remember that, removing all the cookies from the browser, also the technical cookies released by Your Online Choices in order to remind data subjects’ choices could be removed, thus reactivating third-party cookies.
(d) Use the OBA Icon: by adjusting data subjects’ settings when data subjects click upon the OBA Icon which they find when they click on the advertisements of our clients, which in turn will lead data subjects to a page where they can adjust the way in which their browser settings are configurated.
6.
LAWFUL REASON WE USE TO PROCESS PERSONAL DATA
The lawful reason Myntelligence uses to process personal data is set out in Article 6 GDPR.
Processing shall only be lawful if and to the extent that the data subjects have given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes (“Consent”).
As explained above, data subjects’ prior Consent is requested in order to install profiling cookies, as provided pursuant to the Regulation.
For such a reason, when data subjects access the Source of Origin a specific banner is displayed, informing that: (i) profiling cookies are used on the Source of Origin; and (ii) closing the banner, surfing on the home page or clicking whatever element on the home page outside the banner, data subjects are giving their Consent to the use of cookies.
In some cases, the Source of Origin may ask data subjects to give an explicit Consent to the storing of these cookies, for example by requesting them to click on a specific acceptance button.
For further information, please see the cookies policy of the Source of Origin.
==========
In the event that data subjects express their Consent to the use of profiling cookies in this way, the publisher of the Source of Origin may track their Consent by means of a specific technical cookie.
In this way, the publisher of the Source or Origin will avoid data subjects displaying the cookies banner during their following visits of the Source of Origin.
Please take into account that, in the event data subjects remove from their browsers such technical cookie with the modalities set forth under Section 5.3(a) above, the track of data subjects’ Consent would be lost and, therefore, the cookies banner will be displayed again during their following visit to the Source of Origin.
Data subjects are clearly free to block the installation of profiling cookies in any moment whatsoever and this will not compromise in any manner whatsoever the possibility to visit the Source of Origin and benefit of its contents.
Where Consent is withdrawn, we have set out (above) how this may be undertaken by the data subject.

Personal data will be processed in accordance with specified purposes and subject to the principles set out in Article 5 GDPR.
Please note that we will process data subjects’ personal data with electronic instruments only, in a much-automatized manner and without any human intermediation.
Myntelligence uses pseudonymization technology which makes it impossible to isolate the data subject, nor identify personal data (within the cumulative data it aggregates).
Therefore, our employees and co-workers will never access the content of data subjects’ personal data obtained by means of cookies, meaning that they will never be able to see and/or have any direct Personally Identifiable Information (PII), that is information from which it will be possible to identify data subjects directly.
Certain employees of ours and co-workers, appointed by us as persons in charge of the processing, could make maintenance operations on IT systems that host data subjects’ personal data, without the possibility to access their actual contents.
==========
The personal data could be memorised on servers managed by third parties (for example, providers of IT systems) or may be managed by online marketing specialised subjects, acting as external data processors on the basis of a specific written appointment by Myntelligence.
Moreover, Myntelligence has introduced privacy by design for the personal data, which is processed by Myntelligence, respecting all relevant facets of the Regulation.
This is consistent with the accountability requirement under Articles 24 and 25 GDPR, including recourse to the privacy enhancing technology which is highly protective.
As an aside, please note, Myntelligence is ISO27001 certified.
==========
Myntelligence hereby informs data subjects that, complying with the requirements and the guarantees provided under the Regulation, data subjects’ personal data could be transferred to countries outside the European Union that could not guarantee a level of privacy and personal data protection equal to the level of protection guaranteed by the Regulation, but as data controller Myntelligence takes the utmost account of the right to security and protection of personal data of data subjects, therefore Myntelligence will process such transfers with all due care and guarantees.
Data subjects’ personal data will not be transferred to third parties, nor will be disseminated.
Data subjects’ personal data will be kept for the time strictly necessary to carry out the primary purposes described in this Products Privacy Policy, or in any case as necessary for the protection of the rights of both the interests of both users and Myntelligence.
Unless Myntelligence is required to retain certain personal data in accordance with the law, such as information needed for income tax and audit purposes, Myntelligence will not keep personal data for more than 24 months after initial processing.
==========
How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept may also be governed by specific business-sector requirements and agreed practices.
Personal data may be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.

WHAT COOKIES ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE FOR
Cookies are small text files that the websites visited by a data subject send directly to its terminal (usually, to the browser), where they are memorised to be transmitted to the same websites at the following visit of the same by the same data subject (so-called «first part cookies»).
During the web surfing of a website, a data subject may receive on its terminal also cookies of other websites or of other web servers (so called «third-party cookies»); this happens because there may be elements on the visited website, such as images, maps, sounds, links to specific web pages of other domains that are on servers other than the server on which the requested page is placed.
In other words, such cookies are set up on a website other than the one that is currently visited.
Cookies may have a duration limited to a single session of navigation on the browser (so-called «session cookies»), and, in such event, they deactivate automatically once the browser is closed by the data subject; or may have a predetermined duration and, in such event, they will remain memorised and active on data subject’s hard disk until the expiry date, thus continuing collecting information during different sessions of navigation on the browser (so-called «permanent cookies»).
==========
Cookies are used for several purposes.
Certain cookies are necessary in order to allow data subjects to surf websites and benefit of their functionalities (so-called «technical cookies»).
Other cookies are used in order to obtain statistical information, whether in aggregate or not, about the number of data subjects accessing the websites and how the websites are used (so-called «monitoring cookies» or «analytics»).
To the end, other cookies are used in order to track data subjects’ consumer profile and make data subjects viewing advertisings that may be of interest for them, since complying with their preferences and consumer habits (so-called «profiling cookies»).
In order to know more in details such different categories of cookies please continue reading this Cookies Policy.
Please discover how they works and for what use they are for and choose freely if you want to consent to their use or prevent the same.
C. TECHNICAL COOKIES
Technical cookies are used on the Website for the sole purpose to make you able to surf the Website and allow you to use its functionalities.
==========
They are first-party cookies since they are conveyed directly by us on the Website.
Certain technical cookies are essential to offer you an optimal surfing experience or in order to allow you to authenticate on the Website (e.g. in order to enter into your reserved area, etc.) (so-called «surfing cookies»).
Surfing cookies are normally session cookies and, therefore, once the surfing browser is closed, are automatically deactivated.
Technical cookies are useful in order to allow you to memorise your preferences (e.g. the language or the country, etc.) without setting up the same at the following visits (so-called «functionality cookies»).
For such reason, functionalities cookies are often lasting cookies, since they remain memorised on your computer also after the closure of the surfing browser, until the scheduled expiry date or until when you decide to eliminate the same.
==========
The table below describes technical cookies actually used on the Website:
Cookie’s denomination
Cookie’s category
Cookie’s function
cookie_notice_accepted

Analytics cookies on the Website are third-party cookies, since they are not conveyed directly by us and are not installed directly by Myntelligence but by third parties, acting as autonomous controllers.
The table below contains a list of such third parties together with a link to their policies:
Certain third-party analytics cookies are installed on the Website without your prior consent, because they are less invasive since anonymised, given that third parties cannot access to analytics disaggregated data at the IP address level (in other words, by using these cookies third parties cannot go back to your identity).
To the contrary, other third-party analytics cookies may be installed on the Website with your prior consent, since the same are not anonymised, given that third parties can access to analytics disaggregated data at the IP address level (in other words, using these cookies, third parties could theoretically go back to your identity by means of the IP address).

In the event that you express your consent to the use of cookies in this way, we will track your consent by means of a specific technical cookie.
==========
In this way, we will avoid you displaying the cookies’ banner during your following visits of the Website.
Please take into account that, in the event that you remove from your browser such technical cookie with the modalities set forth under Section F below, the track of your consent would be lost and, therefore, the cookies’ banner will be displayed again during your following visit to the Website.
You are clearly free to block the installation of analytics cookies in any moment and this will not compromise in any manner whatsoever the possibility to visit the Website and benefit of its contents.
Please read carefully the third parties’ policies by using the links specified in the table above in order to know how to do it.
