Privacy Philosophy
The information provided in this Visitor Privacy Policy covers your interactions on the different areas of the InfoSpace Web site referenced above (excludes the co-branded pages of our partners and affiliates).
As a company, InfoSpace believes strongly in protecting consumer privacy, and it is InfoSpace's goal to allow our visitors to provide as much or as little information as they feel comfortable.
Information Gathered
InfoSpace gathers information about our visitors that allows us to offer compelling and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well.
Occasionally we ask you to provide us certain personal information such as your name, email address, or a list of your interests and hobbies.
You never have to answer these questions, although not answering them may limit the services that we can offer you.
==========
On certain pages, credit card numbers are collected in order to conduct a transaction.
We utilize a third party to process your credit card transaction.
In order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), InfoSpace does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.
In order to provide you with a personalized experience and also monitor the traffic patterns on our site, InfoSpace uses a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to track content preferences and traffic patterns.
The cookie may contain a number or other information which reminds us who you are when you visit our site.
This browser feature is valuable to you because it alleviates the need to re-register for services each time you visit our site and because it allows us to better understand traffic patterns throughout our Web site (keep track of how often visitors visit a particular part of our site) so we can offer our visitors the most popular and useful content and services available.
You may choose not to accept cookies by changing the preferences on your browser.
However, your experience will be less personalized and, in addition, certain services may not be available for your use (See below, "Use of the Information").
Other companies that advertise on our site also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you.
You may choose not to accept such cookies by changing the preferences on your browser.
==========
To find out which advertising firms InfoSpace uses from time to time, see our list of Advertising Partners.
Although you may visit our site anonymously, you may elect to provide us with information you want InfoSpace to remember.
We hope that you will want to provide information about yourself to InfoSpace because it will make our Web site more valuable to you.
If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer to anonymous users.
One example of where we collect personal information to serve you better is the My InfoSpace section of our Web site where we collect information to provide you with stock quotes, weather, and lottery results.
Our Chat Rooms are another example of such an enhanced service.
In these instances, we retain information about you between sessions by using the cookies described above.
From time to time, InfoSpace will conduct surveys in order to help serve you better.
Participation in the surveys is optional and anonymous.
==========
Use of the Information
InfoSpace always tries to provide you with a compelling reason to come back and visit our site again:
We use the information gathered from you to provide personalized portions of our site that are intended to provide just the information you are interested in receiving.
My InfoSpace is a good example of such a personalized service.
We analyze what our customers like and don't like about InfoSpace's current offerings so that we can design better services.
We use information about what you are searching for to help focus our energies on the services that we offer, hopefully to make them more valuable to you.
==========
We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers.
An example of a summary report might be "48,000 people clicked on Advertisement "X" today and, of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports."
The people that make it possible for you to use InfoSpace for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are.
Information Distribution
Other companies which place advertising or content on our site may collect information about you by way of cookies when you view or click on their advertising or content.
You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
To find out which advertising firms InfoSpace uses from time to time, see our list of Advertising Partners.
Refer to the section below for information on content providers.
On certain pages, credit card numbers are collected in order to conduct a transaction.
We utilize a third-party to process your credit card transaction.
==========
Additionally, although partners, affiliates and third parties may link to our Web site, or otherwise be associated with our Web site, InfoSpace cannot control the information collection and distribution policies of such parties.
Although we do encourage our partners and affiliates, including co-branding partners, to adopt privacy policies similar to this one, we do not have control over the practices of third parties and these practices may differ from our own.
You should check the privacy policy of every Web site you visit to ensure that you are comfortable with the practices of that particular Web site.
Content Providers
Almost all of the information and activities that are found on the various areas of the InfoSpace Web site are a result of content that is provided by our partners and associates.
==========
Since some of these activities involve inputting personal information, this is an issue that needs to be addressed in our Visitor Privacy Policy.
There are many instances where personal information that is entered is used by one of our content providers.
In these cases, the content provider receives any information that you provide, and that information is subject to the privacy policy of that provider.
An example of this process is signing up for our Real Time Quotes service.
Although the sign-up process is done while never leaving the InfoSpace Web site, the information that is gathered goes to freerealtime.com, and is subject to the Privacy Policy of that organization.
==========
Some of our other content providers may include from time to time, but are not limited to:
One & Only Photo Personals
Match.com
ebay
Leisure Planet
Astrology.net
1-800 US Search

InfoSpace may send administrative emails to confirm user registrations or to update users concerning new services or opportunities with InfoSpace.
Some of these emails may contain information about the services of our partners.
We may send out promotional emails on behalf of our partners to those users who have demonstrated an interest in receiving such solicitations.
==========
Chat and Message Board Disclaimer
Information that you disclose about yourself in a public chat room, message board or other public forum will immediately become available to anyone who has access to those public areas.
