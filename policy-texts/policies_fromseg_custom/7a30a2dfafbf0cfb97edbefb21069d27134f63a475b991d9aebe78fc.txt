Service Agreement:
         The Service Agreement is provided to you at activation.
There are several parts to the Service Agreement, including, but not 
        limited to, the Subscriber Agreement you sign or accept, the detailed plan or other information on Services we provide or refer you 
        to during the sales transaction, and any confirmation materials we may provide you.
General Terms:
         If you agree to maintain service for a minimum Term, the Term begins when you accept the Subscriber Agreement (e.g., 
        signature, activate service, use phone, etc.).
==========
You may terminate any line of service before its Term ends by calling us, however 
        you will be responsible for an EARLY TERMINATION FEE of up to $350/line for Advanced Devices & up to $200 ETF/line for other 
        devices for each line/number terminated early — except for terminations consistent with our return policy.
The ETF is prorated 
        and is calculated by taking the months remaining on your Service Agreement times $20 for Advanced Devices, with a maximum of $350, 
        and minimum of $100.
For all other devices, the prorated ETF is calculated by taking the months remaining multiplied by $10 with a 
        maximum of $200 and minimum of $50.
Payment of the ETF does not satisfy other obligations owed to us, including Term commitments 
        with other lines or service/equipment charges.
==========
If you agree to maintain service for a minimum Term, upon expiration of the Term, 
        this Agreement will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis unless you contact us to inform us of any changes, including 
        cancellation.
If there is no minimum Term associated with the service plan you elect, this Agreement will apply and automatically 
        continue on a month-to-month basis unless you contact us to inform us of any changes, including cancellation.
==========
We reserve the right 
        to cancel offers early or extend offers without notice.
Offers are subject to credit approval.

An account spending limit may apply 
        — ask for specific amount.
Spending limit accounts are subject to a fee of $7.99/mo. per account.
The fee will be waived for 
        accounts enrolled in recurring AutoPay and electronic billing (eBill).
Monthly service plan charges accrue even if your service is 
        turned off for exceeding your spending limit or non-payment.
==========
If payment is not received in full by the due date on your bill, late 
        fees may be assessed, in amounts up to the maximum amount permitted by law in the state of your billing address.
A detailed bill 
        provides comprehensive call details to customers, including, phone numbers dialed and received, call lengths, call types and call 
        times.
A $1.99/mo. per account fee will apply if you choose to receive a paper invoice with detailed billing.
To avoid this fee, 
        you can elect to receive Sprint's ebill or summary format of the paper invoice.
Detailed billing information is available for all 
        customers by visiting your Sprint account online.

New Agreements on the Sprint 4G (WiMAX) Network:
         Your Service on a device activated on the Sprint 4G (WiMAX) Network may require a new one or two-year Agreement per line.
Sprint expressly reserves the right to migrate your Service during this Agreement term from the Sprint 4G (WiMAX) Network to the 
        Sprint 4G LTE network to complete your Agreement term.
Reasonable advance notice of the Service change will be provided to impacted 
        customers, who can then select one of the following options: (a) Choose to complete the Agreement term using your existing device 
        without 4G (WiMAX) capability (b) Elect to complete the Agreement term by contacting us after receiving notice from Sprint to 
        transition to the Sprint 4G LTE network with no additional term commitment required (Transition Option)(c) Deactivate service.
Deactivations because of this Service change will not result in an Early Termination Fee (ETF).
Transition Option: If you select 
        the Transition Option, you will receive a free standard Sprint LTE capable device and can maintain your existing Service plan, if 
        available.
During the Agreement term, Sprint may provide other offers that are separate from the Transition Option, and these 
        offers will be subject to a new two-year Agreement per line.

    either modify or replace certain provisions in these Ts&Cs;, including terms relating to activation, invoicing, payment, and disputing 
    charges.
Also, a different dispute resolution provision may apply to services provided by another company (the dispute resolution 
    provisions in this Agreement will still apply to our Services).
You will be provided details on any additional terms with your 
    selection of any bundled Service.
==========
For employee and organization discounts, the discount percentage may vary from month-to-month based 
    on the terms of the agreement between your employer, association, or organization and Sprint.
The discount will be zero after your 
    agreement or your organization's agreement with Sprint ends.
Additional terms and eligibility requirements regarding organization 
    discounts will be provided to you.
==========
Our Policies


	Services are subject to our business policies, practices, and procedures ("Policies").
You agree to adhere to all of our Policies when 
    you use our Services.
Our Policies are subject to change at anytime with or without notice.
==========
When You Accept The Agreement


	You must have the legal capacity to accept the Agreement.
You accept the Agreement when you do any of the following: (a) accept the 
    Agreement through any printed, oral, or electronic statement, including on the web by electronically marking that you have reviewed and 
    accepted; (b) attempt to or in any way use the Services; (c) pay for the Services; or (d) open any package or start any program that 
    says you are accepting the Agreement when doing so.
If you don't want to accept the Agreement, don't do any of 
    these things.
==========
Term Commitments & Early Termination Fees


	Sprint provides a variety of Services, some of which require you to maintain Your Services on a month to month basis or for a minimum 
    term, usually 1 or 2 years ("Term Commitment").
If your Agreement contains a Term Commitment, you will be 
    charged a fee ("Early Termination Fee") for each line of Service that you terminate early (i.e., prior to satisfying the Term 
    Commitment) or for each line of Service that we terminate early for good reason (for example, violating the payment or other terms of 
    the Agreement) but such Early Termination Fee will be prorated based on your remaining Term Commitment.
Early Termination Fees 
    are a part of our rates.
Any Term Commitment, the length of the Term Commitment, and the applicable Early Termination Fee amounts and 
    proration will be disclosed to you during the sales transaction.
Carefully review any Term Commitment and 
    Early Termination Fee requirements prior to selecting Services.
==========
After you have satisfied your Term Commitment, your Services continue 
    on a month-to-month basis under the then-current Terms and Conditions and Service policies.
Services offered on a subscription 
    basis, as described in the "Account & Service Charges" section, may not require a Term Commitment and may not automatically renew.
==========
As 
    explained directly below, there are instances when you will not be responsible for an Early Termination Fee for terminating Services 
    early.
When You Don't Have To Pay An Early Termination Fee


	You aren't responsible for paying an Early Termination Fee when terminating Services: (a) provided on a month-to-month basis; (b) 
    provided on a subscription basis that do not include a Term Commitment; (c) consistent with our published trial period return policy; 
    or (d) in response to a materially adverse change that we make to the Agreement as described directly below.
Our Right To Change The Agreement & Your Related Rights


	We may change any part of the Agreement at any time, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, how we calculate charges, discounts, 
    coverage, technologies used to provide services, or your terms of Service.
If you lose your eligibility for a particular rate plan or 
    if a particular rate plan is no longer supported or available, we may change your rate plan to one for which you qualify.
==========
We will 
    provide you notice of material changes—and we may provide you notice of non-material changes—in a manner consistent with 
    this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section).
If a change we make to the Agreement is material and 
    has a material adverse effect on Services under your Term Commitment, you may terminate each line of Service materially adversely 
    affected without incurring an Early Termination Fee only if: (a) call us within 30 days after the effective date of the change; (b) you 
    specifically advise us that you wish to cancel Services because of a material change to the Agreement that we have made; and (c) we 
    fail to negate the change after you notify us of your objection to it.
If you do not notify us and cancel Service within 30 days 
    of the change, an Early Termination Fee will apply if you terminate Services before the end of any applicable Term Commitment.
Our Right To Suspend Or Terminate Services


	We can, without notice, suspend or terminate any Service at any time for any reason.
For example, we can suspend or terminate 
    any Service for the following: (a) late payment; (b) exceeding an Account Spending Limit; (c) harassing/threatening/abusing/offending 
    our employees or agents; (d) providing false or inaccurate information; (e) interfering with our operations; (f) using/suspicion of 
    using Services in any manner restricted by or inconsistent with the Agreement and Policies; (g) breaching, failing to follow, or 
    abusing the Agreement or Policies; (h) providing false, inaccurate, dated, or unverifiable identification or credit information or 
    becoming insolvent or bankrupt; (i) modifying a Device from its manufacturer specifications (for example, rooting the device); (j) 
    failing to use our Services for an extended period of time; (k) failing to maintain an active Device in connection with our Services; 
    or (l) if we believe the action protects our interests, any customer's interests, or our networks.
Your Right To Change Services & When Changes Are Effective


	The account holder can typically change Services upon request.
In some instances, changes may be conditioned on payment of an Early 
    Termination Fee or certain other charges, or they may require a new Term Commitment.
==========
Changes to Services are usually effective at the 
    start of the next full invoicing cycle.
If the changes take place sooner, your invoice may reflect pro-rated charges for your old and 
    new Services.
==========
We may, but are not obligated to, provide you the opportunity to authorize someone else to make changes to your Services, 
    which will include the authority to make changes that will extend your Term Commitment.
You are responsible for any changes to your 
    Services made by a person you authorize, and those changes will be treated as modifications to this Agreement.
==========
Your Right To Terminate Services


	You can terminate Services at any time by calling us and requesting that we deactivate all Services.
In addition, if you return or 
    provide your Device to Sprint and fail to either deactivate service on the Device or activate another Device in connection with your 
    Service, we reserve the right to terminate your Service, and if you are subject to a Term Commitment, you may be charged all or part of 
    an Early Termination Fee.
You are responsible for all charges billed or incurred prior to deactivation.
==========
If Services are terminated 
    before the end of your invoicing cycle, we won't prorate charges to the date of termination and you won't receive a credit or refund 
    for any unused Services.
Except as provided above, if you are subject to an Early Termination Fee, you must 
    also pay the invoiced Early Termination Fee for each line of Service that you terminate early.
==========
Credit Checks & Credit Information


	We agree to provide you Services on the condition that you have and maintain satisfactory credit according to our standards and 
    policies.
You agree to provide information that we may request or complete any applications that we may provide you to facilitate our 
    review.
We rely on the credit information you furnish, credit bureau reports or other data available from commercial credit reference 
    services, and other information (such as payment history with us) to determine whether to provide or continue to provide you Services.
==========
The Services we offer you can vary based on your credit history.
We may at any time, based on your credit history, withdraw or change 
    Services or place limits or conditions on the use of our Services.
==========
You agree to provide us updated credit information upon request.
We 
    may provide your payment history and other account billing/charge information to any credit reporting agency or industry clearinghouse.
==========
Account Spending Limits ("ASL")


	An ASL is a temporary or permanent limit (typically based on credit history, payment history, or to prevent fraud) that we place on the 
    amount of unpaid charges you can accumulate on your account, regardless of when payment on those charges is due.
We reserve the right 
    to determine which charges count toward an ASL.
If you have an ASL, we may suspend your Services without prior notice if your account 
    balance reaches the ASL, even if your account is not past due.
We may impose or increase an ASL at any time with notice.
An ASL is for 
    our benefit only and should not be relied on by you to manage usage.
==========
Deposits & Returning Deposits


	We may at any time require a deposit as a guarantee of payment for you to establish or maintain Service ("Deposit").
By providing us a 
    Deposit, you grant us a security interest for all current or future amounts owed to us.
==========
We may change the Deposit at any time with 
    notice.
You can't use a Deposit to make or delay payments.
==========
The Deposit, the length of time we hold the Deposit, and changes to the 
    Deposit are determined based on your credit history, payment history, and other factors.
Unless prohibited by law, we may mix Deposits 
    with our other funds and it won't earn interest, and we reserve the right to return the Deposit as a credit on your invoice at anytime.
If your Services are terminated for any reason, we may keep and apply your Deposit to any outstanding charges.
We'll send any remaining 
    portion of the Deposit to your last known address within 90 days after your final invoice—if it is returned to us, we will 
    forward it on to the appropriate state authorities to the extent required by law.
==========
Restrictions On Using Services


	You can't use our Services: (a) in a way that could cause damage or adversely affect any of our other customers or our reputation, 
    networks, property, or Services; or (b) in any way prohibited by the terms of our Services, the Agreement, or our Policies.
You cannot 
    in any manner resell the Services to another party.
For additional restrictions on the use of our Services, see our Acceptable Use 
    Policy and Visitors Agreement, which are available on our website, and the detailed plan or other information on Services that we 
    provide or refer you to during the sales transaction.
==========
Your Device, Number, & E-mail Address


	We don't manufacture any Device that we might sell to you or that is associated with our Services, and we aren't responsible for 
    any defects, acts, or omissions of the manufacturer.
The only warranties on your Device are the limited 
    warranties given to you by the manufacturer directly or that we pass through.
Device performance may vary based on device 
    specifications (for example, a device's software, memory, and storage), and device performance may impact access to all of our 
    Services.
Your Device is designed to be activated on our networks and in other coverage areas that we may make available to you.
==========
As programmed, it will not accept wireless service from another carrier.
Except for any legal right you may have to port/transfer your 
    phone number to another carrier, you have no—and cannot gain any (for example, through publication, use, etc.)—proprietary, 
    ownership, or other rights to any phone number, identification number, e-mail address, or other identifier that we assign to you, your 
    Device, or your account.
We'll notify you if we decide to change or reassign them.
==========
Your CDMA Sprint PCS phone may have software 
    programming lock that protects certain of the handset's operating parameters against unauthorized reprogramming.
If your device has a 
    software programming lock, and you wish to obtain the software program lock code for your CDMA Sprint PCS phone, please visit 
    Sprint.com or call 1-888-211-4727 for information and eligibility requirements.
==========
Porting/Transferring Phone Numbers


	We don't guarantee that number transfers to or from us will be successful.
If you authorize another carrier to transfer a number away 
    from us, then that is considered a request by you to us to terminate all of the Services associated with that number.
You're responsible for all charges billed or incurred prior to deactivation and for any applicable Early 
    Termination Fees.
==========
Coverage; Where Your Device Will Work; Service Speeds


	Our coverage maps are available at our authorized retail locations and on sprint.com.
The specific network coverage you get will depend 
    on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and Services you've chosen.
Our coverage maps provide high 
    level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions.
==========
Coverage isn't available everywhere.
Coverage and Service speeds are not guaranteed.
Coverage is subject to change without notice.
Service speeds may depend on the Service 
    purchased.
Actual speeds will vary.
==========
Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength, and Service speed is not an exact science.
There are 
    gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that—along with other factors both within and beyond our control (for 
    example, network problems, network or internet congestion, software, signal strength, your Device, structures, buildings, weather, 
    geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access, actions of third parties, etc.)—may result in dropped and 
    blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service.
Services that rely on location information, 
    such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your Device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and 
    network coverage.
==========
While your Device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the 
    software update is complete.
Roaming


	The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements 
    with other carriers.
These agreements may change from time to time, and roaming coverage is subject to change without notice.
Your 
    ability to receive roaming coverage depends on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and the availability of roaming 
    coverage.
==========
We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available.
Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network 
    coverage areas.
Your Device will generally indicate when you're roaming.
==========
Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the 
    amount of minutes used while roaming may apply.
Certain Services may not be available or work the same when roaming (for example, data 
    Services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.).
For information on whether roaming applies, see your service plan details.
==========
About Data Services & Content


	Our data Services and your Device may allow you to access the internet, text, pictures, video, games, graphics, music, email, 
    applications, sound, and other materials ("Data Content") or send Data Content elsewhere.
Some Data Content is available from us or our 
    vendors, while other Data Content can be accessed from others (for example, third party websites, games, ringers, applications, etc.).
==========
We make absolutely no guarantees about the Data Content that you access on your Device.
Data Content may be: 
    (1) unsuitable for children/minors; (2) unreliable or inaccurate; or (3) offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
You're solely 
    responsible for evaluating the Data Content accessed by you or anyone through your Services.
We strongly recommend that you monitor 
    data usage by children/minors.
==========
Data Content from third parties may also harm your Device or its software.
We are not responsible 
    for any Data Content.
We are not responsible for any damage caused by any Data Content that you access through your Services, that you 
    load on your Device, or that you request that our representatives access or load on your Device.
To protect our networks and Services 
    or for other reasons, we may place restrictions on accessing certain Data Content (such as certain websites, applications, etc.); 
    impose separate charges; limit throughput or the amount of data that you can transfer; or otherwise limit or terminate Services.
If we 
    provide you storage for Data Content that you have purchased, then we may delete the Data Content without notice or place 
    restrictions/limits on the use of storage areas.
Data Content stored on a Device, transmitted over our networks, or stored by Sprint 
    may be deleted, modified, or damaged.
You may not be able to make or receive voice calls while using data Services.
Data Content 
    provided by our vendors or third parties is subject to cancellation or termination at any time without notice to you, and you may not 
    receive a refund for any unused portion of the Data Content.
Specific Terms & Restrictions On Using Data Services


	In addition to the rules for using all of our other Services, unless we identify the Service or Device that you have selected as 
    specifically intended for that purpose (for example, wireless routers, Data Link, etc.), you can't use our data Services: (1) with 
    server devices or host computer applications or other systems that drive continuous, heavy traffic or data sessions; (2) as a 
    substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections; or (3) for any other unintended use as we determine in our sole 
    discretion.
We reserve the right to limit, suspend, or constrain any heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our networks 
    performances or hinders access to our networks.
==========
If your Services include web or data access, you also can't use your Device as a modem 
    for computers or other equipment, unless we identify the Service or Device you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose 
    (for example, with "phone as modem" plans, Sprint Mobile Broadband card plans, wireless router plans, etc.).
Software License


	If Sprint provides you software as part of the Service and there are not software license terms provided with the software (by Sprint 
    or by a third party), then Sprint grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the software to 
    access the Services for your own individual use.
You will not sell, resell, transfer, copy, translate, publish, create derivative works 
    of, make any commercial use of, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software.
Sprint may revoke this license at any 
    time.
==========
Fees, Activation & Miscellaneous Charges


	Based on our Policies, we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain 
    Services.
Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset 
    upgrades, etc.).
You will be provided notice of these types of fees before we complete the requested transaction.
==========
Account & Service Charges


You are responsible for all charges associated with your account and the Services on your account, no matter 
    who adds or uses the Services.
Charges include, but are not limited to, the monthly recurring charges, usage charges, charges 
    for additional services, taxes, surcharges, and fees associated with your Services.
These charges are described or referred to during 
    the sales transaction, in our marketing materials, and in confirmation materials that we may send to you.
==========
Depending on your Services, 
    charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, and web 
    access.
If you (the account holder) allow end users to access or use your Devices, you authorize end users to access, download, and use 
    Services.
You may have the opportunity to purchase Services on a subscription basis where we assess subscription charges that allow you 
    access to the Services and/or provide you a certain amount of use of the Services for a defined period of time.
Depending on your 
    Service, certain types of subscription charges may be assessed automatically upon activation and automatically assessed for subsequent 
    subscription periods.
==========
Subscription Services offered on a recurring basis do not end until terminated by you or us.
Subscription charges 
    for recurring Services occur at the beginning of each bill cycle.
Information regarding your bill cycle for subscription Services will 
    be provided when you order the Services.
For Services offered on a per-day basis, you will generally be charged for use before or at 
    the time of use.
In certain instances, we may charge you at some point after you use the Services.
Unless otherwise disclosed, Services 
    offered on a per-day basis end 24 hours after Service is initiated.
How We Calculate Your Charges For Billing Purposes


Regular Voice Calls: We round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute.
==========
Time starts when you 
    press "Talk" or your Device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks.
You're 
    charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services.
==========
You won't be charged for 
    unanswered calls or if you get a busy signal.
For incoming calls answered, you're charged from the time shortly before the Device 
    starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks.
If charges vary depending on the time of day that you 
    place or receive calls (for example, Nights and Weekend plans), you're charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to 
    the time period in which the call starts.
==========
Call time for a single call may be subject to a maximum duration and may be automatically 
    terminated if the maximum duration is exceeded.
Rates that vary based on the time of access will be determined based on the location of 
    the network equipment providing service and not the location of your Device or your Device's area code (if applicable).
==========
Push-to-Talk Charges: Charges for push-to-talk calls are billed to the person who starts the call and 
    calculated by multiplying the duration of the call by the applicable rate and number of participants.
You're charged at least 6 seconds 
    of airtime for each call you start; subsequent communications in the same call are rounded up to and billed to the next second.
Time 
    begins when you press any button to start a push-to-talk call and ends approximately 6 seconds after completion of a communication to 
    which no participant responds.
Subsequent push-to-talk communications are considered new calls.
Charges apply for the entire period of 
    time the push-to-talk call is connected to our network.
Depending on your plan, nationwide, international, or group push-to-talk calls 
    may use the local push-to-talk minutes in your plan and result in different charges.
Responses to call alert transmissions are treated 
    as new push-to-talk transmissions even when responding within 6 seconds of receiving the alert.
Push-to-talk  billing methods are 
    subject to change as we introduce new push-to-talk Services.
==========
Data Usage: Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured in bytes, kilobytes, 
    megabytes, and gigabytes—not in minutes/time.
1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes 
    equals 1 gigabyte.
Bytes are rounded up to KB, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session").
Rounding occurs at the end of each data session, and sometimes during a data session.
Depending on your data Services, usage may be 
    charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage.
If you are 
    charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to the next cent.
==========
You are charged for all data directed to 
    your Device's internet address, including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers.
As long as your Device is 
    connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges.
Examples of data for which you will be charged includes the size of a 
    requested file or Data Content (game, ringer, etc.); Web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.); additional data 
    used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network; data from partial or interrupted downloads; re-sent data; and 
    data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications.
These data charges are in addition to any charges for 
    the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.).
Data used and charged to you will vary widely, even between identical actions or data 
    sessions.
Estimates of data usage—for example, the size of downloadable files—are not reliable predictors of actual usage.
Your bill won't separately list the number of KB attributed to a specific action/data session.
==========
Your Bill


	Your bill provides you notice of your charges.
It reflects monthly recurring charges (usually billed one bill cycle in advance), fees, 
    taxes, Surcharges, product and equipment charges, subscription charges, and usage/transaction specific charges (usually billed in the 
    bill cycle in which they're incurred).
Some usage charges, such as those that depend on usage information from a third party, may be 
    billed in subsequent bill cycles and result in higher than expected charges for that month.
==========
Bill cycles and dates may change from time 
    to time.
Your bill may also include other important notices (for example, changes to your Agreement, to your 
    Service, legal notices, etc.).
==========
Your paper bill may not include itemized billing detail.
More specific billing information is 
    available online.
Paper bills may be subject to an additional charge.
==========
Unless prohibited by law, other charges (for example, data 
    Services or taxes and surcharges) will not include itemized detail but will be listed as total charges for a category.
If you choose 
    internet billing, you will not receive paper bills.
Your Payments; Late Fees


	Payment is due in full as stated on your bill.
If we do not receive payment in full by the date specified on your bill, a late payment 
    charge, which may be charged at the highest rate permissible by law, may be applied to the total unpaid balance.
We may also charge you 
    any costs we pay to a collection agency to collect unpaid balances from you.
If we bill you for amounts on behalf of a third party, 
    payments received are first applied to our charges.
You may be charged additional fees for certain methods of payment.
We may charge 
    you, up to the highest amount permitted by law, for returned checks or other payments paid by you and denied for any reason by a 
    financial institution.
Acceptance of payments (even if marked "paid in full") does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you 
    owe us.
We may restrict your payment methods to cashier's check, money order, or other similar secure form of payment at any time for 
    good reason.
Taxes & Government Fees


	You agree to pay all federal, state, and local taxes, fees, and other assessments that we're required by law to collect and remit to 
    the government on the Services that we provide to you.
These charges may change from time to time without advance notice.
==========
If you're 
    claiming any tax exemption, you must provide us with a valid exemption certificate.
Tax exemptions generally won't be applied 
    retroactively.
==========
Surcharges


	You agree to pay all Sprint surcharges ("Surcharges"), which may include, but are not limited to: Federal Universal Service; Regulatory 
    and Administrative charges; gross receipts charges, and other charges.
Surcharges are not taxes, and we are 
    not required by law to assess them.
==========
They are part of our rates we choose at our discretion, to collect from you, to recover certain 
    costs and are kept by us.
The number and type of Surcharges will be provided on your invoice and may vary depending upon the location 
    of the billing address of the Device and can change over time.
==========
We determine the amount for these charges, and these amounts are subject 
    to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts.
We will provide you notice of any changes to Surcharges in a 
    manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section).
However, because some 
    Surcharges are based on amounts set by the government or based on government formulas, it will not always be possible to provide 
    advance notice of new Surcharges or changes in the amount of existing Surcharges.
Information on Surcharges is provided during the 
    sales transaction and is available on our website.
==========
Disputing Charges - You Must Still Pay Undisputed Charges


	Any dispute to a charge on your bill must be made within 60 days of the date of the bill that initially contained the charge.
Disputes 
    can only be made by calling or writing us as directed on your invoice or elsewhere.
You accept all charges not properly disputed within 
    the above time period—undisputed charges must still be paid as stated on your bill.
==========
Protecting Our Networks & Services


	We can take any action to: (1) protect our networks, our rights and interests, or the rights of others; or (2) optimize or improve the 
    overall use of our networks and Services.
Some of these actions may interrupt or prevent legitimate communications and usage—for 
    example, message filtering/blocking software to prevent spam or viruses; limiting throughput; limiting access to certain websites, 
    applications, or other Data Content; prohibitions on unintended uses (for example, use as a dedicated line, or use as a monitoring 
    service), etc.
==========
For additional information on what we do to protect our customers, networks, Services, and equipment, see our Acceptable 
    Use Policy and Visitors Agreement at our website.
Your Privacy


	Our Privacy Policy is available on our website.
To review the policy, visit 
    sprint.com/legal/privacy.html.
This policy may change from time to time, so 
    review it with regularity and care.
==========
Call Monitoring: To ensure the quality of our Services and for other lawful purposes, we may monitor or 
    record calls you make to us or we make to you (for example, your conversations with our customer service or sales departments).
Authentication and Contact: You (the account holder) may password protect your account information by 
    establishing a personal identification number ("PIN").
You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget 
    your PIN.
You agree to protect your PIN, passwords, and other account access credentials like your backup security question from loss 
    or disclosure.
You further agree that Sprint may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials that we deem 
    sufficient for account access as you or an authorized user on the account for disclosure of information or changes in Service.
==========
You 
    agree that we may contact you for Service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the Services or 
    Devices to which you subscribe, or through other available means, including text message, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, 
    residential or business phone, or mail.
CPNI: As we provide telecommunications products and Services to you (the account holder), we develop 
    information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location, and destination of telecommunications products and Services 
    you use, as well as some other information found on your bill ("CPNI").
==========
Under federal law, you have the right and we have a duty to 
    protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.
For example, we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including 
    authentication procedures when you contact us.
For some accounts with a dedicated Sprint representative, we may rely on contacting your 
    pre-established point of contact as the standard authentication measure.
==========
Third-Party Applications: If you use a third-party application, the application may access, collect, 
    use, or disclose your personal information or require Sprint to disclose your information—including location information (when 
    applicable)—to the application provider or some other third party.
If you access, use, or authorize third-party applications 
    through the Services, you agree and authorize Sprint to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s).
You understand that your use of third-party applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and policies, including 
    its privacy policy.
Be sure that you have reviewed and are comfortable with the third party's policies before using its application on 
    your device.
==========
Information on Devices: Your Device may contain sensitive or personal information (for example, 
    pictures, videos, passwords, or stored credit card numbers).
Sprint is not responsible for any information on your Device, including 
    sensitive or personal information.
If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when 
    your Device is out of your possession or control, for example when you relinquish, exchange, return, or recycle your Device.
By 
    submitting your Device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on your Device.
If you exchange, return, or recycle your Device through us, we typically attempt to erase all data on your Device, but you must remove 
    all data from your Device before you provide it to us.
==========
Location-Enabled Services


	Our networks generally know the location of your Device when it is outdoors and/or turned on.
By using various technologies to locate 
    your Device, we can provide enhanced emergency 911 services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third party.
Network coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather, geography, landscape, and topography) can 
    significantly impact the ability to access your Device's location information and use of location-enabled services.
==========
You agree that any authorized user may access, use, or authorize Sprint or third party location-enabled applications through the 
    Services.
You understand that your use of such location-enabled applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and 
    policies, including its privacy policy.
If you activate location-enabled services for devices used by other authorized users, you agree 
    to inform the authorized user(s) of the terms of use for location-enabled applications and that the Device may be located.
==========
911 Or Other Emergency Calls


Public safety officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, you should always be prepared to 
    provide your location information.
Unlike traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether 
    your Device is GPS enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 
    operators may not know your phone number, your location, or the location of your Device.
In certain circumstances, an emergency call 
    may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers.
Enhanced 911 service 
    ("E911")—where enabled by local emergency authorities—uses GPS technology to provide location information.
Even when 
    available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information.
If your Device is indoors or for some other reason 
    cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located.
Some Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after 
    dialing 911—you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing interactive voice 
    response systems to screen calls.
==========
If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen


	Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen because you may be responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the 
    alleged loss or theft.
A lost or stolen Device does not reduce or remove your Term Commitment.
You will remain liable for any monthly 
    recurring charges associated with the Service on your Device after you notify us of the alleged loss or theft.
==========
You agree to cooperate 
    if we choose to investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.).
We may not waive any applicable Early Termination Fees 
    if you choose to terminate Services as a result of loss or theft of your Device.
==========
Disclaimer of Warranties


	UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN WRITING OTHERWISE, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT 
    ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES 
    (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS ON YOUR DEVICE).
WE DON'T PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND 
    DON'T AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE WARRANTIES ON OUR BEHALF.
SPRINT PROVIDES ALL SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITH ALL 
    FAULTS, ERRORS, AND DEFECTS.
==========
You Agree That We Are Not Responsible For Certain Problems


	You agree that neither we nor our parent, subsidiary, or affiliate companies, nor our vendors, suppliers, or licensors are responsible 
    for any damages, delay, interruption or other failure to perform resulting from: (a) anything done or not done by someone else; (b) 
    providing or failing to provide Services, including, but not limited to, deficiencies or problems with a Device or network coverage 
    (for example, dropped, blocked, interrupted Services, etc.); (c) traffic or other accidents, or any health-related claims relating to 
    our Services; (d) Data Content or information accessed while using our Services; (e) an interruption or failure in accessing or 
    attempting to access emergency services from a Device, including through 911, Enhanced 911 or otherwise; (f) interrupted, failed, or 
    inaccurate location information services; (g) information or communication that is blocked by a spam filter; (h) damage to your Device 
    or any computer or equipment connected to your Device, or damage to or loss of any information stored on your Device, computer, 
    equipment, or Sprint storage space from your use of the Services or from viruses, worms, or downloads of malicious content, materials, 
    data, text, images, video, or audio; or (i) things beyond our control, including acts of God (for example, weather-related phenomena, 
    fire, earthquake, hurricane, etc.), riot, strike, war, terrorism, or government orders or acts.
You should implement appropriate 
    safeguards to secure your Device, computer, or equipment and to back-up your information stored on each.
==========
You Agree That Our Liability Is Limited - No Consequential Damages


	TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 
    THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AFFECTED PERIOD.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY 
    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDING OR 
    FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH A DEVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF 
    REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
==========
DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS


	In those rare instances where your concern is not resolved to your satisfaction through calls to our customer care, you and Sprint each 
    agree to try to resolve those disputes in good faith after you provide written notice of the dispute as set forth below.
If the dispute 
    is not resolved, you and Sprint agree that the dispute will be resolved through individual binding arbitration or small claims court, 
    instead of courts of general jurisdiction.
Mandatory Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action Instead of suing in court, you and Sprint agree to arbitrate all Disputes (as 
        defined below) on an individual, non-representative, basis.
You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Sprint are 
        waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative action.
==========
This agreement to arbitrate is 
        intended to be broadly interpreted.
In arbitration, there is no judge or jury.
==========
Instead Disputes are decided by a neutral third-party arbitrator in a more informal process 
    than in court.
In arbitration, there is limited discovery and the arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts.
However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms of the Agreement and can award damages and relief, including any 
    attorneys' fees authorized by law.
==========
"Disputes" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to or arising out 
    of in any way our Services or the Agreement, including, but not limited to, coverage, Devices, billing services and practices, 
    policies, contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, even if the claim arises after 
    Services have terminated.
Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of 
    the Services or Devices bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; (b) you bring against a third party, 
    such as a retailer or equipment manufacturer, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of in any way our Services or the Agreement; 
    or (c) that Sprint brings against you.
Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out 
    of any aspect of the relationship between you and Sprint, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, 
    advertising claims or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before this Agreement or out of a prior Agreement with Sprint; 
    (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after 
    the termination of this Agreement.
==========
Dispute Notice and Dispute Resolution Period


	Before initiating an arbitration or a small claims matter, you and Sprint each agree to first provide to the other a written notice 
    ("Notice of Dispute"), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting 
    information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought.
A Notice of Dispute to Sprint should be sent to: General Counsel; 
    Arbitration Office; 12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop VARESA0202-2C682; Reston, Virginia 20191.
Sprint will provide a Notice of 
    Dispute to you in accordance with the "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section of this Agreement.
Sprint will 
    assign a representative to work with you and try to resolve your Dispute to your satisfaction.
You and Sprint agree to make attempts 
    to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action.
If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five 
    (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or Sprint may commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action.
Arbitration Terms, Process, Rules and Procedures


	(1) Unless you and Sprint agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in 
    the county of the last billing address of the Service.
The arbitration will be governed by either: (a) rules that we mutually agree 
    upon; or (b) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the "JAMS Rules"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, 
    including the rules about the filing, administration, discovery and arbitrator fees.
==========
The JAMS rules are available on its website at 
    jamsadr.com.
Notwithstanding any JAMS Rule to the contrary or any other provision in arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern 
    the arbitration, we each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide, except that only a 
    court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.
(2) The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision.
We each agree that the FAA's 
    provisions-not state law-govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration.
To the extent that this agreement to 
    arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural 
    Fairness (the "Minimum Standards"), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.
However, nothing in this paragraph will require 
    or allow you or Sprint to arbitrate on a class-wide, representative or consolidated basis.
==========
(3) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the 
    extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
YOU AND SPRINT AGREE THAT EACH 
    MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE 
    PROCEEDING.Further, unless both you and Sprint expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one 
    person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If any portion of this provision 
    is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
==========
(4) We each are responsible for our respective costs, including our respective counsel, experts, and witnesses.
Sprint will pay for 
    any filing or case management fees associated with the arbitration and the professional fees for the arbitrator's services.
==========
(5) An arbitrator's award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written 
    statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award.
The arbitrator's decision and award is final 
    and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
==========
(6) As an alternative to arbitration, we may resolve Disputes in small claims court in the county of your most recent billing address.
In addition, this arbitration agreement does not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or 
    local government agency.
==========
Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Sprint on your behalf.
No Trial By Jury and No Class Action


	IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, 
    REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS AN ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDING, WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY 
    LAW, THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL OR CLASS ACTION AND WE EACH UNCONDITIONALLY (1) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (2) WAIVE ANY 
    RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS, INCLUDING JOINING A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A 
    CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACTITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING.
==========
Indemnification


	You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Sprint and our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, vendors, suppliers, and licensors 
    harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions, including, but not limited to, your use of the Service and any 
    information you submit, post, transmit, or make available via the Service; failing to provide appropriate notices regarding 
    location-enabled services (see "Location-Enabled Services" section); failure to safeguard your passwords, backup question to your 
    shared secret question, or other account information; or violating this Agreement or any policy referenced in this Agreement, any 
    applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party.
Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement


	Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, you must provide us notice by calling or writing us as instructed on your 
    invoice.
==========
We will provide you notice through one or more of the following: in your bill, correspondence to your last known billing 
    address, to any fax number or e-mail address you've provided us, by calling you on your Device or any other phone number you've 
    provided us, by voice message on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, or by text message on your Device.
Contacting You Regarding Billing and Collections


	You expressly authorize, and specifically consent to allowing Sprint and any of Sprint's agents to contact you in connection with any 
    and all matters relating to unpaid past due charges you owe Sprint.
You agree that, for attempts to collect unpaid past due charges, 
    Sprint and any of its agents may contact you at any mailing address, telephone number, cellular phone number, email address, or any 
    other electronic address that you have provided, or may in the future provide, to Sprint.
You agree and acknowledge that any e-mail 
    address or any other electronic address that you provide to Sprint is your private address and is not accessible to unauthorized third 
    parties.
For attempts to collect unpaid charges, you agree that in addition to individual persons attempting to communicate directly 
    with you, any type of contact described above may be made using, among other methods, pre-recorded or artificial voice messages 
    delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, pre-set e-mail messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system, or any other 
    pre-set electronic messages delivered by any other automatic electronic messaging system.
Other Important Terms


	Subject to federal law or unless the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, this Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the 
    state encompassing the billing address of the Device, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of that state.
==========
If either of us 
    waives or doesn't enforce a requirement under this Agreement in an instance, we don't waive our right to later enforce that 
    requirement.
Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, if any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, 
    the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect.
==========
This Agreement isn't for the benefit of any third party except our 
    corporate parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in interest.
You can't assign the Agreement or 
    any of your rights or duties under it, unless we agree to the assignment.
We can assign the Agreement without notice.
You cannot in 
    any manner resell the Services to another party.
==========
The Agreement and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement between 
    us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreements—you can't rely on any contradictory documents or statements by sales or 
    service representatives.
The rights, obligations and commitments in the Agreement that—by their nature—would logically 
    continue beyond the termination of Services (for example, those relating to billing, payment, 911, dispute resolution, no class 
    action, no jury trial) survive termination of Services.
