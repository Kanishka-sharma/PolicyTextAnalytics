Adverty AB (“Adverty,” “we” or “us”) understands the importance of privacy.
Adverty operates a desktop, console and mobile Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality ad network (the “Ad Network” or the “Services”) through which Adverty displays targeted, contextual ads.
Our clients are “Advertisers” that wish to distribute ad content through the Adverty Ad Network, and “Publishers” that want to display ads to “end users” of their games and applications (“application” or “app”).
In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain from end users in connection with the Adverty Ad Network
What Information Do We Collect and Why?
We do not collect name, email address or contact information from end users.

However, in order to operate the Adverty Ad Network and to display ads to end users we may automatically collect certain information from end users within a single application, including:

• IP Address, Android ID, MAC Address, IFA, UDID, and other unique identifiers;
• Activities and page views within a single application;
• Language information, device make and model, device connection, height and width and field of view of device, device volume, time zone and city, state-level location information, and operating system type, name, and version;
• Information about the mobiles apps that a user currently has installed on their device; and Information about the ads an end-user has already been displayed, so that we can optimize the ads we display later

We may use various tracking technologies to collect this information, such as pixel tags and pixel impression trackers from third party services and tracking technologies.
We may also receive a list of unique identifiers from Publishers and Advertisers, which we may use to determine to what end users to display (or not display) certain ads
Separately, we may also collect email, contact, payment and related information from publishers and advertisers
