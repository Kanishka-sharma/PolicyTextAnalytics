Privacy Policy
Effective as of March 16, 2016.
Our privacy policy describes how YouGov collects and processes your personal information.
YouGov values your trust, and to earn your trust we present this policy in clear and plain language.
The practices described in this privacy policy apply to all the products and services offered on our digital media platforms (e.g., web, mobile).
==========
The YouGov digital media platforms are operated by YouGov, a non-partisan polling and market research firm headquartered in Redwood City, California and one of the YouGov companies.
YouGov is committed to answering important political and social questions and YouGov is designed to give people a chance to share their opinions about those important topics.
About This Privacy Policy
YouGov respects the privacy of all of its visitors and participants.
==========
This privacy policy outlines what personally identifiable information is collected, how the information is used, with whom the information may be shared, and the security procedures in place to help prevent loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.
If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here.
==========
When a user registers for the panel, we ask a few basic questions to verify demographic information (e.g., age, gender, state of residence).
We may also collect personally identifiable information (described below) where membership registration is required.
We do not sell or disclose this personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties, except under certain conditions such as those specifically noted below.
==========
Digital Tracking
YouGov takes all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our digital media platform visitors, but we cannot promise that the current limitations of our applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference.
As our applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future.
Please return to this privacy policy for further updates on this topic.
Further, our digital media service providers and business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across digital media platforms.
We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on other digital media services that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those websites.
==========
Non-Personal Information We Collect
Without registration for a YouGov panel, the only information we may collect is non-personal information through the use of Cookies, web beacons or similar analytics-driven technologies.
As is true of most digital services, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
Usage and Referral Information
We also collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services.
This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on.
==========
Additionally, like most digital services today, we keep digital log files that record data each time a device accesses our servers.
The log files contain data about the nature of each access.
We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
If you arrive at a YouGov service from an external source (such as a link on another website or contained in an email), we may use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
==========
Cookies
The information collected by Cookies allows us to monitor how many people are using our services and their interactions with other services, how many people open our e-mails, and determine for what purposes these actions are being taken.
Cookies are also used to facilitate a user's log-in, as navigation aids, and as session timers, and to restrict underage use of YouGov tools and services.
We also use Cookies to match non-personally identifiable information to third-party databases to create anonymized marketing profiles that could result in you seeing customized advertising or content when browsing the internet.
==========
Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
We do not link non-personal information from Cookies to personally identifiable information without permission, and we do not use Cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information.
To learn more about Cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org, or consult either the DAA's third party Cookie opt-out mechanism at www.aboutads.info/choices, or that of the NAI at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
==========
Web Beacons
We also may use Web Beacons to collect non-personal information about the use of our services.
The information collected by web beacons allows us to monitor how many people are using our services, how many people open our e-mails, and determine for what purposes these actions are being taken.
Our web beacons are not used to track activity outside of our services.
==========
We do not link non-personal information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without permission and do not use web beacons to collect or store personally identifiable Information.
Personally Identifiable Information We Collect
Registration
To register with YouGov as a panelist, we require visitors to submit personally identifiable information.
This information may include items such as name, mailing address, mobile device number, and e-mail address that our members provide to us when they register as YouGov panelists.
The personally identifiable information our users provide is kept confidential, but will be shared in connection with our services and our trusted service providers.
Visitors are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personally identifiable information they submit to YouGov.
We use the personally identifiable information to gather opinions on important topics, answer questions, send communications about service maintenance and updates, place panelists in the correct regional and political jurisdictions (e.g. the correct congressional district or voting precinct), and inform panelists of material changes to this privacy policy.
==========
E-mails You Send to YouGov
This privacy policy does not protect you when you send content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions to YouGov by e-mail.
If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an e-mail.
Children
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.
==========
YouGov is a general audience service.
YouGov does not direct its content toward children who are under 13 years old, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
If YouGov or its Internet Service Providers become aware that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information without parental consent, YouGov will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
Surveys – Personally Identifiable Information
When participating in a survey, we may ask panelists to submit personally identifiable information.
This personally identifiable information is used for research purposes, and is not used for our direct sales solicitations.
When surveys are conducted on behalf of our clients, individual level responses are stripped of all personally identifying information before being provided to the client; however, we may provide such personally identifiable information to a third-party, such as a distributor, or validator, when it is necessary to redeem a prize or reward.
When a survey is sponsored by a third party, aggregate information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor.
==========
Personally identifiable information collected through surveys will be used only by YouGov, its business partners and its operations contractors, and will not be given or sold to a third party without the panelist’s consent.
You will never receive email from any unrelated third party as a result of using the YouGov site, unless our service offerings require us or a third party to send you information.
Surveys – Responses
Aside from personally identifiable information, YouGov may, in the course of interacting with panel members, gather other types of information ("Operating Information").
YouGov panelists receive survey invitations periodically (weekly or monthly, for example) depending on their stated preferences.
These surveys will ask questions about opinions and attitudes toward current affairs.
Additional information to inform research
YouGov may also use cookies, matching to external databases, software metering devices and similar technologies to supplement our survey data with information about your exposure to advertising and media consumption.
==========
Disclosure of Information
Except as set forth in this privacy policy or as specifically agreed to by you, YouGov will not disclose to unrelated third parties any personally identifiable information collected via our services.
We will only release personally identifiable or personal information to third parties: (1) to fulfill the transactions that result from your interactions with our services; (2) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; (3) to reduce fraud or criminal activity; (4) to protect the legal rights of YouGov, our customers, our services, or the users of our services; (5) to allow a purchaser of a YouGov division, YouGov assets, or YouGov as a whole, to continue using your personally identifiable information to serve you or as otherwise permitted by this privacy policy; or (6) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others.
In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose personally identifiable or personal information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would, interfere with a law enforcement investigation, violate the law or court order.
In addition, we may disclose personal information as described below.
Aggregate Data
YouGov may provide aggregate information to third parties.
For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our services and the activities they conduct while on our site.
We might also inform an interested policy group that "30% of our users live east of the Mississippi" or that "25% of our users have registered to vote online."
==========
Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregate information.
We require parties, with whom we share aggregate information to agree that they will not attempt to re-identify, re-associate, de-aggregate or make this information personally identifiable, for example, by combining it with other databases.
Disclosure to YouGov Operations and Maintenance Contractors
YouGov operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to personally identifiable information in the course of providing products or services to YouGov.
These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, or external data or other content.
Access to personally identifiable information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to provide its services to YouGov.
We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors: 1) protect the privacy of personally identifiable information consistent with this privacy policy; and 2) not use or disclose personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services.
Disclosure to Third Parties
YouGov may share personally identifiable information with trusted third parties that will use your personal information for specialized research and statistical analysis.
Data Security and Responsibility
Your personally identifiable information, demographic information, and Operating Information will generally be stored in our YouGov databases, which are located in the United States.
==========
YouGov uses intrusion prevention technologies to protect information held in our servers, and requires all employees to abide by our privacy policy and be subject to disciplinary action if they violate it.
YouGov also backs up our systems to protect the integrity of the personally identifiable and personal information we collect.
Despite our efforts to protect the personally identifiable information and personal information of our panelists, digital services are always subject to inherent risks that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security controls or that transmissions of information over the Internet will be intercepted.
==========
YouGov cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information, other information that you submit or upload to any digital service, personal searches, and other communications will always be impenetrable from attacks by cyber criminals.
You should take care with regard to how you handle and disclose your personally identifiable information or any username or password that you are required to use to access YouGov services.
We may offer services that include features that enable you to share certain types of personally identifiable information, for example, your user identification; with a third party.
That information may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application.
Using this type of functionality typically requires you to login to your account via our site or on the third-party service.
==========
YouGov does not control any of these third party web services or any of their content.
You expressly acknowledge and agree that YouGov is in no way responsible or liable for any such third party services or features.
California Privacy Rights
YouGov will not share any personally identifiable information about you with outside third parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent prohibited by California law, unless you agree otherwise as authorized by your prior written consent.

The categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, if any;
The names and addresses of the third parties who received information for their direct marketing purposes; and
Examples of the products and services subject to the third-party’s direct marketing programs, if the nature of the third party’s business cannot be determined from their names.
==========

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information only in aggregate to analyse trends, and to administer and track usage of the site.
YouGov also uses cookies, web beacons and other digital tracking technologies.
Cookies are small files downloaded on to your computer when you visit a website.
==========
Web beacons are transparent images that can track when a computer visits a particular website.
web beacons and other digital tracking technologies allow us to do lots of things to deliver and improve our services: they allow us to see how many people are using our websites and opening our emails and to determine for what purposes these actions are being taken, and to understand how they interact with other websites.
They also allow us to facilitate a user's log-in and monitor web usage to inform research on internet habits (in general, not on an individual level) and are used as navigation aids and as session timers.
==========
YouGov also works with advertisers to recruit people to the YouGov panel, each of whom provide information on how to opt out of cookies.
Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies and web beacons in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
If you do disable them, you may not be able to access certain features of our website or use some of our services.
We use the information we collect from you for market research purposes and the administration of your YouGov account.
Your individual responses to questions will be used only for statistical analyses, without your name or other personally identifying information being disclosed.
