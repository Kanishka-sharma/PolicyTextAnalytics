Bottom line: We know that almost no one reads those 10 page TOS guidelines, so we'll make this short and sweet...
You're free to put up anything with a genuine purpose.
Generally something that your grandmother would accept or like.
==========
Other than that, you are PROHIBITED from putting any content that's related to the following: (If found, our staff and automated scripts will FIND AND REMOVE THEM INSTANTLY and your I.P. banned from 110mb network.)
To be banned by 110MB & have your account deleted, do this: 



Phishing of any company, especially MySpace, eBay, PayPal and other banks.
(This is when a scammer creates a fake company site that looks real, hence tricking the visitor to enter their username/password.)
==========
Hosting Proxy  Scripts (like PHProxy).
These are scripts that allow a visitor to enter any domain through your site, and the domain won't pickup the visitors true I.P. address.
Proxy scripts are way to CPU resource intensive.
Hosting Torrent Scripts (like TorrentFlux, SendSpace, RapidLeech).
This is when torrents are downloaded to 110mb servers and you later on download it to your PC.
==========
Using your account mainly for file storage of images, videos or music.
110mb is a working website hosting service (meaning a site with purposeful content on it).
It's not a place to primarily backup/store your files, whether for good or bad intentions.
==========
For picture/file storage see this directory.
Hosting Radio Blogs.
Not allowed for same reason as above point.
These imply you'll be hosting tons of music files.
==========
Using phpMyAdmin.
phpMyAdmin (manages MySQL databases) is extremely CPU resource intensive.
==========
Use  110DBmanager script instead.
Hosting  your own PHP file manager.
Using your own file manager (to upload, delete, etc..
.
files) puts a security risk on the network.
==========
Hence not allowed.
Having more then 3 accounts.
If you registered more then 3 accounts, all of them will be found and deleted.
Eg: acc1/acc2/acc3/acc4.110mb.com.
That's a no-no!
==========
Generally no serious member needs more then 1.
Sales or promotion of beer, hard alcohol, tobacco or drugs.
This especially includes pharmaceutical medicines and stimulators like Viagra and Cialis.
==========
Using your domain to spam other sites.
Do you like getting spam?
Nope.
Does the next person you're targeting?
Nope.
Then don't do it!
==========
110MB contacts any spammers ISP (no!
proxy services can't hide you) to shut down their internet connection and get the spammers personal information.
Stealing someones content or storing or  illegal files.
==========
Includes software/cracks/scripts.
These infringe the rights of it's copyright holders, hence not allowed.
==========
Child porn.
(This is UNrelated to adult porn material, which is ALLOWED.)
This is porn under 18.
It's a no-no bigtime!
==========
Having incorrect/garbage name or address filed on your account.
Eg: A name like "Aaadfdf Ffdfsf" or address like "44444444 Ptrc Rd".
==========
This tells us that you have not read our TOS and don't respect the service.
Consequently account will be deleted.
==========
Not having a homepage at anytime  (hence site displaying "Forbidden" message), or still having original "account created" homepage from 15+ days of your signup date.
Also includes not having a proper website while having uploaded tons of files to your account (hence using host mainly as a file host and not a content website host as it should be).
==========
QUESTION: Are porn sites allowed?
ANSWER: Yes they are totally allowed.
But with exception of child porn (naked humans under 18).
Furthermore, rudeness to staff members for support will NOT be tolerated under any conditions.
==========
In occurrence, you'll be ignored.
In repetitive occurrences, your IP will be banned from 110mb network and account deleted.
