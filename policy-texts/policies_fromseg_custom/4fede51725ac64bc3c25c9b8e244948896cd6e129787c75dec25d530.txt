FANDANGO PRIVACY POLICY
Last Revised: July 13, 2004
Fandango, Inc. ("Fandango") is concerned about your privacy and wants you to 
								be familiar with how it collects, uses and shares your information.
Fandango 
								collects this information when you access the Fandango Web site (the "Site"), 
								when you make a purchase, and when you sign up for or use the various services 
								(the "Services") offered on the Site, such as the Fandango newsletter, Evite 
								Friends or Fandango Bucks.
Some of this information is collected automatically 
								and some is collected only when you provide it voluntarily.
WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES FANDANGO COLLECT FROM ME?
Personally Identifiable Information.
Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you as an 
								individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, 
								login ID, member name and password ("Personally Identifiable Information").
==========
When you sign up for or use a Service or make a purchase, Fandango collects 
								Personally Identifiable Information from you.
Fandango also collects Personally 
								Identifiable Information that you may voluntarily provide when you use the Site 
								or Services, that you may disclose in a public area of the Site (such as a 
								message board or chat room) or that you may include if you communicate with 
								Fandango.
In addition, when you use Site Services such as Fandango Bucks, 
								Fandango will collect the email addresses of others that you provide.
==========
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Fandango collects information from you automatically when you use the Site or 
								Services.
However, the information that Fandango collects automatically does 
								not contain Personally Identifiable Information.
The automatically collected 
								information is information such as your browser type, the URL of the previous 
								Web site you visited, the Web pages and advertisements you view or select, the 
								type of Services you use and the searches you conduct.
==========
This information also 
								includes your movie preferences, such as the movies for which you buy tickets 
								and the theatres where you see those movies.
Fandango also collects information 
								that does not include Personally Identifiable Information when you voluntarily 
								provide it (such as in response to a questionnaire or survey) or post it to a 
								public area of the Site (such as a message board or chat room).
HOW DOES FANDANGO AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT INFORMATION?
==========

								stored on your computer's hard drive.
Fandango's cookies contain Personally 
								Identifiable Information, such as your Login ID and your email address.
Fandango uses cookies to allow you to log in automatically and to ensure that 
								you have agreed to the terms, conditions and policies that govern your use of 
								the Site and Services.

								by allowing Fandango to provide targeted advertising and determine which areas 
								of the Site and which Services are the most popular.
IP Address.
==========
An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when 
								you use the Internet.
Fandango logs your IP address when you use the Site or a 
								Service.

								Services.
==========
Pixels.
Pixels, also called clear GIFs, are invisible files on Web pages that you 
								visit.
When you visit a page on the Site that contains a Pixel, the Pixel 
								communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, whether you 
								have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement.
==========
Fandango 
								uses Pixels to serve advertising, enhance email advertising, and track usage of 
								the Site and Services.
HOW DOES FANDANGO USE THE INFORMATION?

								changes to the Site or Services, to let you know about movies, products or

								or other promotions.

You can choose not to receive certain communications from 
								Fandango as described in the section below entitled "Receiving Communications 
								And Opting Out."
Fandango also uses your Personally Identifiable Information to 
								process and fulfill your purchases, provide you with information that you 
								request, and deliver content to you that is relevant to your interests.
When 
								you use Fandango Bucks to give a gift certificate, Fandango will use the email 
								addresses you provide to send your invites and gift certificates.
Fandango may 
								also use such email addresses to send a one-time promotional email, but will 
								not send further email without the permission of the recipient.
==========
Aggregate Information.
Fandango combines your usage information for the Site and Service with that of 
								other users to determine which areas of the Site and which Services are most 
								popular.

								Personally Identifiable Information.

								Information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation or legal 
								process requires it, or if Fandango determines that it needs to share such 
								information to protect or enforce Fandango's rights or the rights of another 
								user.

WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT PRIVACY?
Security.
We maintain security measures in place in order to attempt to protect against 
								the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personally Identifiable Information 
								under our control.
==========
Please be advised, however, that the Internet and other 
								various networking communication media are not entirely secure, and your 
								information may therefore be subject to interception or loss which is beyond

								disclosure of your information (personally identifiable or otherwise) due to 
								errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond 
								Fandango's reasonable control.

								click on an advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the Web site that 
								you link to will govern the use of your information by that Web site's 
								operator.
Fandango assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of 
								such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise.
Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy 
								policies of any third-party Web sites you link to.
==========
Disclosure Of Information In Public Areas.
If you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information in a public 
								area of the Site or a Service, such as a chat room or message board, that 
								information may be collected and used by a third party to send you unsolicited 
								messages, advertisements or for other purposes.
Fandango does not control the 
								actions of users in public areas of the Site or Services.
If you disclose 
								Personally Identifiable Information in a public area, you do so at your own 
								risk.

								require that a user be 13 years of age or older to submit personally 
								identifiable information.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable 
								information from children under the age of thirteen.
We screen users who wish 
								to provide personal information to prevent users under the age of thirteen from 
								providing such information.
==========
If we become aware that we have inadvertently 
								received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 
								thirteen, we will delete such information from our records.
If we change our 
								practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent 
								before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under 
								the age of thirteen.

								identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do 
								not knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
We do not knowingly 
								allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise 
								distribute personally identifiable contact information.
