Hot linking
Hot linking is defined as inserting a link in a piece of HTML to an image 
        on another server, due to a recent rash of people using our copyrighted 
        images on their own web pages / articles / commercial sites / ebay auctions 
        etc.
==========
We have had to put a technical block on the serving of images, images 
        can now only be seen where they were intended, on pages within this site.
Hot linking takes server time, control, copyright and bandwidth away 
        from the real users of this site and we will not allow it.
If you would 
        like to use an image from dpreview.com please contact us first and ask 
        permission.
