==========
At times, we may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.
When we collect IP addresses, geographic location, browser information, device information, information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services, we may also use such information in two ways.
First, we may use such information in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.
==========
For example, this aggregate information tells us how often users use parts of a Website, so that we can make such Website appealing to as many users as possible.
We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Websites, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience.
In addition, we may also provide Customers with the information listed above so that they may (i) assess, improve, and develop the Media that they make available through the Websites and Services, and (ii) use their Media to maintain and grow their organizations.
Such information may include how many and which Media of a particular Customer was watched by a particular user, from where particular Media was watched, listened to, or accessed by a particular user and how many times particular Media was watched, listened to, or accessed by a particular user.
==========
IV.
Will Wistia Share Any of the Personal Information it Collects?
We share your Personal Information with third parties as described below.
==========
A. Customers:

==========
B. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through a website (either alone or jointly with us).
You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.
We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to enter into such transaction or to receive such service, please review the applicable third party websites’ policies.
C. Agents and Service Providers:
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your Personal Information with them to provide products or services to you, for example, processing credit card payments.

We acknowledge our potential liability if our agents misuse your Personal Information.
==========
D. User Profiles and Submissions:
Certain user profile information, including, without limitation, a user’s name, location, and any video, audio recordings, images or other content that such user has uploaded to a Website, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within such Website or to address your request for Wistia’s services.
Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.

Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload video, audio recordings, images, or other content through the Website and other users can contact you through messages and comments.
E. Transfers of Personal Information Subject to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
We will provide EU or Swiss individuals with opt-out or opt-in choice before we share their data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.

VIII.
==========
What Are Wistia’s Service Differences?
Wistia does not offer any financial incentives for providing your Personal Information.
However, there are some service differences when users create an account and provide the necessary Personal Information to do so.
Although much Media and parts of the Services may be used and accessed without providing your Personal Information, other Media, portions of Media, and parts of the Services require users to create and log in to a Wistia account.
In doing so, you will provide us with a user name or e-mail address and a password.
In return we will permit access to Media and Services that are not viewable or accessible to anonymous users.
By creating and logging into an account, you will provide your name and contact information, in addition to your username or email and password combination.
==========
Per the terms of this Privacy Policy, you will also permit Wistia to automatically collect, use, and share IP addresses, browser information, device information, and information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services.
Wistia will also collect, use, and share any information you voluntarily provide in your communications to us, your user profile, and other user-generated submissions and content, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Consistent with the CCPA, this service difference represents Wistia’s good-faith calculation of how one individual’s Personal Information increases the value of the data we provide to Customers, on average.
We calculate this value in conjunction with Customers by comparing the utility of the data collected anonymously against the utility of the Personal Information collected from identified users.
==========
Once you have opted in to this incentive program by creating an account, you may opt-out of this incentive program at any time by deleting your account and/or contacting us at:
Attention: Data Protection Office
Wistia, Inc.
17 Tudor Street
Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139 USA
privacy@wistia.com

However, other requests to exercise your data privacy rights that do not affect Wistia’s ability to provide data to our Customers will not affect such access.
IX.
