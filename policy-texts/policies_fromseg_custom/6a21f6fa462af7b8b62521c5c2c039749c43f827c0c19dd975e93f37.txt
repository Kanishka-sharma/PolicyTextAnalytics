Cookies are computer files that are saved to your computer or device and which may store information about you, your computer or device, and browser.

We may use this information for any lawful purpose, including, for example, using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to operate the UC Service, to help identify you, and to gather usage information.
You may choose to decline cookies or other tracking mechanisms if your browser or system permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the UC Service.
