If by reason of death or Disability (as defined below) you are unable to receive all services for which you have contracted, you and your estate may elect to be relieved of the obligation to make payments for the Services other than those received before death or the onset of disability.
==========
If you have prepaid any amount for Services, so much of the amount prepaid that is allocable to Services that you have not received shall be promptly refunded to you and your representative.
"Disability" means a condition which precludes you from physically using the Services specified in the contract during the term of disability and the condition is verified in writing by a physician designated and remunerated by you.
The written verification of the physician shall be presented to Zoosk.
If the physician determines that the duration of the disability will be less than six months, you may extend the term of the contract for a period of six months at no additional charge to the buyer in lieu of cancellation.
==========
You acknowledge that the Services are accessible online and are offered in many locations internationally and that therefore, there is no physical dating service office.
Thus, you acknowledge and agree that for purposes of California Civil Code¬§ 1694.3(b), the term "Dating Service Office" shall mean any location where the Services are available.
If you relocate your primary residence further than 50 miles from Zoosk's Dating Service Office and you are unable to transfer the contract to a comparable facility, you may elect to be relieved of the obligation to make payment for services, other than those received prior to that relocation.
Upon such election, if you have prepaid any amount for dating services, so much of the amount prepaid that is allocable to services that you have not received shall be promptly refunded to you   If you elect to be relieved of further obligation pursuant to this subdivision, Zoosk may charge you a fee of $100.00 or, if more than half the life of the contract has expired, a fee of $50.00, not to exceed the amount of the refund to which you are entitled.
Such fee shall be deducted from any refund which Zoosk is required to make to you.
==========

The following additional provision(s) apply if you are an Illinois subscriber (as determined by the zip code you use at the time of your subscription):

==========
If you relocate your primary residence to a location that is more than 25 miles from where our Services are comparably offered, you may cancel this contract and shall be liable only for that portion of the charges allocable to the time before reasonable evidence of the relocation is presented to Zoosk plus a fee equal to the lesser of (1) 10% of the unused balance or (2) $50.
Such fee shall be deducted from any refund which Zoosk is required to make to you.
If by reason of death you are unable to receive all services for which you have contracted, your estate may elect to be relieved of the obligation to make payments for the Services other than those received before death.
We shall have the right to require and verify reasonable evidence of the death.

You acknowledge and agree that if you post any information, including photographs, to the Services for posting on your profile or other areas of the Services, such information will be publicly accessible, and you are consenting to the display of such information on the Services.
If you permanently relocate your primary residence further than 50 miles from any area in which Zoosk offers the Services, you may elect to terminate your subscription by notifying us in writing at the address stated in this Agreement.
