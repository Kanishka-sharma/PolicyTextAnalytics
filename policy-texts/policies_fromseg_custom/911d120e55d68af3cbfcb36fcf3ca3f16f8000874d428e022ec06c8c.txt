Information Relating to Children
7.1      The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information from children under 13 years of age.
The Six Apart Sites, Products and Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age, but we recognize that, with proper adult supervision, some parents or guardians might permit their children to visit and utilize the Six Apart Sites, Products and Services.
COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the Six Apart Sites, Products and Services.
7.2      When a child attempts to register with and/or provide Personal Information to Six Apart (including on or through any of the Six Apart Sites, Products and Services), we require a parent or legal guardian to:
