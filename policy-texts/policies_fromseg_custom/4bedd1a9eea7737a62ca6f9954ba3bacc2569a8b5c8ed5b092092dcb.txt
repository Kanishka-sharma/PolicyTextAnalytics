What Data Does Adobe AudienceManager Collect?
==========
We collect non-personally identifiable data regarding the online activities of visitors to websites and other online properties operated by members of our service.
Our service is not designed to collect personally identifiable data.
We also do not intentionally collect data that we consider to be sensitive.
We currently consider the following kinds of data to be sensitive: certain health data, certain financial data, data about adult-oriented products or services.
==========
We may combine the data we collect with other non-personally identifiable data.
How Does Adobe AudienceManager Collect Data?
We use online techniques such as "cookies" and "pixel tags" to collect data.
Cookies are small bits of information that identify a browser.
You may be able to set your browser to reject all third-party cookies (including those set by Adobe AudienceManager) or to alert you when a third-party cookie is sent.
For more information, please look at your browser's specific instructions for managing cookies.
==========
Pixel tags are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering an image online.
An entity that serves a pixel tag can set, read, and modify cookies on, and transfer other data to, the browser that receives the online image.
Pixel tags can also obtain information about the computer being used to view that online image.
Examples of the types of data we collect through cookies and pixel tags include the following: IP address of the computer, the time it was sent, the user's operating system and browser type, the visitor's browsing and purchasing behavior such as the date and time the visitor visited the website that set the cookie or delivered the pixel tag, the areas of the website visited, the types of products purchased, the information submitted on order forms and website registrations, and other clickstream data, none of which is personally identifiable.
==========
How Does Adobe AudienceManager Use The Data?
We provide the data we collect to the members of our service.
These members may use the data for various purposes, such as targeting advertisements or other content to website visitors.
Our members have confirmed to us that the collection and use of the data complies with their own privacy policies.
We also may use the data we collect to create industry reports, analyses, and similar materials that we may use for sales, marketing or other business purposes.
Does Adobe AudienceManager Share The Data With Third Parties?
As described above, we share data with the members of our service.
As described below, we may also provide data to third party service providers, to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials, and in connection with the sale or transfer of our assets.
==========
First, we may share data with third party service providers, such as data storage companies, who provide operational or other support services to us.
Those service providers must agree to safeguard the data in compliance with this policy.
==========
Second, we may share data with regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
We may also access or disclose data to protect or defend our legal rights, our property, our employees and agents, the safety and security of our members and their website visitors, and to protect against fraud.
==========
Third, we may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with a merger, acquisition, debt financing, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy or other business transaction.
If that happens, the data may be one of the assets transferred.
==========
How Can I Opt Out?
As described below, you can opt out of being targeted by the data collected from our service by visiting www.DoNotTarget.com, or you can opt out of having data collected by blocking third party cookies on your web browser.
First, if you do not want the members of our service to use non-personally identifiable data for targeting purposes you can visit www.DoNotTarget.com and download the Adobe AudienceManager "Do Not Target" cookie.
DoNotTarget.com is a free service operated by Adobe AudienceManager and is intended to address important privacy and consumer protection issues in online advertising by giving consumers control and transparency into who is using non-personally identifiable data for targeting purposes.
Please note that the "Do Not Target" process is based on cookies and will only work if your browser accepts third party cookies.
==========
Furthermore if the Adobe AudienceManager cookie is deleted from your browser, Adobe AudienceManager will have no way to know that you elected to opt out of targeting (this is true of any company that relies on cookies to monitor opt-out status).
Therefore, if you delete a Adobe AudienceManager cookie you must re-visit www.DoNotTarget.com and again elect to opt out.
==========
Alternatively, if you wish to prevent the collection of non-personally identifiable information altogether you can block all third-party cookies on your browser.
This option may prevent you from enjoying customized experiences on the websites you visit.
Please look at your browser's specific instructions for this option.
==========
Does Adobe AudienceManager Target Kids?
We do not intentionally collect data from children under 13 years of age.
==========
Is The Data Secure?
We take appropriate measures to protect the data in our control from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
While we work very hard to protect the data, no data security measure can guarantee that the data will always remain secure.
==========
How Long Does Adobe AudienceManager Keep The Data?
We retain data for no more than two years unless we have a business need to retain it for a longer time period.
==========
What About Changes To This Policy?
We may update this policy from time to time.
We will post any such changes to this website.
If a policy change may result in a materially more permissive use of data collected before the effective date of the policy change, we will obtain prior affirmative consent from affected users before implementing the change.
