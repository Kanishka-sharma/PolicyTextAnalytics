For all such information and material, you grant TI, its affiliates and related entities, including Chicagotribune.com and its affiliated newspaper, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, copy, modify, display, archive, store, distribute, reproduce and create derivative works from such information, in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now existing or developed in the future.

All rights in this paragraph are granted without the need for additional compensation of any sort to you.
Please note Chicagotribune.com does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas for use or publication, and is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas transmitted to Chicagotribune.com.
Should you send any unsolicited materials or ideas, you do so with the understanding no additional consideration of any sort will be provided to you, and you are waiving any claim against Chicagotribune.com and its affiliates regarding the use of such materials and ideas, even if material or an idea is used that is substantially similar to the idea you sent.
==========
Transactions and e-commerce on our site.
During your visit to our site you may elect to engage in a transaction involving the purchase of a product such as a newspaper subscription, a print or online advertisement or other tangible goods and services.
To serve you most efficiently, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third party processing agent, bank or distribution institution.
==========
While in most cases transactions are completed without difficulty, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet or offline.
If you're concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call us and place your order by phone.
Chicagotribune.com cannot take responsibility for the success or security of transactions undertaken or processed by third parties.
On occasion, a product or service may not be available at the time or the price as it appears in an advertisement.
In such event, or in the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error, technology effort, error in the date or length of publication, or error in pricing or product information received from our advertisers or suppliers, you agree Chicagotribune.com is not responsible for such errors or discrepancies.
==========
Other Specifics About Interactive Areas (Message Boards, Chat Areas, automated posting of classified or other advertising, etc.).
Chicagotribune.com bulletin boards, chat rooms and other such interactive areas are provided to give users an interesting and stimulating forum to express their opinions and share ideas and information.
Given the nature of Chicagotribune.com and the volume of messages and postings, Chicagotribune.com cannot and does not monitor all of the material posted or transmitted by users and third party information providers.
To protect your safety, please use your best judgment when using these forums.
==========
We particularly discourage divulging personal phone numbers and addresses or other information that can be used to identify or locate you.
If you make such disclosures either through postings on the bulletin boards, chat rooms, in classified advertising you place or in other interactive areas, or to third parties in any communication, you do so fully understanding the consequences of such disclosures and with a knowing consent that such information could be used to identify you.
Chicagotribune.com reserves the right to delete, move or edit any communications at any time, for any reason or in its discretion, but has no obligation to review or remove any such content.
Posting Rules.
Interactive areas, discussion boards, chat rooms, etc., are intended to encourage public debate.

But by using these areas of Chicagotribune.com, you are participating in a community that is intended for all our users.
