This now forms part of every page on the www.birmingham.ac.uk site.

The Platform uses only non Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
It operates by associating non-PII with browsers and devices, so that the University and its partner digital agencies can then use the information to select appropriate advertising to be delivered to you on behalf of the University.
