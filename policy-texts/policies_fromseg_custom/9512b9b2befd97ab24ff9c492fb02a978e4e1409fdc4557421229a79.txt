Your media consumption activities (e.g., streaming and downloading music, streaming video, IPTV, digital video, etc.) may be tracked through your use of the Myspace Services, subject to some limited preference settings that are available when you log into your account.
We also collect data via automatic means (described below in “Cookies and other Web Technologies”) when you use the Myspace Services or click on links to third party websites from the websites that are part of the Myspace Services.
Some of this information relates to the devices that you use to use the Myspace Services, such as a computer, mobile phone, tablet, smart TV or other electronic device.
(We use the term "Device" in this Notice to refer to any of these.)
The information we collect automatically may include:  technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your Device to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, hardware (e.g., make and model of phone), mobile network; the areas within the Myspace Services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences, which artists you are listening to, what videos you are viewing, or Profiles or content pages you choose to connect with, etc.; your Device location (including using GPS and longitude and latitude location information) and certain other Device usage data such as the time of day; information about your visit to the Myspace site and use of the Myspace Services, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our site (in other words, where you came from and where you go on the Web, including date and time); the media or other products or services you viewed, used or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page; ranking information about you with respect to other Users or content pages that you interact with (e.g., Myspace may record the links to content pages that you post and rank your association with that content compared to other Users).
Cookies and other Web Technologies We use a number of technologies that store information on your Device and read and update that information later to help us provide the Myspace Services to you and for purposes of displaying advertisements to you on the Myspace website and other websites (all described further below in “What we do with your data”).
These information storage technologies include cookies, mobile device identifiers, web beacons, embedded scripts, and entity tags.
New technologies that perform similar functions may be developed.
If we adopt new technologies that are not already descripted in our Cookies & Web Technologies Notice, we will update that Notice to let you know.
==========
What we do with your data We use your personal data to administer your Myspace account and to provide the Myspace Services to you.
If you have set up a Myspace account, we may send you e-mails promoting the Myspace Services and related goods and services to you unless you have asked us not to do that.
(However, we will not share your e-mail address for third parties for purposes of direct marketing unless you have given us permission to do that.)
==========
We also use web technologies to collect information to let us understand which Devices all belong to you, so we can offer a seamless cross-Device experience.
For example, we gather information about your use of Myspace on your mobile phone, tablet and laptop and associate all of those Devices for you so it doesn’t matter which device you use to access our services – the information and media that you see will all be up-to-date and you can pick up wherever you left off.
We use your personal data, and some de-identified data derived from your personal data, to deliver targeted advertising on the Myspace websites and in apps that we may provide, and to allow third parties to do the same thing on other websites and apps.
Read on for more information about this!
==========
What do we mean by targeted advertising?
Like many free services on the web (and free mobile apps), Myspace uses revenue from our own and third party advertising to pay for the cost of providing our free services to you.
Online advertisements can be randomly generated without knowing anything about the user who will see the adverts, but these days a lot of online advertising is targeted in some way so users see adverts that are more likely to interest them.
We use your data to deliver targeted advertising to you on the Myspace websites and in apps that we may provide, and to allow third parties to do the same thing on other websites and apps.
These advertisements may be selected for you based on your location and/or usage of the Myspace Services or third party websites or services that you have used.
How we protect your privacy when targeting adverts to you To display adverts that are more likely to interest you, we (and third party advertising services) may cross-reference information that we hold about you with information that others hold about you.
For example, we may use software that checks several customer databases (like Myspace’s user database, a separate video service database and a particular loyalty card database) to see which users appear in all three, and then target adverts just to those users.
Information held in a particular database about a specific person is often referred to as that person’s "profile."
==========
When we or our affiliates use your personal data to deliver targeted advertising to you, we use advert delivery technologies that encrypt information that would otherwise identify you to prevent the third party advertiser from knowing who you are.
The encryption technologies that we use convert data that identifies you (like a registered account name or e-mail address) into a string of characters that cannot be turned back into information that identifies you.
So the third party that displays the advert to you will know that the advert is being displayed to someone with certain characteristics (e.g., a woman in her early twenties who likes to listen to Rihanna and go to music festivals in the UK) but the third party won’t have your name, e-mail address or any other information that would allow them to identify you specifically.
We add information about the adverts that have been shown to you and information about devices, purchasing or online behavior associated with a particular encryption-generated identifier to create a profile for that identifier.
This profile helps us to better match adverts to your interests and avoid showing you the same adverts too many times.
==========
If you have a Myspace account, we store that profile until you delete your Myspace account or change your personalized advertising settings to turn off personalized advertising.
If you have set up a Myspace account, we may send you e-mails promoting the Myspace Services to you unless you have asked us not to do that (which you can do here).
However, we will not share your e-mail address for third parties for purposes of direct marketing unless you have given us permission to do that.
==========
How to opt-out of targeted advertising If you do not want us to use your data to provide targeted advertisements to you, or allow others to do that, you can let us know here.
For additional information on options for opting out of advertising by third parties, please visit www.youronlinechoices.com.
It’s important to understand that if you opt out of targeted advertising, you will still see adverts when you use the Myspace Services – the adverts may just be less relevant to you.
How we may share your data We may share your data within our corporate group, and particularly with our affiliates Viant Technology LLC, Viant US LLC, Viant UK Limited and Xumo LLC for uses consistent with this EEA Privacy Notice, including for targeted advertising.
We may share your data with our contractors and business partners for the purposes described in this EEA Privacy Notice, including for targeted advertising.
==========
Myspace may disclose your data in the event we file for bankruptcy, or in connection with certain types of business transactions that result in a change in who owns our company or our assets.
We may disclose your data to enforce or protect our legal rights, or in response to a court order or other request that we are required by law to comply with.
More details about how we share your data are available here.
==========
How we secure your data Myspace uses various security measures that are typical of social media services, including server firewalls and SSL encryption for data that is in transit, to protect the integrity and security of your data once we receive it from you.
We periodically evaluate available security technologies and change our security measures as we think appropriate in light of the risks to your data.
Please click here for more information about security.
==========
How long we keep your data Myspace account holders:  We may use and disclose your media content consumption information for up to two years from the date in which you consent unless you otherwise withdraw your consent.
If we obtain a new consent from you after the date that we obtain your original consent, this period will be extended for additional two year periods each time we obtain a new consent from you.
Please review the terms of our Video Privacy Policy, which supplements this Notice.
If your account is inactive for over two years, we may still store your media content consumption information for a reasonable period of time so that it will be available again if you reactivate your account.
==========
However, we are not obliged to store that information.
You can always ask us to delete your data by clicking here.
Your data will be transferred to the US and possibly other countries Myspace is based in the USA, and the data that we collect from you is transferred to, and stored and used in, the USA.
We may also transfer your data to other countries outside the EEA for processing by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our contractors.
For example, our customer support may be provided by contractors located in the Philippines.
Please be aware that the laws of the USA and other countries outside of the EEA may not protection your data to the same level as the laws of the EEA, or give you the same rights that you would have in the EEA (including right relating to access to personal data by law enforcement or national security/intelligence agencies).
By accepting this Notice, you are giving your consent to the transfer of your personal data to the USA and other countries outside of the EEA and the further storage and use of your personal data in the USA and those other countries.
==========
Key Terms  Terminology.
A quick word about terminology: European Union data protection law covers the “processing” of personal data in a range of situations.
“Processing” is defined by the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) to mean “any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction.”
To make this Notice more reader-friendly, we refer to processing by simpler terms such as use, transfer and storage – but this Notice covers all kinds of processing that’s subject to EU data protection law.
Also, when we refer to “data” in this Notice, we mean your “personal data” as defined in the Directive (“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity”).
The Directive is due to be replaced by the EU’s General Data Protection Directive (“GDPR”) on May 25, 2018, and when that happens, the terms used in this Notice should be interpreted to correspond to the GDPR.
