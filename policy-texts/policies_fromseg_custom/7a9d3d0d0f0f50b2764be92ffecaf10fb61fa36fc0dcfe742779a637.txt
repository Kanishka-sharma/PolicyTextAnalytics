Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer.
The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalized Newsletter/ Horoscope information).

The cookies further help to deliver a better service that is keyed to the interests of our visitors.
We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often and we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit.
If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple process to manually delete your cookies.
