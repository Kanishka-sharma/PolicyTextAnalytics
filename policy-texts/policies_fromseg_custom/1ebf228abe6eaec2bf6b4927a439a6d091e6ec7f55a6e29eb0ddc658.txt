WebTrends' Privacy Policy

Your Privacy 
WebTrends, a business unit of NetIQ Corporation, is committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers and visitors to our web site.
In particular, we want you to know that we are not in the business of selling or renting individuals' personal data to other companies for marketing purposes.
In this Privacy Policy we provide detailed information on when and why we collect personal information, how we use it, the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others, and how we keep it secure.
Collection and Use of Personal Information 
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address.
==========
In general, you can browse our web site without giving us any personal information.
We use our own product, WebTrends On Demand, to analyze traffic to this web site in order to understand our customer's and visitor's needs and to continually improve our site for them.
WebTrends Reporting Services collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics.
For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address.
For more information, see Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends Reporting Service.
==========
If you want to subscribe to one of our newsletters, we ask you to simply provide your business email address.
In that case, we use your email address only in connection with providing you the newsletter and for no other purpose.
Additional activities on our site require you to be registered – for example, to read a white paper, download a trial or register for an event.
As part of the registration process, we ask you to create a myNetIQ account where we collect additional personal information.
We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products, seminars and services if you so request; to fulfill your request; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records; or to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys.
Some activities require additional personal information besides your myNetIQ account.
==========
For example, to fulfill online orders for products, support, and training, we require you to enter credit card information, and you have the option to provide a separate shipping address.
Disclosure of Personal Information 
In some instances we rely on our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about WebTrends and its solutions.
To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
We sometimes hires vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations.
==========
In addition, we may use third party information or technology in our products and disclose customer information to such third parties solely for the purposes of fulfillment, support, or audit by such third parties.
We may also license/transfer or sell-off our technology to third parties, and in connection with such transitions, we may disclose customer data to the transferee.
Because we have a global presence, your personal information may be shared with other offices or subsidiaries within the NetIQ group of companies in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere.
The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less extensive than laws in the country in which you are located.
However, all companies within the NetIQ group of companies are governed by this Privacy Policy and will use your personal information only as set forth in this policy.
