Educators may provide content from the Services to children under 13 without permitting such children to provide any personal information to the Services, and/or you may allow students under 13 to use our Services only to the extent that you represent that you have the authority to permit the Services to collect personal information from such children for educational purposes, as permitted by COPPA.
If you are an Educator, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and that you are entering into these TOS on behalf of your school and/or district.
==========
For the purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you shall not permit children under 13 to provide personal information to the Services unless you have the requisite authority under COPPA to consent to the Services collecting such personal information from children and that you shall be responsible for managing your account and providing any instructions necessary to ensure the personal information of children under 13 is maintained and used in compliance with COPPA and the scope of your authority to provide parental consent.

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
Governing Law.
These TOS shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Washington, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
==========
You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in King County, Washington State for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.
You agree that King County, Washington State is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
Arbitration.
==========
Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Screencast-O-Matic.
For any dispute with Screencast-O-Matic, you agree to first contact us at legal@screencast-o-matic.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Screencast-O-Matic has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these TOS, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.
JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.
The arbitration will be conducted in King County, Washington State, unless you and Screencast-O-Matic agree otherwise.
==========
If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Screencast-O-Matic from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property or other proprietary rights.
==========
Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.
With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for personal, commercial or other purposes, we each agree that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.
==========
Entire Agreement
These TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and Screencast-O-Matic with respect to the subject matter of these TOS, and supersedes and replaces any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these TOS.
Other than as set forth in the “Indemnification by You” section above, these TOS creates no third party beneficiary rights.
Waiver, Severability & Assignment
Screencast-O-Matic’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these TOS will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
==========
You may not assign this TOS or any of your rights or obligations under these TOS, and any such attempt will be void.
Screencast-O-Matic may assign these TOS or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without restriction.

Referral Program Terms and Conditions
These Referral Program Terms and Conditions (these “Referral Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which you may participate in our referral program (described below).
These Referral Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into this Terms of Service.
Any capitalized terms used but not defined below have the meanings in these TOS.
==========
Referral Program Description
From time to time, Screencast-O-Matic may offer a referral program (“Referral Program”) to its users (“Referring Users”) permitting such Referring User to earn a Pro Recorder new or renewal subscription discount by inviting or referring another person who is not a then-current or past user of Screencast-O-Matic (a “Referred User”), to sign up for an annual Pro Recorder subscription to Screencast-O-Matic using the Referring User’s Referral Link (as defined below).
Referred Users are eligible for a one-time 20% discount on their first annual Pro Recorder subscription fee when they use a Referring User’s Referral Link to sign up for an account, as further described in these Referral Terms.
==========
Acceptance of these Referral Terms; Revised Referral Terms
By participating in the Referral Program in any way, you agree to be bound by these Referral Terms.
If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of these Referral Terms, you may not participate in the Referral Program.
==========
We reserve the right to change any of the terms and conditions contained in these Referral Terms at any time and in our sole discretion by posting the revised Referral Terms via the Screencast-O-Matic services, and updating the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page.
If you do not agree to these Referral Terms or any revised version of these Referral Terms, your sole recourse is to terminate your participation in the Referral Program.
Except as otherwise expressly stated by us, your participation in the Referral Program is subject to, and constitutes your acceptance of, the version of these Referral Terms in effect at the time of your participation in the Referral Program.
While Referral Links (defined below) do not expire, any changes to these Referral Terms will apply to use of a Referral Link by a Referred User even if the Referral Link was sent prior to the revised Referral Terms effectiveness.
==========
Earning Pro Recorder Subscription Discounts
When you register for a Screencast-O-Matic account, or from time to time thereafter, we may provide you with a hyperlink, text link, badge, button, or other code via email, text message or other format containing a URL link unique to your Screencast-O-Matic account (a “Referral Link”), which you may share with your contacts, either by email or social network as prompted by the Screencast-O-Matic services, or by other means outside of the Screencast-O-Matic services.
PLEASE NOTE THAT WHENEVER YOU DECIDE TO SHARE YOUR REFERRAL LINK, YOU MUST TELL YOUR CONTACTS THAT YOU ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE REFERRAL DISCOUNTS.
Failure to disclose this information is a violation of these Referral Terms and Screencast-O-Matic may terminate you immediately from the Referral Program, disqualify you from participating in the Referral Program in the future and cause the forfeiture of any Referral discounts you may have earned.
Subject to these Referral Terms, upon a Referred User completing a Qualifying Sign Up (as defined below), we will send you an email announcing your discount reward and update your awards status on your account page at screencast-o-matic.
com.
==========
It is your responsibility to provide Screencast-O-Matic with a current email address through the Screencast-O-Matic Services to ensure timely email notification of any rewards, though your account page will be updated immediately.
A “Qualifying Sign Up” means the first time a Referred User signs up for the Screencast-O-Matic services and subscribes to an annual paid Pro Recorder subscription.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Referring Users will not be eligible to receive a discount if we determine in our sole discretion that (i) the Referred User has previously signed up for an annual Pro Recorder subscription; (ii) if the Referred User cancels its annual subscription within 1 year of the Qualifying Sign Up.
You can keep earning discounts for each Qualified Sign Up, including earning a free annual Pro Recorder Subscription.
If you earn more than 5 discounts, your additional discounts will be applied to your Pro Recorder Subscription renewal on the anniversary of your Subscription plan.
You can keep earning discounts up to a lifetime subscription to the Pro Recorder.
Referred User Discount
Subject to these Referral Terms, a Referred User will receive a 20% discount (the “Discount”) toward an annual Pro Recorder subscription.
Referred Users will be required to register and to accept these TOS in order to use the Screencast-O-Matic Services and to take advantage of the Discount.
The Discount shall only apply toward a Referred User’s first annual Pro Recorder subscription fee, and without limiting the foregoing, will not apply to (i) subsequent renewal subscription fees; (ii) any subscription plan other than the Pro Recorder annual plan, or (iii) any other fees or charges which may apply to a Referred User’s use of the Screencast-O-Matic Services.
==========
Restrictions and Limitations
We reserve the right to investigate any suspicious or inappropriate activity relating to the Referral Program.
You may not engage in any fraudulent or deceitful behavior in connection with the Referral Program, including, without limitation, if you, directly or indirectly, offer any person a financial or other incentive to use your Referral Link or attempt to redirect traffic from, or divert Referral Rewards from, any other participant in the Referral Program.
You may not use “bots,” “spambots,” “scrapers,” or any program or means designed to automatically send your Referral Link to third parties, or attempt to use your own Referral Link by registering for an additional account with Screencast-O-Matic.
==========
Referring Users and Referred Users will not be eligible to receive any discount if such user violates these Referral Terms or these TOS.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to delay honoring of a Discount while we investigate your participation in the Referral Program or any use of a Referral Link.
==========
Non-Exclusive
The Referral Program is non-exclusive.
You acknowledge and agree that we may, at any time, solicit customer referrals via any method in our sole discretion.
Termination or Suspension of Referral Program
You may stop participating in the Referral Program at any time.
We may, in our sole discretion, suspend, limit, or terminate the Referral Program and terminate these Referral Terms for any reason at any time, with or without providing notice to you.
==========
Termination of the Referral Program and these Referral Terms will not automatically result in the termination of these TOS or your Screencast-O-Matic account, unless otherwise specified by us.
However, termination of these TOS or your Screencast-O-Matic account will result in the automatic termination of your participation in the Referral Program and termination of these Referral Terms.
Upon termination of these Referral Terms, you must immediately cease all use of Referral Links, and any Discounts earned but not used as of the date of termination will remain available, unless we terminate these Referral Terms for your breach of these Referral Terms or these TOS.
Provisions of these Referral Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Referral Terms will survive termination of these Referral Terms.
Privacy
When a Referring User shares their Referral Link with a third party through the Screencast-O-Matic Services, we may collect certain information about such third party as provided by the Referring User.
Please see our Privacy Policy at http://screencast-o-matic.com/privacy for information about how we collect, use, and disclose such information.
