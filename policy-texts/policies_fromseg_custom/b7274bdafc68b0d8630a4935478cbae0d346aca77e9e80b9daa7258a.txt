IMPORTANT--MISCELLANEOUS.
a) Arbitration and Jurisdiction.
Section 2 above provides that your only remedy with respect to any dispute with Court TV is to cancel your Service.
In the event that this limitation of remedies and liability is determined to be inapplicable with respect to any dispute or claim, then you and Court TV agree that the exclusive remedy for all disputes and claims relating in any way to, or arising out of, this Agreement or Services, or your use of the Services or Content shall be final and binding arbitration.
The arbitration shall be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules").
The arbitration shall take place in the State and City of New York.
To the fullest extent permitted by law: no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to any other arbitration, including any arbitration involving any other current or former licensee of Court TV; no class arbitration proceedings shall be permitted; no finding or stipulation of fact in any other arbitration, judicial or similar proceeding may be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between you and Court TV); and no conclusion of law in any other arbitration may be given any weight in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between you and Court TV).

You and Court TV hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State and City of New York to enforce the provisions of this Section 11 and to resolve any disputes and claims cognizable in court relating in any way, or arising out of, this Agreement or Services or your use of the Services or Content.
The court, not the arbitrator, shall determine arbitrability and enforce the arbitration agreements contained herein, including the prohibition on consolidated arbitrations and class arbitration.
