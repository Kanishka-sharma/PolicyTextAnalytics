Maven Coalition, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and its affiliated businesses including Sports Illustrated, TheStreet, HubPages, Inc., and Say Media, Inc. (collectively, “Maven,” “we,” or “us”), offers a digital media platform that allows partners to create and monetize content by allowing Maven and its partners to show advertisements on such content.
We refer to these content creators as “Partners” and to the websites and apps that participate in our coalition as “Partner Content.”
This Privacy Policy explains how Maven collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you visit our websites and Partner Content, open an account or publish content with us, contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.
We collectively refer to these touchpoints as our “Services.”

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification).
We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
==========

If you wish to use the Services, such as to create or post content, comment on other people’s content or to post your own content to Partners’ content, or if you wish to receive updates or newsletters from us or from our Partners, you will be required to create a Maven account.
When you create an account or use our Services, we ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, address, and payment card information (collectively, “Personally Identifiable Information”).
We may also ask for information such as a profile picture or your social profile information.

If your content is supported by advertising or paid subscriptions, we also collect your payment information to allow us to pay you in accordance with your agreement with us.

Between and among our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership, including but not limited to Say Media; and
With your consent or at your direction.
We may also share aggregated information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
