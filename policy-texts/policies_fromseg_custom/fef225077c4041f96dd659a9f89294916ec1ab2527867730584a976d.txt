Privacy Policy

              We periodically rent mailing lists and e-mail lists from magazine 
              publishers and other list owners for advertising purposes that may 
              include your name and address.
We send advertisements hoping you 
              will respond and will verify your name and address with us at checkout 
              so that you can become part of our Micro Center Mailing List.
We maintain your information on our secure server to facilitate 
              checkout at the store, and to help insure you do not receive duplicate 
              advertisements.
==========
PLEASE NOTE: Postal Mail and Electronic Mail are 
              the only ways we have to keep you personally informed of new products, 
              pricing and special offers.
To have your name
                    removed from our lists:
Postal Mail - As a customer, you have the ability 
                    at any time to request not to receive advertisements by so 
                    instructing your cashier (please allow one quarterly mailing 
                    cycle for processing).
Otherwise, you will typically receive 
                    no more than 2 - 3 mailed advertisements per quarter.
You may also request that your home address be deleted from 
                    the mailing lists of some national advertisers by contacting 
                    the Direct Marketing Association directly at www.the-dma.org 
                    and subscribing to their Mail Preference Service.
This process 
                    applies to postal mail only, and typically takes a quarterly 
                    cycle to be put in force.
==========
Electronic Mail - With each e-mail we send, we provide 
                    an easy opportunity to e-mail us back with your preference 
                    not to receive future e-mails.
With the substantial revision 
                    of our websites early in 2000, we will provide an additional 
                    opportunity to add or remove your e-mail address from our 
                    list.
==========
We do not provide anyone outside our company with postal mail information, 
              with only two exceptions:

 We occasionally honor a request for market research purposes.
In such a case, information is limited to name, address and specific 
                product purchased only, and is provided to legitimate 3rd party 
                market research firms only, and for one-time use only.
Micro Center 
                will only approve research that we feel is in the best interest 
                of our customers.
We may provide information to our 3rd party Service Organizations 
                for the purpose of keeping you informed of repair, warranty or 
                product recall issues.
==========
Internal access to customer information is severely limited, and 
              is used for postal mailing and e-mail selection purposes only.
Under 
              no circumstances do we rent or otherwise provide our store postal 
              mailing lists to anyone outside our company for solicitation or 
              advertising purposes.
E-mail addresses will not be provided to anyone else without your 
              prior permission.
November, 1999
