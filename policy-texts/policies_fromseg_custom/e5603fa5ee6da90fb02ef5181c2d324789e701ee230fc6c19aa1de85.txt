==========
The people who work on Find A Grave hate getting unsolicited, junk email (spam) as much as you do.
We also hate lengthy, privacy statements that are impossible to comprehend...that said, here is our promise: we will never, ever share your personal information with any third party.
When you enter your personal information on Find A Grave, you can be assured that we will never share, sell or otherwise distribute this information to anyone ... We collect this information so we may let you know (via email, direct mail, singing telegram or otherwise) about new features or changes to Find a Grave or about related products and services, and because we believe you should receive credit for your Find A Grave contributions... If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can edit your 'contributor page', preventing your email and name from appearing to the public...
