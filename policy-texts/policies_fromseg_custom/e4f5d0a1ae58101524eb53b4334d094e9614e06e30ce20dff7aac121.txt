We use this information purely for the purpose of providing you

==========
You information will be held by the Cookie Collective LLP, which
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Governor Technology Ltd.
Governor employees will only have access to your information
if they need it to provide our services.
We do not generally share this information with any third
parties, except where we use data processors to act on our

details to any other data controller without your express prior
consent unless we are required by law to do so.

The Optanon
Auditor plug-in for Google Chrome gathers data about cookies
and submits it to our database.
This data contains information both about the cookies found, and
the pages on a particular site they were found on.
It also
contains values of cookies, which in some circumstances may contain
personally identifiable information - if the cookie is designed to
hold such information.
Such information is only ever used to
help us identify the purpose of a cookie, where a website owner has
requested this service from us.
The data may also be provided
to the owner of a website if they request it.
We do not use an personally identifiable information for any
other purpose, and nor do we make it available in any other
way.
==========
All submissions of data via the Optanon Auditor plug-in are
otherwise completely anonymous.
No information is collected
about the device the plug-in is installed on, or the person using
the device.
==========
No browsing history, other than a record pf pages
that set cookies, is complied, and no profile linked to a device
can be created from the data.
The names and some attributes of the cookies gathered by the
auditor are made publicly available on the Cookiepedia website.
==========
However there is to our knowledge no personally identifiable
information contained within this data.
Aside from the Optanon Auditor there are two Cookie Collector
plug-ins in circulation which submit data about cookies to our
database.
==========
Although the old Chrome Collector is no longer available for
download, a Firefox Cookie Collector extension is still available
in the Mozilla
Add-ons store.
Both plug-ins if installed will submit data about cookies to our
systems.
==========
They do this automatically, without any kind of user
input, feedback or control.
The Collector submits only names of cookies and their other
attributes, along with the top level domain name of the site being
visited by the browser, when the data was submitted.
The
values (contents) of the cookies are not stored,
nor the specific pages of the site they were found on.
==========
Therefore no personal data is collected.
We
do not identify the source of the data submitted - so it cannot be
used to build up a browsing history of any person using the
Collector.
==========
The sole purpose is to source data about cookies to inform our
research.
Statistics and other intelligence garnered from
analysis of this data are published freely on Cookiepedia.
==========
We are committed to making sure that your information is
secure and treated in accordance with this policy.
We have put in
place suitable procedures to safeguard the information we collect
in order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure.
==========
Cookie Collective LLP is a registered data controller under the
