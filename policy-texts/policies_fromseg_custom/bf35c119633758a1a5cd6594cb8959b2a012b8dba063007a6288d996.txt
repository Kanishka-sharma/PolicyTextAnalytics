GENERAL
  Effective: October 2012
Sirdata (“Sirdata”, www.Sirdata.com) is the provider of data for enhanced online ad targeting services as triggered by “Sirdata Cookies”.
Sirdata Targeting Cookies provide non-personally identifiable preference information (“Sirdata Targeting Data”) that helps advertisers (our customers) specify an ad or a group of ads that are meant to be displayed to a user in the future.
Sirdata Targeting Cookies are based on standard “cookies” (or such other technical formats that may become available in the future) that are created through “pixel tags”.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to a user’s computer when they visit a website.
Cookies are stored as text files on the user’s internet browser, and can be accessed by web servers when the user returns to a website or goes to another website.
Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics.
This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, make the website easier to use, measure the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailor their website to better match a user’s interests and preferences.
Sirdata uses cookies to provide information to advertisers on user web browsing activity such as searches for a specific type of travel information, visits to shopping websites or participation in a social network.
==========
We also may obtain data about you from third-party sources, and may combine it with data that we have collected.
Sirdata cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a user’s hard drive, or to personally identify them.
There are two ways you can stop cookies from being stored on your computer, and therefore, stop Sirdata from using this anonymous information:
1.
Block all cookies (from Sirdata and everybody else) by globally or selectively disabling cookie use in the browser configuration; or

What are pixel tags ?
Pixel tags are small strings of html or JavaScript code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page or other document.
Pixel tags allow the operator of the Web page or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify the Sirdata targeting cookies.
Pixel tags may also be used to obtain information about the computer being used to view that Web page such as the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the time it was sent, the user’s operating system and browser type, and similar information.
We use information collected at various times and by pixel tags and cookies placed on several Web sites in order to deliver our service to advertisers and create a more targeted advertising experience for the user.
==========
As part of its service, Sirdata does NOT collect NOR store any personally identifiable information from Users, such as name, address, telephone number, social security number or e-mail.
As a result, we have no way of tying any of the information we collect back to a particular User.
Some of our Targeted Publishers, Displaying Publishers and Networks may place their own cookies on a user’s internet browser outside of the Sirdata service, however Sirdata has no access to or control over these cookies.
As a matter of policy, Sirdata does not set any targeting cookies based on adult related searches or adult content.
==========
Although some of the data contained in the cookies generated on a user’s internet browser is also written to the Sirdata database, this is done solely in an aggregate form, for reporting, analysis and accounting purposes with Sirdata’s clients.
Sirdata does not obtain or maintain separate data for a given user on its servers.
INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
As described above, Sirdata stores only aggregated data on its servers.
We may share such aggregate, non-personal information with Targeted Publishers, Displaying Publishers, and Networks in connection with reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis.
We disclose Sirdata Targeting Data, and information derived from Sirdata Targeting Data, to our customers in the ordinary course of our business.
We indicate to our customers a user’s membership within a Targeting Data segment at various times.
==========
For example, we may tag an anonymous user as a member of a segment when the user views certain Web pages that are operated or controlled by a Targeted Publisher.
Our customers may use a user’s membership within a segment to display advertisements and other content that are targeted to the user.
Our customers may also use third-party service providers, acting on behalf of those customers, to display advertising or other content that reflects a user’s membership in a segment.
We do not authorize our customers to resell or sub-license Preference Data to third parties.
==========
Targeting Data is to be used for marketing related purposes only.
We may share Sirdata Targeting Data with third-party service providers (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) in order for those service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf.
We may also disclose Sirdata Targeting Data if we believe that we have a legal obligation to do so.
Sirdata policy is to retain our anonymous log file data for up to one year.
This data is kept in an anonymous form and used for analysis purposes only, not for the delivery of any targeted advertisements or other content.
Also, in the event Sirdata is merged into another company, or another company acquires all or substantially all of Sirdata’s assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, all data compiled or owned by Sirdata may be among the items transferred in that transaction.
In such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this Policy.
HOW IS OUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED?
All of the user data collected by Sirdata is stored only in aggregate form, meaning that information about a specific user cannot be retrieved.
==========
Even so, we maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction.
The data is kept on a secure server and we restrict access to the data solely to authorized users.
No security measures, however thorough, are perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess.
