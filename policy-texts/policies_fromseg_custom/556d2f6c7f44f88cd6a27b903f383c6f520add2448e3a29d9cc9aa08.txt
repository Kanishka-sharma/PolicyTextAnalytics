Inc.com is committed to maintaining the trust of our users.
This statement explains how we collect information from you and what we do with it.
==========
Information Requests
Inc.com offers a variety of online resources.
In order for you to make full use of the resources on our site, we ask you to provide some basic information.
==========
When you sign up to receive an inc.com newsletter, you will be asked for your e-mail address.
If you wish to participate in other inc.com services, such as Discussions, create a BizCard or to access free tools, you will be asked to register for My inc.com.
You'll give us a user name, password and e-mail address so that you can use the personalized features on our site.
Promotions
Unless you opt out, we may use your My inc.com registration information to send you promotional materials that we think may interest you.
We do not provide or sell user names, e-mail addresses or registration information to any outside organization.
Shopping at inc.com
Inc.com provides shopping services through the help of third-party vendors.
==========
We provide these vendors with certain information about you (e.g. your credit card number and street address) solely for the purpose of authorizing the transaction and processing and delivering your order.
The transactions are carried out through a secure server using appropriate encryption in order to protect the security of this information.
Any customer service rep who needs access to your credit card information in order to deal with your order will be bound by a confidentiality agreement that prohibits his or her disclosure of that information.
==========
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that most Web sites, including inc.com, place on your computer.
Cookies help us identify your interests.
==========
They also prevent you from having to register repeatedly on inc.com or from repeatedly seeing the same ads.
Cookies delivered to you through banner ads are collected by our advertisers.
==========
We don't have access to any specific information they may provide.
Those serving banner ads on our site only provide us with information in aggregate form.
No individual information is given to us.
==========
Inc.com is not able, and does not wish, to use cookies to track your activities on the Web outside of our site.
No cookie delivered by us will interfere with the operation of your computer.
==========
Shared Information
Except as described above or as expressly stated at the time you provide information to inc.com, inc.com does not provide individual information about you to others.
We do, however, receive information on individual users from our partners, who have assured us that they will notify users of their sites that they do so.
You should review the privacy policies of these partner sites in order to confirm the way in which they handle their users' information.
In those instances where our sharing of information is expressly noted at the time you provide it, we may provide that information to those partners specified in the notice.
The use of this information by that partner will then be subject to the partner's privacy policies.
Inc.com may share information gathered from its users, in aggregate form, with others such as advertisers or sponsors.
No individual information is provided.
General Considerations
Inc.com cannot guarantee that the information you provide to us is completely safe, although we are careful to try to prevent problems.
==========
There may be technical problems beyond our control that may make it accessible to unauthorized persons.
There also may be visitors to the site who gather and use information available there, such as that provided by you on your BizCard or in Discussions.
==========
If inc.com is acquired, our user information will be included among the assets transferred to the buyer in the sale.
There also may be occasions on which inc.com is required to provide information by order of a court or when the law requires that user information be treated as a transferable asset, as in bankruptcy.
==========
Internet-based commerce is dynamic and changing.
We may change our privacy policy in the future in order to adjust to these changes.
==========
We recommend that you check it frequently.
