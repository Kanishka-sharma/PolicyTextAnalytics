NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
Effective January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires that, if a business has an established business relationship with a California resident and has within the immediately preceding calendar year shared such resident’s personal information with any third party for such third party’s direct marketing purposes, then the business must disclose such information-sharing to the resident upon request, including what personal information was shared, and with whom it was shared.
However, a business is deemed in compliance with the foregoing if: (1) it has a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer’s personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the customer’s consent (either opt-in or opt-out); and (2) it provides the customer upon request with a notice of his/her choice to prevent such sharing and a cost-free means to exercise that choice.
As a general matter, consent by “opt-in” means that a business will not share a customer’s personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer affirmatively consents to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest consent).
On the other hand, consent by “opt-out” means that a business may share a customer’s personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer expressly disallows or objects to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest disallowance or objection).
As a non-profit, we DO NOT knowingly share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use.
California residents may request an information-sharing disclosure from us by emailing your request to legal@ck12.org.
Please note that, under the law, we are not required to respond to your request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any requests that are not sent to the above-designated email address.

PROTECTING CHILDREN
The CK-12 Platform is not designed or intended for children under the age of 13.
Accordingly, children under the age of 13 will not be permitted to register or make any User Postings (as defined in the Terms of Use) on the CK-12 Platform.
If we discover that any registration or User Posting is made by an underage child, such registration or User Posting will be immediately and permanently canceled and removed from the CK-12 Platform, with or without notice.
We urge parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in and monitor the online activities of their children.

If you are a Member, we may also notify you of the changes via email and may ask you to affirmatively consent to and accept the changes at the time of your next account login on the CK-12 Platform.
