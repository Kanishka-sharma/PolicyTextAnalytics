How does Hulu use and share aggregate data?
How we use aggregate data.
Aggregate data is information that we collect on an individualized basis (for example, statistics about which videos you watch) but subsequently use in aggregate form (that is, in a way that combines information about individuals together so that no individual is identifiable).
We may use aggregate data for a variety of purposes, including for research or analysis, website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes.
How we share aggregate data.
We may share aggregate information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities.
==========
For example, IP addresses are used for system administration and to provide anonymous aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Hulu Services and the specific Hulu Services in which users are most interested.
We also may share information about our users with advertisers so they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the Hulu Services.
For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.

==========
Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser.
Cookies remember information about your activities on a website or other platform.
For example, cookies can store your session for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited.

For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, cookie or clickstream data about your activities using the Hulu Services may allow us to limit the materials we send to you to items that we believe will be of interest to you, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
==========
You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain Hulu Services.

Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.
By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer.

We also may use services that collect data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags"), which can be embedded in content and advertising on the Hulu Services, in an email message, or on a third party's website or other platform.
A Pixel Tag is a small string of code that provides a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email.
Pixel Tags can recognize certain types of information on your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed.
