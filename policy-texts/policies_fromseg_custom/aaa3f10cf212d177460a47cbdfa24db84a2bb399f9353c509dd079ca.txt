Traffic Data.
Like most website and mobile application operators, CheckPeople automatically gathers information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) Internet domain names; (iii) types of devices accessing the Service; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively "Traffic Data").
Traffic Data is anonymous information that is not meant to personally identify you.
==========
Cookie Policy.
"Cookies" are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open.
Cookies store a string of information on a user's computer or mobile device, which the user's web browser provides to the Service automatically each time it interacts with the Service.
The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service.
CheckPeople uses two types of Cookies: "first-party cookies" and "third-party cookies."
First Party Cookies.
==========
CheckPeople uses first-party Cookies on the Service, for example the Google Analytics Cookie, for the following purposes: (1) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests; and (2) to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.
If you do not wish to have first-party Cookies placed on your computer or mobile device, you should set your web browser to refuse Cookies before accessing the Service.
==========
However, certain features of the Service may not function properly without the aid of Cookies.
If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
==========
Third Party Cookies and Advertising.
Advertising on Third Party Websites.
CheckPeople may advertise on other Third Party Websites to you after you access the Service.
We and third-party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, Inc. ("Google"), may use first party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), third party Cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie), and web beacons (such as the Facebook conversion tracking pixel, see https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/conversion-tracking), including across multiple devices, to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to you based on your use of the Service.
==========
This practice is commonly known as retargeting or remarketing (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting).
Google Analytics.
Google Analytics is Google's analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties.
==========
It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google.
The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the "__ga" cookie.
CheckPeople uses Google Analytics on the CheckPeople.com website.
==========
Data Collection by Third Parties.
Any of these third parties may place Cookies on your computer or mobile device, use web beacons (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon), and gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to deliver relevant metrics and content.
Opting Out of Third Party Cookies.
