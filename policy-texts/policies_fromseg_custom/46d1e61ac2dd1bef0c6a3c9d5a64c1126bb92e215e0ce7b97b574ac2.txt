Online Services ApplicationsOnline Services Applications
Some Online Services may require, or may be enhanced by, the installation of local software (e.g., agents, device management applications) (“Apps”).
This section of the Microsoft Online Services Privacy Statement governs your use of those Microsoft Apps that do not have their own privacy statements.
At your or your end user’s direction, the Apps transmit data, which may include Customer Data from a device or appliance to or from the Online Services.
The Apps may collect other information about the use and performance of the Apps that may be transmitted to Microsoft and analyzed for purposes of improving the quality, security, and integrity of Microsoft products or services.
Some Apps may have logging capabilities that permit you to transmit data to Microsoft or to the Online Services for troubleshooting purposes.

Microsoft will not disclose Customer Data to law enforcement unless required by law.
==========
Should law enforcement contact Microsoft with a demand for Customer Data, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from you.
If compelled to disclose Customer Data to law enforcement, then Microsoft will promptly notify you and provide you a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so.
Upon receipt of any other third party request for Customer Data (such as requests from customer’s end users), Microsoft will promptly notify you unless prohibited by law.
If Microsoft is not required by law to disclose the Customer Data, Microsoft will reject the request.
If the request is valid and Microsoft could be compelled to disclose the requested information, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the third party to request the Customer Data from you.
Except as customer directs, Microsoft will not provide any third party: (1) direct, indirect, blanket or unfettered access to Customer Data; (2) the platform encryption keys used to secure Customer Data or the ability to break such encryption; or (3) any kind of access to Customer Data if Microsoft is aware that such data is used for purposes other than those stated in the request.
In support of the above, Microsoft may provide your basic contact information to the third party.
We will not disclose Administrator Data, Payment Data or Support Data outside of Microsoft or its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates except (1) as you direct, (2) with permission from an end user, (3) as described here or in your agreement(s), or (4) as required by law.

The Online Services may enable you to purchase, subscribe to, or use services, software, and content from companies other than Microsoft ("Third Party Offerings").
If you choose to purchase, subscribe to, or use a Third Party Offering, we may provide the third party with your Administrator Data or Payment Data to enable the third party to provide its offering to you (and subject to your contact preferences, send you promotional communications).
Use of that information and your use of a Third Party Offering will be governed by the third party’s privacy statement and policies.
