In such cases, the billing by a Website Operator different from the one Member is contracted with shall not result in any change for the use of the Website services by the Member and will not result in any additional fee nor loss of credits or of rights for the Member.
Irrespective of such billing on behalf as the case may be, the Member shall, at all times, be deemed to be contracted with the Website Operator based on earlier localization (exception made of a change of permanent place of residence as separately notified to the Website Operator).
The Member authorizes such billing arrangement as the case may be.

5.15.
==========
LiveJasmin.com will only compensate/refund credits in the amount proportionally determined in accordance to the price paid and problem effectively reported when any credit is lost due to dysfunction of LiveJasmin.com or an Adult Service Provider (ASP) in the “Nude Only” part of the site totally and explicitly refuses to provide erotic content.
In case some erotic content is provided, LiveJasmin.com will assess the situation and decide whether the claim of customer is grounded and any compensation/refund of credits is due.
Models in Hot Flirt category are free to choose the rate of erotic content in private shows.
==========

Models of this category are not required to provide erotic content, but during private show they are allowed if they agree on it.
==========
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, every Subscriber shall be made aware that when he/she is considered as First Member (such term as defined below), it is recommended for him/her to indicate and/or repeat any specific request towards an Adult Service Provider (“ASP”) from the onset of the private chat in case the private show is not in line with his/her expectations, also allow enough time for the ASP to meet such request.
Merits of Subscriber’s claims for refund based on unmet requests will not be considered if the Subscriber (as First Member, such term as defined below) fails to follow the above recommendation.
The subscriber(s) shall further understand and accept that when joining an already ongoing Private show initiated by another subscriber (the latter being referred to as the “First Member”), the subscriber(s) that is/are subsequently joining such performance (the “Subsequent Member(s)”) is/are deemed passive participant(s) to the extent that the service provider(s)/Model(s) is/are only required to follow First Member’s requests.
As a result and in such cases, the Subsequent Member(s) shall not be entitled to any compensation or payment refund, exception made of LiveJasmin.com malfunction that can be properly demonstrated by the Subsequent Member(s).
==========
Besides the Private Chat, the Subscribers may also contact the Adult Service Providers (“ASP”) via offline chat messages or, if the ASP is available, through a Video/Voice Call.
Please note that Subscribers may not make specific requests to an ASP via a Video/Voice call.
5.16.
==========
Due to the payment system applied by the Website Operator and third-party payment processors and provided that cash refund conditions are met, cash refunds shall only apply for the same amount as that originally paid upon a certain credits package purchase provided that the related credits balance has not been used or spent, even partially.
As a result, no partial cash refund of credit packages bought is ever possible.
This therefore means that whenever a credits package balance is partially used (including credit rewards), a refund may only take place in the form of credits (and not cash) up to existing prior credits balance, subject to eligibility conditions.
Eligible cash refunds, will be processed using the same payment method applied to the credits package originally purchased and for which the refund is requested.
As a result of a cash refund, the corresponding amount of credits will then be deducted from your account's balance.
You shall remain aware that certain payment methods do not allow any refund due to underlying technical restrictions pertaining to their use.
5.17.
==========
Amounts spent on related services, such as VIP show tickets, Buy My Content and/or Surprise, Sneak Peek and/or Snapshot feature, Messenger and/or offline/private messages, Video/Voice Calls, MyStory subscription, are not subject to refund/compensation.
Snapshot(s) of a Performer shall remain visible as long as such Performer account is active and not closed on the website.

5.19.
Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall LiveJasmin.com or any of its related, affiliated companies be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use the service, without prejudice of the established in the present clause.

==========
The website and all of its features must be used at all times in line with their purpose and intended use.
