You can see our previous Privacy Policy here.
We — meaning Formagrid, Inc., doing business as Airtable (also "Airtable," "we," "our," or "us") — prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand our practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of information we collect from you through Airtable’s web or mobile applications, our hosted services, our websites that link to this Privacy Policy, and any other services we provide to our customers or end users (collectively, the "Services").
1.
==========
What Information We Collect
We may collect information from you when you:
Create or register an account, or administer your account
Input, post, or upload information, data, or other content through the Services
Submit questions, requests, or other communications to us via various communication channels
Contact us for customer support or technical support
Visit any of our websites or download any of our applications
Participate in any promotions, demonstrations, contests, surveys, or other marketing events
Interact with other Airtable users and guests on our community forums
Integrate third-party products and services with your Airtable account
Below is additional information that we may collect from you, depending on how you interact with the Services:
a. Your Content
You (and anyone who can interact with your use of the Services) own and control the nature of the information, data, and other content you input, post, or upload through the Services ("Content"), subject to any applicable terms and conditions.
Our collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to Content are distinct from those with respect to other sorts of information, as explained in Section 2.
a. below.
==========
We may upload Content automatically with your authorization from third-party service providers (such as from your Google Drive).
b. Customer Information
Information related to the creation of accounts or that otherwise identifies you as a customer or end user of the Services is what we call "Customer Information."
Customer Information may include personal information, such as your name, email address, gender, postal address, phone number and payment card information.
==========
If you are an end user using the Services through an account created on your behalf by an Airtable customer (such as an employer, an organization of which you are a member, or another individual), we may collect and process Customer Information about you on behalf of the Airtable customer with whom your use of the Services is associated.
When you create an account with Airtable, we may collect certain Customer Information directly from you or, if you create your account using a third-party service such as Google, Apple, or a single-sign-on service such as Okta, we may collect Customer Information about you from the third-party service (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service).
By choosing to create an account using a third-party service, you authorize us to collect Customer Information necessary to authenticate your account with the third-party service provider.
==========
Certain aspects of the Services allow you to link or integrate third-party products and services to enable certain features and functionalities with the Services.
For example, you can connect your Google Drive account to generate Content in Airtable from information and data contained in your Google Drive or integrate with third-party services using Airtable Apps.
If you choose to use these features or functionalities, you may be asked to create an account with a third-party service provider or link your existing account with that service provider (and, by doing so, agree to the privacy policy and/or terms and conditions of that third-party).
You may also be asked to authorize Airtable to collect information from the third-party service provider on your behalf.
We will then collect information (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service) from you and/or that third-party service provider as necessary to enable the Services to access your data and content stored with that third-party service provider.
Once the authentication is complete, we have the ability to access information you provided to us or was otherwise collected by the third-party service in accordance with the privacy practices of that third-party service.
We will store the information and data we collect and associate it with your Airtable account, and we will use that information and data to enable the integration of the Services with the third-party service provider and to perform actions requested or initiated by you, or that are reasonably necessary to carry out instructions provided by you.
==========
c. Automatically-Collected Information
We collect information about how you use the Services and your actions on the Services, including your IP addresses, browser types, operating systems, ISPs, platform types, device types, mobile device identifiers such as make and model, and mobile carrier.
We may also use tools, including third-party tools, to collect analytics data.
Some of this information is collected through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, session replay scripts, and similar technologies ("tracking technologies").
We may also work with third-party partners to employ cookies and tracking technologies.
For example, we may work with online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services that use cookies, tracking technologies, or other information about your use of our Services over time in order to display personalized or interest-based ads on the Services, on other websites, through apps or services you may use, and on other devices you may use.
We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.
Certain tracking technologies we use are related to advertising networks, and through those technologies we may share certain information such as IP addresses.
Please note that the information we share with those advertising networks might be combined with other information about you that those networks may have collected from other sources.
Our uses of cookies and tracking technologies fall into the following general categories:
Operationally Necessary.
==========
This includes tools and technologies that allow you access to our Services; are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; and allow you to make use of our functionality;
Performance Related.
We may use technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use the Services;
Functionality Related.
We may use technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services, including, for example, identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;
Advertising or Targeting Related.

We may use first-party or third-party technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third-party sites.

How to Opt Out of Online Advertising in Internet Browser
We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for online behavioral advertising ("Principles") published by the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA").
This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes.
More information about these Principles can be found at www.aboutads.info.
==========
If you want to opt out of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and third parties that participate in the DAA program and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, please following the instructions at: www.aboutads.info/choices, or www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
If you’re in the EU, you can find additional information about your choices with respect to advertising networks and online behavioral advertising by clicking here: www.youronlinechoices.com.
When you elect to opt-out through these sites, they will place an opt-out cookie on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.
Opt-out cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto.
If you want to opt out of interest-based advertisements across all your browsers and devices, you will need to opt out on each browser on each device you actively use.
==========
If you delete cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt out again.
And some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies.
If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.
Disabling cookies may limit your ability to use the Services.

We also may use certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Universal Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Doubleclick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the online Services.

It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests.
We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-party’s opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of any third-party’s statements regarding their programs.
