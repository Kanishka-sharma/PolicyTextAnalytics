We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.
Because we gather certain types of information about our users, 
we feel you should fully understand our policy and
the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.
This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions.
These are voluntary submissions 
to contact a press release author,

throughout our site.

==========
Usage Tracking
We track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites.
However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users.
We do break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME
type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
==========
We track number of unique visitors for each press release to display the most popular press releases on top.
We sometimes track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our Search function, 
but this tracking is never associated with individual users.
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't
like based on traffic to those areas.
We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall.
This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
==========
Cookies
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer.
The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use
of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.
But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.
A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).
==========
Use of Information
We use any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites,
whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites
or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.
As stated above, we use information that
users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters
and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards,
and forums.
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and 
don't like based on traffic to those areas.
We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall.
==========
This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users.
But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
==========
We create aggregate reports
on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors
and partners.
This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,
and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to
their needs.
Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual
users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user
clicked their ad.
We will not disclose any information about any individual
user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or
to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
Sharing of the Information
We don't share any voluntary or non-voluntary information gathered by us
by means other than explained above.
We have third party web service providers to display ads on our website.
