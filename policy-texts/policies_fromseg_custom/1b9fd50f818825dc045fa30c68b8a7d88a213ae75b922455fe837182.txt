Residents of California have the following privacy rights:
THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT
The California Consumer Privacy Act provides that California residents may (subject to certain limitations): 
Request the personal information we collect about them.
Ask that we delete the personal information we collect about them.
Opt out of having their personal information sold (while we do not share personal information with third parties in exchange for money, we disclose certain information in exchange for insights and other valuable services, and California law treats such sharing as a “sale” even if no money is exchanged; click here for more information).

CALIFORNIA'S SHINE THE LIGHT LAW
California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies once a year what personal information they share with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes.
California residents may make one Shine the Light request per year by emailing us at privacy@homedepot.com.
When you request the information, use the phrase “California Shine the Light Request” to help us appropriately identify your question, and include your mailing address, state of residence and email address so we can provide a response.
For additional information about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, please see our Privacy and Security Statement.
