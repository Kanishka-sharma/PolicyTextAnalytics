You are not authorized to access any Subscription Services unless you (i) have opened a subscription account with the NHL (or, in Canada, with Rogers), and paid the appropriate fee; (ii) have received access credentials (including a username and password), and (iii) are using those access credentials.
You may not assist anyone else in accessing Subscription Services on an unauthorized basis, including by sharing, selling, publicly offering, or offering to sell your access credentials or providing any content or other materials that you obtained through Subscription Services to third parties or otherwise in violation of these Terms.

For some devices, the payment for Subscription Services may be processed by the device provider.
Those payments will be governed by the device provider's terms, including its cancellation and refund policy.
Other restrictions, including restrictions on the availability of the devices or the Subscription Services in certain countries, may apply.

In connection with any subscription option that provides for automatic renewal, you will be notified by email that your subscription will be automatically renewed for the following subscription period (at the full season price for NHL GameCenter LIVE™) in effect for such renewal period (unless the NHL notifies you to the contrary) and at that time you will be given the opportunity to cancel your subscription by a prescribed deadline.
If you do not cancel your subscription by the prescribed deadline, then your subscription will automatically renew, and your credit or debit card on file will be charged.

By using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories, or jurisdictions.
With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Services or these Terms (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), the NHL and you agree to negotiate in good faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution.
If you and the NHL do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section.
==========
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.

No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
==========
The NHL and you agree that all disputes arising under these Terms that cannot be settled through informal negotiation will be settled exclusively through confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial rules of arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in New York.
The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.
You agree that the NHL may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
Any claims not subject to arbitration shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of state or federal courts in New York County, New York.
==========
To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under these Terms must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding.
The one-year period begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed.
If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.

NHL Services Purchased through the Apple App Store; Apple Not a Party
If you have purchased the Services from Apple Inc. ("Apple"), you acknowledge that these Terms are an agreement between you and the NHL and not with Apple.
As between the NHL and Apple, the NHL (not Apple) is solely responsible for the Services and the NHL Content.
Any Services obtained through Apple's App Store must be used only on an iOS device that you own or control, as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service.
You acknowledge and agree that Apple is not responsible for (i) providing any maintenance or support services with respect to the Services and that, as between the NHL and Apple, the NHL (not Apple) is responsible for providing such maintenance and support services; or (ii) any claims related to the Services or your possession and/or use thereof (including product liability claims, infringement claims, claims that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation), and that, as between the NHL and Apple, the NHL (not Apple) is responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such claims.
In the event of any failure of the Services purchased through the App Store to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund you any access fee paid by you for those Services.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligations whatsoever with respect to the App and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty, as between Apple and the NHL, will be the NHL's sole responsibility.
You further represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce them against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
