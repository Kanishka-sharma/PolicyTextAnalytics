What about your California Privacy Rights?
==========
California’s “Shine the Light” law entitles California residents who provide their personal information to us in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use to obtain from us information about any customer information we have shared with other businesses for their direct marketing uses, including the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year.
California law permits you to obtain such information from us once per calendar year.
We are not required to provide the above-described information as long as we adopt and disclose a privacy policy under which we do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you first affirmatively agree to the disclosure.
Accordingly, we are only required to notify you of the right to prevent disclosure of your personal information and providing a cost-free means for you to exercise that right.
==========
Sojern does not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure as stated above in this Privacy Policy.
If we do share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and you authorize us to include your information, we will only share that information in connection with that specific promotion.
To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on our Site or the Service.
If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your personal information, you will need to contact the third party directly.
California customers can receive more information about our compliance with this law by visiting our Contact Us page, or by writing to us at:

Sojern, Inc. (“Sojern,” “We,” “Us,” and “Our”) provides advertisements, offers, and other content that we think will be of interest to you.
==========
Earning your trust is important to us—it’s a responsibility we take seriously.
This Advertising Privacy Policy applies to our targeted advertising services, the information we receive from the websites of our marketing partners (collectively, the “Sites”), or that we may obtain from the use of cookies (as defined below) as you surf the Internet (collectively, our “Services”).

The latest version will always be posted here.
For this reason, please check back regularly for the most recent version of our Advertising Privacy Policy.

We may work with marketing partners whose privacy policy allows them to share non-personally identifiable information about their customers and/or inquirers, such as demographic data, consumer interests, participation levels, purchase behavior, and/or user-generated content.
As stated above, we do not receive PII from, or provide PII to, our marketing partners.
The non-personally identifiable information which we may receive allows us to analyze and understand more about our marketing partners' customers and what they might be interested in.
This allows us to target and deliver more relevant advertisements, offers, and other content to these customers as they interact with the marketing partner’ website or surf the Internet, benefiting our marketing partner, the customer, and the advertiser or content provider.

We do not use cookies to obtain PII.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any PII you submit while on the Sites.
