Your Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account
2.3.1.
Upon completing the YouGov Registration Process, Members will be provided with a profile ("Panel Membership Profile") and an account ("YouGov Account") for those YouGov Panels and YouGov Activities (related to a particular YouGov Panel) for which Credit (as defined below) is awarded.

==========
Credit accrued in secondary YouGov Accounts may not be transferred.
YouGov may demand proof of identity in the event of a dispute.
2.3.3.

A unique email address must be used by each Member.
(For example, this means that family members may not each have an account using a shared email address but must each have a separate account with a separate email address.)

==========
Each Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account must only be accessed by an individual Member, and may not be accessed by any other individual without the express permission and authorisation of YouGov.
You agree to notify YouGov immediately you become aware of, or suspect any unauthorised use of your login information, Panel Membership Profile and/or YouGov Account, or any other breach of security.

2.3.7.

A Member's failure to correctly follow any required instructions or procedures may result in no Credit being earned, for which the Member will have no recourse against YouGov.

Credit has no monetary value, and cannot be used for any purpose other than redeeming the designated reward.

YouGov may from time to time adjust a Member's YouGov Account upwards or downwards in response to errors which Members acknowledge may arise or suspected fraud, for which we have full authority.

3.
==========
Non-personal information we collect 
3.1 Without registration for a YouGov panel, the only information we may collect is non-personal information through the use of Cookies, web beacons or similar analytics-driven technologies.
3.2 As is true of most digital services, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
Usage and Referral Information: We also collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services.
This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on.
==========
Additionally, like most digital services today, we keep digital log files that record data each time a device accesses our servers.
The log files contain data about the nature of each access.
We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
==========
We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
If you arrive at a YouGov service from an external source (such as a link on another website or contained in an email), we may use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, administer the site, track users, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Cookies: We may use "cookies" to collect the information referred to and track your use of our site.
A cookie is a text file containing a small amount of information that is sent to your browser when you visit a website.
The cookie is then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises it.
Cookies are an extremely useful technology and do lots of different jobs.
==========
We use various types of cookies (including some that we place and others which we permit third parties to place on our site) for a number of purposes.
The information collected by Cookies allows us to monitor how many people are using our services and their interactions with other services, how many people open our e-mails, and determine for what purposes these actions are being taken.
Cookies are also used to facilitate a user's log-in, as navigation aids, and as session timers, and to restrict underage use of YouGov tools and services.
==========
We also use Cookies to match non-personally identifiable information to third-party databases to create anonymized marketing profiles that could result in you seeing customized advertising or content when browsing the internet.
We do not link non-personal information from Cookies to personally identifiable information without permission, and we do not use Cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information.
If for any reason you do not want us to track your use of our site using cookies, you can opt out of this using your browser settings and can also select the option “Do Not Track” (for more information please refer to your browser).
Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
==========
For more information about "cookies", why we use them and how to refuse cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.
Web Beacons: We also may use web beacons to collect non-personal information about the use of our services.
The information collected by web beacons allows us to monitor how many people are using our services, how many people open our e-mails, and determine for what purposes these actions are being taken.
Our web beacons are not used to track activity outside of our services.
We do not link non-personal information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without permission and do not use web beacons to collect or store personally identifiable Information.
4.
Digital tracking and your preferences
4.1 YouGov takes all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of visitors to our website, but we cannot promise that the current limitations of the software that runs our website will address every browser setting or honour every personal browser preference.
As the capabilities of our software improves, we will take all reasonable steps to honour such requests in the future.
==========
Please return to this privacy policy for further updates on this topic.
4.2 Further, our digital media service providers and business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across digital media platforms.
We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on other digital media services that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those websites.
5.
==========
Communicating with you
5.1 By becoming a YouGov Member, you agree to allow us to communicate with you via email or sms in relation to your membership of the YouGov panel(s) and opportunities to participate in YouGov activities.
These include but are not limited to communications relating to:

YouGov polls;
YouGov Pulse (our digital monitoring technology);
YouGov Online (Opigram) (the interactive element of our websites);
other forms of YouGov research;
YouGov research results; and
YouGov newsletters;

6.
Where do we transfer your information to?
6.1  Your information may be accessed and processed by our staff, service providers, affiliates or agents located in any of our offices around the world.
6.2  Please do not send us your information if you do not agree to it being transferred outside the EEA in this way.
By providing your information to us you agree and consent to us transferring to, and storing your information in any of our offices around the world.
If you do not agree to this then you should unsubscribe from the YouGov panel.
7.
==========
Who do we share your information with?
7.1  We may share your information with any companies in our group and other branches of YouGov for internal reporting purposes.
7.2  We may share your information with other organisations:
7.2.1        who provide services to us so that they can provide the services we request.
This might include IT service providers who support our IT systems, for example;
7.2.2        who we provide services to so that they can benefit from the services we provide.
==========
Whilst we will, where possible, take steps to ensure that you cannot be identified from that information, as we cannot ever fully understand what information our clients may already hold about you, it may be that they can link the anonymous information that we provide, to other information which then enables them to identify you.
By way of example:

if you have given us your Twitter username we may share tweets posted by you and your followers to third parties and, while we will not disclose your Twitter handle, it may be that either (a) information contained within those feeds alone could identify you or a third party or (b) those tweets could be linked with other information the third party already holds which then enables them to identify you or someone else; or
we may exchange what we consider to be anonymous or pseudonymised information about our panellists with third parties who will use it for analysis purposes, to enhance their own databases, to model audiences and track the efficiency of campaigns, and to gain an insight into behaviours so that they can develop strategies which add value to their, or their clients’ businesses.
For this purpose, we may also collect anonymised information from third parties which we can use to identify you.
As our clients and, in turn their clients, will have their own databases and other sources of information, it may be that they could link the anonymous information we provide with information they already have and therefore identify you; or
we may provide limited personal details to trusted third party data processors for the purposes of combining our data with other third party data sources.
The final combined data set will be anonymised and non-attributable.
7.2.3        if we sell or buy any business or assets, (as we may share your data with the prospective seller or buyer);
7.2.4        if we or substantially all of our company assets are acquired by another party, in which case your information will be one of the transferred assets; or
7.2.5        if we have to share your information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements (or we reasonably believe that we need to disclose your information for such purposes), or if we have to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use or any other terms and conditions or agreements or to protect our rights, property or our customers etc.
7.3  Other than as listed above, we will not rent, sell or otherwise disclose your information without your consent.
7.4  Please bear in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal data online - for example on message boards, on a blog or chat area - that information will be viewed by others.
8.
==========
How do we keep your information secure?
8.1  All your information is stored on secure servers that are owned or leased by us.
8.2  Any payment transactions will be made via BACS.
==========
8.3  If you have a username, password or other login details which enable you to access certain parts of our site, you must not allow any other person to use them and must treat them as confidential.
If you believe or suspect that someone else knows your login details you must contact us at supportuk@yougov.com as soon as possible.
Please also see our Terms and Conditions of Use.
==========
8.4  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will apply our normal procedures and comply with legal requirements to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
==========
8.5  Our site may from time to time contain links to and from other websites.
If you follow a link to any of those sites, please note that those sites ought to have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those sites or for their privacy policies.
Please check those privacy policies before you submit your information to those sites.
Please also see our Terms and Conditions of Use for further provisions relating to other websites.

==========
Your Rights
You have the right to access your personal information and should direct any request for your information to us at supportuk@yougov.com.
Please note that a fee of ten pounds (£10.00) may be payable to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
It is also important to note that, while you can request your information at any time, we continuously ask our panellists to update information about themselves and so there will be opportunities to review your details throughout the year.
9.1  Due to the nature of our activities and our need to take a snapshot of views and opinions at a particular moment in time, it is not possible to amend any responses to surveys, focus groups, online forum, YouGov online, YouGov Pulse or tweets which you make (where you have provided your username).
9.2  If you have a complaint about how we have used your information, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office.

What are cookies?
1.1  A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your computer or other device to allow a website to recognise you as a user when you return to the website using the same computer and web browser, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (a ‘persistent cookie’).

What are cookies used for?
2.1  Cookies are an extremely common technology for remembering certain information about a visitor to a website.
The vast majority of websites currently make use of cookies and they are commonly used for a wide range of tasks.
We use cookies for the following purposes:
2.1.1        as necessary for website operation, for example to enable you to login to your account or place an order;
2.1.2        to analyse the use of the Site by, for example, recognising and counting the number of visitors and how they move around the Site.
This helps us to see what parts of the site are popular and which sections need improving to make the experience better for users;
2.1.3        to recognise you when you return to the Site so that content can be personalised for you, for example, by remembering your country and site preferences;
2.1.4        to record your visit to the Site and the pages you have visited and links you have followed.
We will use this to make the Site more relevant to your interests;
2.1.5        to monitor, and permit third parties to monitor the effectiveness of advertising campaigns; and
2.1.6        to enable us, and third parties, to create target segments for advertising purposes.

Google Analytics
 
 
 
 


The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
These are the four main cookies set by the Google Analytics service which enables us to track visitor behaviour and measure performance of our Site (_utma, _utmb, _utmc and _utmz).
Other cookies are associated with the Google Analytics service which enable us to understand how users are interacting with our Site (utmccn, utmcmd, utmctr and utmcct).
The Google Analytics cookies expire when you close your browser (with the exception of the _utmb cookie which expires after 30 minutes).
The _utmb cookie is updated every time data is sent to Google Analytics.

Any activity by a user within the 30 minute life span will count as a single visit, even if the user leaves and then returns to the site.
A return after 30 minutes will count as a new visit from a returning visitor.

6.2  You can delete the pixel by deleting the email.
If you do not wish to download the pixel to your computer or other device, you can ensure this by selecting to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.
