Advertising, Content Serving and Web Analytics Technology
Cerebroad’s technology is used by its customers—advertising agencies, advertisers and publishers—to create and deliver rich and diverse online marketing campaigns using modern technology and innovative tools.
Cerebroad supports strict online privacy and security standards and has implemented several techniques to monitor advertising material for potentially unsafe content and unlawful privacy breaches.
Cerebroad continuously educates advertisers, agencies and partners to ensure that these parties are aware of and vigilant in preventing any security or privacy breaches that could affect you, media sites or other parties.
==========
Cerebroad’s technology allows advertisers to collect and store data about Internet users and use them for analysis and online behavioral advertisements.
As a result, such advertisements offer an enriched online experience and deliver advertisement content that is likely to be more interesting and relevant to Internet users.
Data Collection by Cerebroad
When you visit a website or mobile application that shares non-personal information about your activity with Cerebroad, we will use that information to help our clients to deliver more relevant advertising to you at the websites and mobile applications you visit, and for other purposes including research and analysis.
To decide which ads to display, such as showing similar products to those a visitor has looked at before, Cerebroad uses a cookie mechanism for this purpose, but only on an anonymous basis.
A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on a computer or mobile device when, with a browser, a user views advertisements or websites of one of Cerebroad’s clients.
==========
The cookie does not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or anything similar that identifies an individual.
Instead the cookie contains: a random identification number, opt-out or opt-in choice options, or information about campaign/advertisement activity on an advertiser’s site.
Using the cookies’ random identification numbers, Cerebroad collects and stores in the cookie-based profiles anonymous information such as: device type, operating system, browser version, geographic location, URLs on which Cerebroad displays advertisements, or facts about interactions with advertisements (such as number of clicks or views).
During web requests to Cerebroad web-servers, our system is exposed to the IP addresses and/or Mobile Device Identifiers of user devices.
Cerebroad is in full compliance with local data privacy laws and is anonymising the data according to local regulations.
Usage of Collected Data for Advertisements
The collected data can be used in different ways for online behavioural advertisements.
==========
They can be used for the following tasks: displaying ads in a sequence, displaying particular products in response to interest, displaying ads based on statistical probabilities, or deciding if an ad should be shown based on responses to the above techniques.
Display Ads in a Sequence
First, ads can be shown in a sequence by using a cookie with a random identification number.
By remembering which ads have been shown to each number, Cerebroad offers advertisers the possibility to only show the same ad a specific number of times, before showing other or no ads.
Display Particular Products in Response to Interest
Based on the random identification number in the cookie, Cerebroad for a certain period stores the information that interest was shown in a particular product or advertiser in terms of, for example, a click, visit, mouse-over, search or similar interaction tracked by the advertiser.
Based on this information, the advertiser can create ads that display the same or similar products of possible interest.
Therefore, an ad on the same browser with the same random identification number can be used to display more products that are relevant.
==========
This technology is sometimes used on the advertiser’s website to recommend other products.
Display Ads Based on Statistical Probabilities
Cerebroad uses data based on thousands of users that respond to ads and products to show the viewer particular products or ads.
This means that actions such as clicking on an ad or visiting an advertiser’s website are anonymously aggregated and used to select the ads to show you and other users.
Therefore, if cookies with similar characteristics to that of a given viewer indicate interest in an advertisement, then it is very likely that this advertisement will appear.
For example, if visitors browsing on an iPad on a Formula 1 site show strong interest in an advertisement for a new iPad subscription to Motor Magazine, then other users on iPads visiting the same Formula 1 site are very likely to be shown that particular advertisement.
Deciding if an Ad Should Be Shown
All the above techniques can be used not only to decide what ad to show, but also whether to show it.
Through real-time-bidding or similar technologies, advertisers can use the above technologies for deciding who it is relevant to display their ads for and not showing it to others.
==========
When using the collected data for advertising purposes, Cerebroad conforms to all applicable laws as well as standards such as edaa for Companies, Self-regulation Framework for Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA) (including in the Mobile Environment), released by IAB Europe, which allows consumers to opt out of behaviour tracking by our technology.
Accordingly, Cerebroad does not target sensitive segments of the audience, such as children under 12 or others considered sensitive by the IAB Europe Self-regulation Framework for OBA.
Data Collection on Behalf of Third Parties
Cerebroad does not allow collection or storage of any type of sensitive personal data including creation or sharing of audience segments that are considered sensitive as classified by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Code of Conduct.
==========
Data that are not sensitive but can be used to identify an individual, such as addresses or telephone numbers, are also not allowed to be collected or stored unless provided voluntarily and explicitly by an individual Internet user.
Any such information is only available for use by the particular advertiser to whom the individual has supplied his or her data.
Advertisers are limited by contract to use these data solely for the purposes, identified in the advertisement, of providing Internet users with requested products, services or information as established in that advertiser’s privacy policy.
==========
Although it is perhaps permitted, Cerebroad does not encourage customers to use its technology for collection or storage of personal identification data.
In all such cases, Cerebroad provides only secure data storage and access to the data control services with no other use of those data.
Cerebroad does not assume responsibility for the advertisers’ use of these voluntarily supplied data.
Cerebroad does not distribute this information to any party other than those indicated in the advertising agreement.
Data Sharing with Third Parties
Cerebroad may share anonymous data collected, or received by partners, in various ways.
==========
Primarily this happens automatically when data is passed to advertising exchanges and similar advertising platforms for buying and optimizing ads.
For instance, Cerebroad may synchronize anonymous identifiers with other ad platforms, customers or websites and services, so that the anonymous data we have collected can be used on third party websites and systems to show more relevant ads and match consumers to their likely interests.
The anonymous data Cerebroad collects or receives may also be processed on our behalf by third-party service providers that assist us in running our business.
Such can be providers of data storage, analytical insights or processing facilities.
==========
For European Union Residents:
For the avoidance of doubt, if Cerebroad should ever transfer data concerning residents of the European Union (EU) to unrelated third parties residing outside the EU it will happen in accordance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield requirements, Cerebroad commits to resolve inquiries about data practices and our collection or use of your personal information.
European Union residents with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy or their data should first contact Cerebroad via email at: or through mail to Cerebroad, Wildersgade 10B, 1408 Copenhagen, Denmark.

The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by Cerebroad.

Ads served by Cerebroad usually link to other web sites, which may have privacy assurance practices that differ from ours.
Cerebroad does not control and cannot be held responsible for the content of these web sites.
To make sure your privacy is protected, please consult the respective privacy policy of the web site you are visiting.
Data Security and Protection

Cerebroad Allows Internet Users to Opt out of:
·       Cookie-based targeted advertisements using Cerebroad technology for online behavioural advertisements (OBAs),
·       Tracking of visits across domains of different media or advertisers’ sites through Cerebroad technology,
·       Any type of cookie-based tracking by third-party technology through Cerebroad.
·       Mobile device-based targeted by changing settings/resetting advertising identifiers on Android and Apple IOS
The opt-out process erases all previously collected data and places an alternative Cerebroad cookie into the Internet user’s browser with special indication of an “opt-out” choice and with no other data.
The cookie applies to the specific computer or mobile device and browser only.
If an Internet user wishes to opt out on other browsers, computers or mobile devices, he or she must repeat the process.
Please also note that if all cookies are erased from the computer or mobile device, the opt-out cookie is also erased and the process must be repeated.
==========
When a user opts out, Cerebroad will no longer:
·       Identify the user by the unique identifier normally stored in the Cerebroad ad-serving cookie.
Users therefore in many cases receive the same ad repeatedly because rotations of ads are based on the unique user identifier,
·       Display personalized ads based on user interests,
·       Collect any data about the user’s interactions with online advertisement and online experience on the web sites,
·       Facilitate similar actions or collection of information for such purposes by other targeting systems used together with Cerebroad.
Opting-Out from advertising and tracking in Apps
Opt-out of ad tracking and targeting on many mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads or Android devices, you should preferably consult your device settings and instructions provided by the device manufacturer.
Below are exemplary information solely for informational purposes for which we disclaim any warranty or representation that the opt-out methods will work or that they are most current.
