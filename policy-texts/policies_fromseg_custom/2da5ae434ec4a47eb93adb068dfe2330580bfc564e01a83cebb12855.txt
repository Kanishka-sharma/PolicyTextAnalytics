Agreement
By clicking through these terms, or signing the Order to which they are attached, you are entering into an agreement with WP Engine to provide Services to you.
That agreement between us is comprised of these Terms of Service, the Order to which they are attached or by which they are referenced, the SLA, AUP, DPA, and Privacy Policy which are referenced herein, and any other terms, exhibits, schedules, or addenda which are referenced by any of the preceding (collectively the “Agreement”).
==========
The Agreement sets forth the exclusive terms and conditions between the Parties and supersedes all previous proposals, agreements, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the Services provided hereunder.
If there is a conflict between the terms of the Agreement, the terms shall govern according to the following order of precedence: 1) the Order, 2) these Terms of Service, and 3) any terms incorporated by reference by either of the above.
The substantive terms contained in your purchase order, order confirmation, notice of receipt, vendor registration portal, or any other transactional document, form, or notice provided by you shall be void and without effect, even where your customary business practices require a showing of assent to such terms by us such as by signature or reference in an invoice.
==========
We may update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion; the current version may be found at https://wpengine.com/legal/terms-of-service/.
In the event of any material change, we will provide you with written notice.
Your continued use of the Services following such updates constitutes your acceptance of the same.
==========
If you do not agree to the terms of any modification, you may terminate the Agreement in accordance with the Termination section below.
Services
We will provide the Services in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the SLA.
==========
You acknowledge that we may engage third parties to provide or enable elements of the Services, provided that we are responsible to you for the performance of such third parties as if we performed the Services ourselves.
You shall use the Services solely for the intended purpose in accordance with the Agreement, including the AUP, and provide us with all information, assistance, and materials reasonably required for our ongoing provision of the Services.
==========
We will provide support to you through the standard means we make available to our customers (e.g. knowledgebase, forums, chat, ticket).
Authorized Users seeking support must have a basic understanding of the systems and technology related to the Services.
The scope of Services provided under the Agreement may be amended by any reasonable means showing mutual agreement between the Parties including click-through terms, email, support ticket, or your selections in the User Portal.
==========
Any associated fees will be clearly and conspicuously provided to you before you agree to any such change.
From time to time, we may provide replacements for certain components of the Services or cease supporting them altogether.
==========
No such replacement or end of life shall constitute a breach of the Agreement.
If you request or utilize any Beta Services, such Beta Services shall be provided on an AS-IS basis with all faults.
No SLA, indemnity, representation, or warranty shall apply to Beta Services.
We reserve the right to terminate the Beta Services at any time and make no representation that Beta Services will be released into production.
==========
Authorized Users
You may designate a number of Authorized Users in the User Portal for the purpose of receiving support and making changes to your account.
You are responsible for managing your Authorized Users and keeping them up-to-date.
You authorize us to provide all applicable support and account information to your Authorized Users and to make modifications to the Services at their direction.
You may only add, modify, or remove Authorized Users through the User Portal.
We will not do so on your behalf, and we will only provide support, assistance, and information to your Authorized Users who can verify their identity through the User Portal.
==========
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you pay for the Services with a credit or debit card, we may remove that card as a payment method at the request of any individual who is able to provide reasonably satisfactory evidence that he or she is the named individual on such credit or debit card.
You will require your Authorized Users to abide by the terms of the Agreement, and you acknowledge and agree that you are fully responsible for the actions and omissions of your Authorized Users and for all costs, overages, or other liabilities incurred through your account except to the sole extent that any such use or liability is the result of our breach of the Agreement.
An Authorized User, within the scope of permissions granted to such user in the User Portal, may make changes to the Services, and you agree to pay any Fees associated with such changes.
You shall promptly notify us in the event that you become aware of any violation of the terms of the Agreement or any unauthorized use of the accounts of you or your Authorized Users.
==========
Fees; Invoicing
You agree to pay the Fees beginning on the Effective Date and according to the payment terms set out in the Order.
If no payment terms are specified, Fees shall be due in full in advance, except for usage or overage fees which are invoiced monthly in arrears.
If the Order sets any limit on your use of Services (such as number of visitors) and that limit is exceeded, you will be responsible for the applicable overages.
You agree to pay any applicable taxes (excluding taxes on our income) which we are required to collect unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate.
==========
If you elect to make any payment via wire or credit transfer, then you are responsible for any applicable transfer fees.
Any applicable overages, taxes, or transfer fees will be added to the Fees.
Fees applicable to any Renewal Term will be at our then-current rates, provided that we have notified you of any applicable increase prior to the date by which you may opt out of the renewal.
Fees are payable in the currency specified in the Order and are not refundable except as expressly stated herein.

If you elect to pay via credit or debit card, we will charge the provided credit or debit card immediately upon account activation and on each renewal date thereafter, up to one week prior to the due date.
If you elect to pay by any other method, payments are due 30 days from your receipt of the applicable invoice.
==========
It is your responsibility to maintain accurate and up-to-date billing details and ensure the Fees are paid by the due date.
If you fail to maintain accurate and up-to-date billing details, your account may be suspended until such details are provided.
==========
If you are overdue on any Fees, we may: (i) charge a late fee on the unpaid balance at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum lawful rate permitted by applicable law, (ii) suspend provision of the Services, and (iii) terminate the Agreement in accordance with Section 5(b) below.
You will be responsible for any charges associated with our collection efforts related to unpaid Fees.
==========
Term; Termination
In order to prevent any unintended Service interruptions, this Agreement will automatically renew, but you may still terminate the Agreement at any time in accordance with Section 5(b).
The Agreement will renew for successive Renewal Terms each equal to the immediately preceding term unless a Party provides notification of its intent not to renew no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.
You may terminate your account and this Agreement at any time via the User Portal: (i) if we materially breach the Agreement and fail to cure such breach within 10 days of your notice to us; (ii) for convenience, if you provide us with at least 30 days notice; or (iii) for any other cause stated herein.
Upon termination, we will provide you with a prorated refund of any unused Fees paid annually in advance for Services beyond the date of termination (adjusted for any discounts that are rendered void due to such termination and any other amounts which you owe).
We may terminate the Agreement prior to the end of the Term: (i) if you materially breach the Agreement and fail to cure such breach within 10 days of our notice to you; (ii) if we reasonably believe that your use of the Services endangers or negatively affects our network or systems, violates the law, or interferes with our ability to provide services to our other customers; (iii) if you abuse, harass, or threaten any of our employees; (iv) for convenience if we provide you with at least 30 days notice; or (v) for any other cause stated herein.
If we terminate for convenience, we will provide you with a prorated refund of any unused Fees paid annually in advance for Services beyond the date of termination and adjusted for any amounts which you may owe.
Once your account has been terminated, you will no longer be able to receive support or access the User Portal, and we will not be able to assist you with any site migration tasks.

We and our licensors own and shall continue to own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services and the systems and networks used to provide such Services, including all system-generated data (e.g. performance data), modifications, improvements, upgrades, derivative works, and all intellectual property rights in and to any of the foregoing.

==========
Confidentiality.
Each Party agrees to preserve the confidential nature of the other Party’s Confidential Information by retaining and using the Confidential Information in trust and confidence, solely for its use as permitted and in connection with the Agreement, and by using the same degree of protection that it uses to protect its own similar confidential information, which in no event shall be less than reasonable care.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to the limited extent such disclosure is required by law, legal process, or court order, including any requirement under applicable data privacy regulations that a notice of data breach be given to a supervisory authority or regulatory agency.
Information disclosed for these reasons will not cease to be Confidential Information.
To the extent practicable, a Party will provide prompt notice of any such required disclosure and shall cooperate with all reasonable efforts by the disclosing Party to minimize or exclude the Confidential Information from such disclosure.
Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement for any reason, any license granted herein to use the Confidential Information shall terminate immediately, and each Party will either return or destroy any Confidential Information in its possession which belongs to the other Party, or it shall continue to protect the Confidential Information in accordance with the Agreement for as long as it is retained as part of that Party’s customary business practices.
Notwithstanding any other terms to the contrary herein, each Party will have the right to seek an injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent a breach or threatened breach of this Section.

Should we determine that our network has been accessed in an unauthorized manner, and that unauthorized access impacts your Services, we agree to notify you as soon as reasonably practicable after we have investigated the unauthorized access and fulfilled our legal obligations.
Likewise, you agree to notify us should you identify unauthorized access to the Services.

Limitations
Although we may perform regular backups of your site and Customer Content (as described in the Order), we do not guarantee there will be no loss or corruption of data.
Corrupt or invalid backup points may be caused by, among other things, content that is corrupted prior to being backed up or that changes during the time a backup is performed.
We will provide support to you and attempt to troubleshoot any known or discovered issues that may affect your backups, but you acknowledge that we have no liability related to the integrity of your backups or the failure to successfully restore your content to a usable state.
