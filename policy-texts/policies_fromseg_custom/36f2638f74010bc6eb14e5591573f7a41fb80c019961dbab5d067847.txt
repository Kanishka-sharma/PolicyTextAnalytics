HubSpot Indemnification
We will indemnify, defend and hold you harmless, at our expense, against any Action brought against you (and your officers, directors, employees, agents, service providers, licensors, and Affiliates) by a third party not affiliated with you to the extent that such Action is based upon or arises out of (1) an allegation that the Subscription Service infringes a valid patent in a member state of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, registered trademark, or registered copyright (“IP Indemnification”), or (2) our breach of our confidentiality obligations or our use of Customer Data in violation of this Agreement (“Confidentiality and Data Misuse Indemnification”).
You will: notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of you becoming aware of any such claim; give us sole control of the defense or settlement of such a claim; and provide us (at our expense) with any and all information and assistance reasonably requested by us to handle the defense or settlement of the claim.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of such a claim, or if we believe that such a claim is likely, we may, at our sole option and expense: (a) modify the Subscription Service or provide you with substitute Subscription Service that is non-infringing; or (b) obtain a license or permission for you to continue to use the Subscription Service, at no additional cost to you; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is, in our judgment, commercially practicable, terminate your access to the Subscription Service (or to a portion of the Subscription Service as necessary to resolve the claimed infringement) and refund any prepaid but unused fees covering use of the Subscription Service after termination.
