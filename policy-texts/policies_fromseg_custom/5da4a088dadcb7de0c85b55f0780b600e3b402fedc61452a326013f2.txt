Only the cookies associated with Raven identify you personally, when you request authentication; other cookies used on this site do not collect personal information.
Raven Authentication
This site uses the University's Raven authentication service if it needs to identify you to give you access to restricted content.
This may lead to two cookies being set:

It manages your authentication to this site.
If you reject this cookie you will not be able to access restricted content on this site.
The other is set by and returned to the server at raven.cam.ac.uk.

This is used to implement Raven's 'single sign-on' function and allows Raven to identify you to other web sites without you having to re-enter your Raven password.
