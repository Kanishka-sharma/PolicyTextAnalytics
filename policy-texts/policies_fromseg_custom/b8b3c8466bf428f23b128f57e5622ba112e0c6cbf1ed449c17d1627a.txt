WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information You Provide Us Through Your Correspondence on this Website
It is extremely rare that we collect personal information.
However, in the instance we do, the personal information we collect comes directly from our Site visitors.
We collect personal information from our visitors in the following situations:
When you submit inquiries through our “contact us” link on this website,
When a visitor signs up to receive our marketing emails or newsletters,
To submit information in connection with an employment inquiry,
When a visitor expressly enters information into a text field or otherwise submits information to us.
We keep a record of the information you provide including your email address and any other Personally Identifying Information, (“PII”), you provide, solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or request.
PII includes name, address, telephone number, email address, or any other data used or intended to be used to contact specific person.
==========
We automatically receive Non-Personal Information (“Non-PII”) when you visit our Site.
Non-PII is any information where on its own cannot be used to identify, contact, or precisely locate a particular individual.
==========
Non-PII includes  your IP address (in the US), browser information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, the date and time of your visit, and the web page you have visited immediately prior to visiting this Site, and more.
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, this information will never be shared with third parties without your consent.
==========
GroupM may pass your PII to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies so that they may contact you in connection with your inquiry.
PII passed on to a subsidiary or affiliate of GroupM in another country will receive protections in accordance with GroupM policies and local law.
==========
By using our Site you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules and regulations than in your country.
GroupM may provide you with the ability to purchase or subscribe to certain services on the GroupM website for a fee.
In such event, we will collect certain PII from you, including payment information, solely for the purpose of processing your purchase or subscription.
In connection with such purchase or subscription, we may share your PII and payment information with our affiliates or vendors to the extent necessary to process your payment and deliver to you the products or services you have purchased.

Information We Collect Through our Services
We do not collect PII from users online through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients unless, in the rare instance, users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in a text field for example.
We do collect Non-PII to identify devices that we have interacted with before through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.
For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a device that has previously seen an advertisement we launched on behalf of a client.
Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an internet connection.
==========
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
Use of information for Services
As stated above, we may collect Non-PII regarding your web browsing, usage or interactions with advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.
Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements across numerous websites and to prevent excessive or repeated deliveries of the same advertisements.
We do this to better customize the sort of advertisements you see on various websites and for other purposes such as research and analysis.
For example, if we infer that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver interest-based online advertisements to you about a particular type of apparel.
You can learn more about such advertising practices by visiting www.iab.net/privacymatters.
==========
Disclosures for Europe
Please note – in Europe, an IP address is considered PII by applicable law.
If we conduct business in such countries and we know that you are located in such a country, we will treat your IP address as PII.
In such countries we interpose a “black box” which is operated by an independent third party and which separates the user’s IP address from other data we collect.
