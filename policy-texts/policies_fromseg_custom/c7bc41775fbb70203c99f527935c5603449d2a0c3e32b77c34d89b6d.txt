Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), California "Consumers" have the right to opt out of the "sale" of their "Personal Information" (the words in quotation marks are defined in CCPA).
To exercise your other rights under CCPA, please complete this request form.
For more information about U.S. News's privacy practices for California Consumers, please see our Privacy Policy and our California Privacy Notice.
California Consumers who wish to opt out of the sale of their Personal Information may select one or more of these options:
*There is not yet an industry consensus as to whether data practices related to third party cookies and tracking devices associated with the U.S. News Services constitute a “sale” of your Personal Information as defined by CCPA.
U.S. News has adopted certain technology solutions for exercising “do not sell” requests that have been developed by the Interactive Advertising Bureau or individual companies, assuming that certain exchanges of data from cookies and tracking devices are classified as a “sale” of personal information under CCPA.
==========
However, not all of the third parties that provide features of, or interest-based advertising on, the U.S. News Services are currently participating in such technology solutions.
To the extent that a third party does not participate in such technology solutions, U.S. News is unable to communicate to them any “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” instruction from you.
==========
Some third parties that may collect Personal Information in association with your use of our online services for advertising, analytics and other purposes, and that may “sell” (as defined by CCPA) that Personal Information downstream, provide you the opportunity to opt-out of their sales.
Please visit here to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information by participating third parties.
You must opt out on every device and browser you use in order to effectuate your “Do Not Sell” requests from these parties.
==========
However, opting out does not mean you will stop seeing ads and you may continue to still see interest-based ads.
To learn more about interest-based advertising and additional opt-out choices related to it, please visit Your AdChoices and NAI Consumer Opt Out.
