Quizlet uses cookies and related technologies to provide you with a fast, safe, and personalized experience on its site.
Cookies also help us understand how certain features are being used, and allow us to improve Quizlet for all users.
Below we explain more about what cookies are, how we and our third party partners use them, and how you can control their usage.
By accessing and using our site without disabling cookies on your device or opting out of third-party cookies, you consent to our use of these cookies and the information we collect with them.
If you do not consent, please disable or block cookies in your browser using the methods described below under “How to Control Cookies,” and the opt-out links provided in the “Cookies Set by Third Parties” section.
For more detailed information about what data we collect from our users, please read our Privacy Policy.
==========
Cookies are small text files that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit that website.
These cookies enable the website to remember your actions and preferences for a period of time, so that you don’t have to re-enter them each time you come back to the website or browse from one page to another.
Like many websites, Quizlet uses cookies to deliver, measure, and improve its platform in several different ways.
We always use secure cookies, which means the data contained in them can only ever be transmitted over an encrypted connection.
Our general categories of use are outlined below.
Please note that cookies set by Quizlet can have many different names, but can always be distinguished from third party cookies in that they always start with a letter or number and never an underscore (_).
For some features of the website, it’s necessary to store data temporarily on one page so that we can use it again on another.
==========
For example, if you are referred by another user to Quizlet, a referral code is stored in a cookie so that, if you chose to upgrade, we can credit that other user with the referral.
User Input cookies are persistent cookies with durations of anywhere from several days to several years.
User Input cookies can be opted out of using the directions in the “How to Control Cookies” section; however, doing so may break certain functionality on Quizlet.
We use cookies as a prevention measure to keep malicious actors from being able to take control of your Quizlet account and perform actions on it without your knowledge or consent.

Many features of the website will store your preferences about how that feature is displayed or used in a cookie.
For example, if you study a Quizlet study set in Test Mode, your preferences about how many and what kinds of questions appear in the test are stored in a cookie.
Cookies that store preferences can be set with durations anywhere from just the current session up to a year.
Preferences cookies can be opted out of using the directions in the “How to Control Cookies” section; however, doing so will break all functionality which relies on them for storing preferences.
In order to understand how users interact with specific features of Quizlet and to further improve our website, we sometimes collect anonymous data about website usage and store it in cookies.
We also set a cookie containing a unique, random value so that we can anonymously identify you each time you come to the website.
