What information do we collect from our users?
ScientificAmerican.com collects personally identifying information from our users during (1) online registration, (2) contest or sweepstakes registration, (3) online surveys, (4) online purchasing, and (5) questions posted to our experts.
Generally, this information includes name, e-mail address, postal address, and answers to survey questions.
The information is used for internal marketing purposes and helps us determine how to continually improve our site.
We contact only those individuals who specifically request that we do so and those who have won a contest or sweepstakes.

Resumes

ScientificAmerican.com Jobs gives you the option of putting your resume in our database.
There are two ways of doing this:


You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers.
Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product.
If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all employers and recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product will have access to your resume.
==========
We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to this database.
You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
However, employers and recruiters who have paid for access to the database, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the database.
Updating Account Information

ScientificAmerican.com Jobs allows you to change or correct your personal information at any time.
To do so, simply log into your personal account, go to your account profile, and you will find options for editing the information you have submitted.

What are cookies and how are they used?
Cookies help track a person's "session" while online.
They are used on our site to gather basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements.
==========
They are especially necessary when ordering a product online.
Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.
In some instances, advertisers will set cookies on our site.
These cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information that we have collected but are for monitoring and tracking ad impressions.
==========
Many browsers are set to accept cookies.
You may prefer to set your browser to refuse cookies.
It is possible, however, that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so.
==========
This is especially likely when trying to order a product online.
Our servers collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site.
(Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.)
Your IP address does not identify you personally.
We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site.
==========
Are all Privacy Policies the same?
ScientificAmerican.com includes links to other web sites whose Privacy Policies we do not control.
Once you leave ScientificAmerican.com, use of any information you provide is governed by the operator of the site you are visiting.
That policy may differ from ours.
If you can't find the Privacy Policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.
==========
Our Pledge:
We will never sell, exchange, or release your personal information (name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card data, etc.) without your consent, regardless of its source, to any third parties.
When we do give information to our advertisers, it is in the form of grouped statistics compiled from registration data and participants' answers to survey questions.
None of the data provided is personally identifiable.
Information gathered through the use of cookies is not related to any personally identifiable details.
All information gathered on ScientificAmerican.com is securely stored within a controlled database.
The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.
==========
However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
And, of course, any information you include in a question you post to the Ask the Experts area is available to anyone with Internet access.
