How do you use information to target ads and content?
AOL uses information to operate and improve our services, fulfill your requests, and communicate with you, conduct research, and personalize content and ads provided to you.
Often, an ad you see online is customized based on the content of the site.
For example, you may see sports-related ads on a sports site.
We may also select an ad based on our knowledge of the audience we think may be looking at that page.
This is often done with publicly available and/or aggregated demographic information, or it may be done with analysis of the aggregated traffic on a particular website, or by using the registration data or other household data you have provided or that we have acquired from other companies.

==========
In addition to customizing advertisements for you based on the subject matter of the page you are visiting, demographic data, or information you have already provided to AOL, some ads may be targeted based on your activity on sites in the AOL Advertising Network.
When you visit these sites, you may receive a "cookie" that helps us note, in an anonymized way, that your browser visited that site.
AOL Advertising may use information about your activity on the AOL Advertising Network to display ads that are more relevant.
Note that the information shared with the advertising network is always with a unique identifier, not personally identifiable information, such as your name or email address.
Our AdVisibility Profile Viewer allows you to see how the information we collect about your visits within the AOL Advertising Network are categorized into the interest segments used to select the ads displayed.
==========
You can also opt out of targeted ads.
Please note that you will still receive ads; however, they will no longer be tailored based on your activities.

How do the AOL brands respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals?
How do the AOL brands respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals?
Some web browsers may transmit "Do Not Track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates.
Currently, there is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals and AOL currently does not take action in response to these signals.
==========
Previously, Gravity provided users with the ability to use the browser "Do Not Track" signal to opt out of certain personalization.
AOL has consolidated and simplified many of the preferences and opt-outs we offer, and as a result, "Do Not Track" browser signals will no longer be recognized.
==========
You can still opt-out of Gravity personalization using the cookie-based opt-out available on the Gravity website and this opt-out is also now part of the AOL Advertising opt-out available on various industry opt-out pages, such as The Network Advertising Initiative and The Digital Advertising Alliance.
Effective September 15, 2014, Gravity will only disable personalization in response to these opt-out cookies.
==========
If and when a standard for responding to browser "Do Not Track" signals is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.
