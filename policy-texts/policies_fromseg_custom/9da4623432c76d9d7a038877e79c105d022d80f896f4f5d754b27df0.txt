The security of Member information 
                              is crucial to our success in the highly competitive 
                              field of online advertising.
Fastclick may, from 
                              time to time, use "gallery" pages to identify 
                              Publishers and Advertisers by business identity 
                              ONLY (e.g. Adcycle.com is a new Member of the Fastclick 
                              Network).

                                Files
We 
                                record the IP address of new Members at sign-up.
This can assist in administering the website and 
                                Member accounts, including the possible implementation 
                                of "fast-login" and "my Fastclick" 
                                features designed to enhance the Member experience.

                                the privacy practices of such other websites.
We encourage our users to be aware when they leave 
                                our website and to read the privacy statements 
                                of each and every website that collects personally 
                                identifiable information.
This privacy statement 
                                applies solely to information collected by this 
                                website.
Security
This 
                                website takes every precaution to protect Member 
                                information against loss, misuse or alteration.
==========
Access to personally identifiable information 
                                is password protected and restricted within our 
                                organization on a need-to-know basis.
Every 
                                page that involves a form which my contain Member 
                                personally identifiable information (such as name, 
                                password, address, credit card number and social 
                                security number) is encrypted and transferred 
                                from the browser to our web server using SSL (https).
This means that while on a secure page, such as 
                                our login page or our campaign order form, the 
                                lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as 
                                Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
                                becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, 
                                when you are just 'surfing'.
==========
While 
                                we use encryption to protect sensitive information 
                                online, we also do everything in our power to 
                                protect Member information off-line.
All of our 
                                Member information, not just the sensitive information 
                                mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform 
                                a specific job (for example, our billing clerk 
                                or a customer service representative) are granted 
                                access to personally identifiable information.
==========
ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security 
                                and privacy practices.
Every quarter, as well 
                                as any time new policies are added, our employees 
                                are notified and/or reminded about the importance 
                                we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure 
                                our customers' information is protected.
Finally, 
                                the servers that we store personally identifiable 
                                information on are kept in a secure environment, 
                                in locked enclosures, in a restricted access, 
                                locked server room.
