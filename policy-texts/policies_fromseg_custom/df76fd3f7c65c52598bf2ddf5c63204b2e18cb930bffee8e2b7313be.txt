McKinsey & Company, Inc.
United States and its United States affiliates (collectively, “McKinsey”) respect your concerns about privacy.
McKinsey complies with laws and regulations pertaining to data privacy and data protection applicable to McKinsey in its role as a data processor.
In particular, when McKinsey transfers any Personal Information (as described below) from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland to McKinsey in the United States, McKinsey complies with the data privacy principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, enforcement and oversight as applicable to such personal information and as described in this privacy statement (the “Privacy Statement”).
As a further demonstration of its commitment to data privacy and protection, McKinsey has self-certified certain of its client service solutions to the privacy principles set forth in the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework.
While McKinsey is aware of and abides by the recent decision of the European Court of Justice regarding the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework, McKinsey also believes that the Safe Harbor principles continue to represent an important declaration of the seriousness with which McKinsey takes the privacy and security of the Personal Information subject to this Privacy Statement.
Accordingly, McKinsey will continue to abide by the Safe Harbor principles with respect to such Personal Information, in addition to any agreements governing the use of Personal Information.

Onward Transfer
We use third party service providers to support the Solutions and/or specific Studies.
