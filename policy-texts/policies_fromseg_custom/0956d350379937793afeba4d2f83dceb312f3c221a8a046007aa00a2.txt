If a test sponsor offers their test outside of a Pearson VUE authorized testing center through remote proctoring and if you choose to take the test through Pearson VUE’s remote proctoring function, you will be monitored over the Internet through your computer via your webcam and microphone.
Remote proctoring means that you will log on to a platform through the internet to take you test and during your entire remote proctored testing session you will be video and audio recorded, whereby, anything in which your camera can view, including but not limited your face, desk workspace, and your environment, and any sounds that can be detected by your microphone will be or may be recorded in real time for the sole use and purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and your test sponsor’s privacy policy, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.
You need to make sure you review your sponsor’s privacy policy.

If at any time during a remote proctored testing session a third party enters the work space or if any third party’s voice is detected on the audio recording your testing session will be immediately terminated and the test stopped.
==========
If this event occurs you will not receive a test refund or be credited for any portion of the test fee.
It is your responsibility to manage your remote proctoring environment.
The video and audio recordings are standard test procedures for all test sponsors’ remote proctored tests and your video and audio recording will be used for purposes of identity verification, remote observation, incident resolution, such as fraud prevention, test security, and for the integrity of the test and testing process.
Personal Information Collected for Remote Proctoring Test Services
All of the same personal information that we collect or receive as described above applies to you when you register to take a test sponsor’s remote proctored test.

The collection of such data is optional, but necessary if you choose to use the remote proctoring function.
You understand that the audio- and video-tapes of your testing session will be supplied to the relevant test sponsor and any of their appointed agents to assist with their management of your test.
