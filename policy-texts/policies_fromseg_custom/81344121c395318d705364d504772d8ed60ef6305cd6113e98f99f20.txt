Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of text sent as files to your computer or mobile device when you visit most websites.
Cookies may be delivered by us (first party cookies) or delivered by a third-party partner or supplier (third-party cookies).
Cookies are either session cookies or persistent cookies.
Session cookies enable sites to recognize and link the actions of a user during a browsing session and expire at the end of each session.
Persistent cookies help us recognize you as an existing user and these cookies are stored on your system or device until they expire, although you can delete them before the expiration date.

Other similar technologies
Web beacons, gifs, and clear gifs are tiny graphics, each with a unique identifier that are embedded invisibly on sites and in emails.
Web beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited or if ad banners on our sites and other sites are effective.
We also use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know whether our emails have been opened by recipients, which helps us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications, promotions, and marketing campaigns.
Proximity based beacons send one-way signals over very short distances, to communicate with associated mobile apps installed on your phone.
They can notify you, for example, about experiences related to your trip and can alert you to related deals or promotions.
Beacons communicate with your device only when you are in close proximity and only if you have given consent within the relevant mobile application.

We use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, facilitate the log-in process, monitor the activity on our sites, and deliver online advertising.
Tags are small pieces of HTML code that tell your browser to request certain content generated by an ad server.
We use tags to show you relevant advertising and promotions.
Scripts are pieces of JavaScript code that launch automatically when certain webpages load, to determine whether users view associated advertisements.
Local Storage Objects, such as HTML 5, are used to store content and preferences.
Third-parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use Local Storage Objects to collect and store information.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to sites with which the browser communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether users are even aware of them.
Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, sites should do when they receive such signals.
==========
We currently do not take action in response to these signals.
If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess our sites’ responses to these signals and make appropriate updates to this Cookie Statement.

If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, please contact us via the Privacy Section on our Customer Services Portal here.
