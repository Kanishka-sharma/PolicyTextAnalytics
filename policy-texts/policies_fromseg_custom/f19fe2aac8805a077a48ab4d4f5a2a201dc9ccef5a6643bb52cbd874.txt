Each of these service providers is contractually obligated to provide services to us in a manner consistent with this Statement.
Third party privacy practices: Our Web sites may contain links to other Web sites, such as those of our customers and partners.
FreeWheel is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
Public Fora
We may at times offer you the option to post content to a blog, message board, or chat room.
==========
In the course of doing so, you may provide information that can identify you personally.
You should be aware that any visitor may view your postings on a blog, on a message board, or in a chat room.
Furthermore, any information that you post, including your profile information, is available to all users of that blog, message board, or chat room, and thus is neither private nor confidential.
We cannot guarantee the security of such information that is disclosed or communicated online in these public areas, and you do so at your own risk.
We reserve the right at any time, in our sole discretion, to remove any content that you may post on any blog, message board, or chat room and/or restrict your access to any blog, message board, or chat room.
We further reserve the right to republish any user postings from blogs, message boards, or chat rooms elsewhere on the Internet in any format.
To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us as provided below.
In some cases we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
==========
Your interactions with the user community programs we have with third party social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter may be displayed on this Web site and used by us in a manner consistent with this Statement.
Your interactions may also be displayed in your social networking profile.
These interactions may be viewable by anyone that has access to that profile, depending on your privacy settings with the social networking site.
You should review the privacy policies of these social networking sites to understand who may have access to your interactions and how the site may use them.
FreeWheel’s Provision of Services to Customers
FreeWheel is an application services provider, meaning that we host a software application that our customers access via the worldwide Web.
==========
We have no direct business relationship with the end users of our customers.
Each customer understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive information from the Web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such customer’s Web property or viewing content that is owned or displayed by such customer.
This information includes frequency of ads delivered, time, browser type and version, visitor’s operating system, and visitors’ IP addresses and cookie data, including User IDs.
FreeWheel requires its customers to obtain consent for the use of such information by FreeWheel and FreeWheel uses it for its provision of Services and enforcement of its rights as described in the applicable customer contract, to improve its Services, and to compile aggregated statistics for internal or marketing purposes.
The visitor information that FreeWheel collects, stores, and uses on its customers’ behalf is not intended to identify individual persons and FreeWheel does not possess or have access to information that could match IP addresses or User IDs to the identity of individuals.
==========
FreeWheel does not allow visitor information collected and stored for one customer to be accessed by any other FreeWheel customer.
Further, FreeWheel may use and retain such information only as provided in its agreement with its customer.
We do, however, reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.
==========
None of the above principles changed following FreeWheel’s acquisition by Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast”).
All of FreeWheel’s contractual obligations with respect to each customer’s information have remained and will remain intact.
Also, post-acquisition, FreeWheel will continue to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comcast, meaning the two companies will be separate legal entities.
As such, FreeWheel cannot per the terms of its agreement with each customer allow Comcast (or any of Comcast’s other affiliates) to access FreeWheel customer data for any purpose.
Maintaining FreeWheel’s status as a trusted partner is critical to the continued success of our business.
Comcast and FreeWheel have been careful to structure the acquisition so as not to disrupt that trust.
==========
We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services.
We ask each customer to post a privacy policy that covers our Services and to maintain all necessary rights to allow us to provide the Services, including without limitation to receive the information that we collect and store on such customer’s behalf.
We also require each customer to permit no personally identifiable information to be sent to us.
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the customer of FreeWheel (the data controller) which has transferred such data to FreeWheel for processing.
==========
Tracking Technologies and End User Opt-Out
Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that are designed to store basic information.
FreeWheel uses a cookie in connection with its provision of Services.
This cookie does not store any personally-identifiable information and is not otherwise used to provide your identity; it merely is used to recognize your browser.
==========
FreeWheel’s cookie is not specific to any of FreeWheel’s individual customers.
Accordingly, if you choose to opt-out of FreeWheel’s cookie for any FreeWheel customer, you will be opted out for all of the Web sites and customers that use FreeWheel’s Services.

If you select a FreeWheel opt-out cookie, ads delivered to your browser on behalf of customers using FreeWheel’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information that is automatically transmitted in the Internet environment when an ad request is received by FreeWheel’s ad servers.
In such case, your FreeWheel cookie will not be uniquely identified.
The non-personally identifiable information that is automatically transmitted includes your browser type, Internet service provider, information about the general content of the site or page displayed on your browser, and other non-personally identifiable information provided by the Web site or customer.
==========
When you receive this cookie, FreeWheel’s systems will know that you have opted out and will not attempt to assign other FreeWheel cookies in the future.
Since the FreeWheel opt-out cookie does not contain a unique user number, it does not allow your browser to be identified uniquely.
PLEASE NOTE: If you erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), or use a new or different computer, you may need to opt out again.
In order to provide our Services in connection with mobile applications, we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies.

FreeWheel adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-regulatory Principles of Online Behavioral Advertising <http://www.aboutads.info/principles>.
Companies that engage in Online Behavioral Advertising (also called Interest-based Advertising) use information gathered about your visits over time and across different Web sites or applications in order to predict your preferences and show you ads that are more likely to be of interest to you.
While FreeWheel itself does not engage in Online Behavioral Advertising, certain of FreeWheel’s Services enable our customers to use audience data to enhance their targeting of ads.
For these reasons, we have elected to participate in the DAA’s Consumer Choice Page <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> in order to offer you the ability to elect not to receive such targeted advertising from our customers.
==========
Additional tracking technologies such as beacons, tags, and scripts may be used on FreeWheel’s Web sites by FreeWheel and our analytics service provider.
These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Web site, tracking users’ movements around the site, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
==========

Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Web site.
Your interactions with each these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.
Security & Data Retention
We maintain security measures with the view to protecting against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any information that is under our control.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
While we are committed to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, please be advised that FreeWheel assumes no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your information (personal or otherwise) due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond FreeWheel’s control.
==========
We will retain any personally identifiable information you have provided to us for as long as we believe is necessary to provide you the information you requested or as reasonably useful for commercial purposes.
We retain IP addresses that we have collected on behalf of our customers for a period of 4 weeks from the date of our receipt.
Changes in our business or privacy policies
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain of our assets.
In such transactions, visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.

Such a transaction will be disclosed per the guidelines below.
==========
