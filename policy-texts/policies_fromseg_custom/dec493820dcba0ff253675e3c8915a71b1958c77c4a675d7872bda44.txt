Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements
This Site may display ads from other companies.
We also partner with vendors to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated sites or apps.
Some of the ads on this Site or on other sites or apps may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your device’s browsing activity.
For example, anonymous information collected by our ad networks or other vendors across multiple sites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.
We may share your information with our service providers to permit them to recognize and serve targeted ads to you across the different devices you use.
Before we share your information, we transform, or “hash”, it so that it is not in personally identifiable form.
==========
Our vendors, including Facebook and Google, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information about your internet usage, including your use of this Site, and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads.
We and our vendors may use first-party cookies or other first-party identifiers as well as cookies or other identifiers operated by our vendors to deliver advertisements, create a profile of you, measure your interests, detect your demographics, detect your location, and personalize content.

Your CCPA Rights
Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information
We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a Sale under the CCPA: (i) if you direct us to share PI; (ii) to comply with your requests under the CCPA; (iii) disclosures as part of a merger or asset sale; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
We do not believe that cookies operated by our vendors that facilitate online advertising or other activities in connection with our online services, which themselves Collect and share PI, are a sale by us of your PI under the CCPA.
However, we provide Consumers who use our online services a way to manage their cookie preferences based on categories of cookies through our management tool available here [link to open OneTrust controls].
You will need to do this on each browser that you use to access our Site, and clearing cookies on your browser(s) may disable your preference settings.
==========
In addition, some third-party cookie operators that Collect PI in connection with our online services for advertising, analytics and other purposes offer you the ability to opt-out of their own downstream Sales.
Please visit here to opt-out of the Sale of PI by these third parties.
This is a third-party program and we are not responsible for its effectiveness.
You must opt-out on every Device and browser you use in order to effectuate your requests to opt-out of the Sale of PI by these parties.
==========
For more information on how to exercise choices regarding cookies and interest-based advertising, see the section above titled "Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements" [hyperlink to above section titled "Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements"].
Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do-not-track signals, but like many website operators, we currently do not understand them to operate in that manner or to signify a request to opt-out of the Sale of your PI.
We understand that various parties are developing signals to communicate such requests, and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.
Rights to Know and Delete Personal Information
California Consumers have the right to exercise certain privacy rights under the CCPA.
==========
Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process.
We will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we Collected PI.
If you are unable to provide us with certain information about yourself or, in some cases, about your transaction history with us, we will be unable to verify your identity to fulfill a request to know or delete.
As an initial matter, we require you to provide your name, address, email address, and phone number to be submitted via our online request form or toll-free telephone number below.
In some cases, we may verify identity by confirming that you are the owner of the email address we have on file.
==========
For your specific pieces of information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply heightened verification standards, and reserve the right to request further information from you, in addition to the information mentioned above.
Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with a Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s PI (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a Pseudonymous browser ID).
As required by the CCPA, we do not include that PI in response to verifiable Consumer requests.
If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Collect, Process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.
==========
We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
You may use an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA to submit a consumer rights request.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require proof that the agent has been authorized by you to do so, and take other steps permissible under the CCPA, to ensure it is a proper request by an authorized agent.

Specific Pieces
You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have Collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.
Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request.
b.
==========
The Right to Deletion
You may request that we delete your PI that we have Collected directly from you and are maintaining.
Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not Collect directly from you.
Exceptions do apply, including, without limitation, where we need to retain your PI for regulatory reasons, to complete a warranty or other contract with you, or other internal uses of the information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
To exercise the right to know or right to delete, you may submit a request by calling us at 888-527-6415 or online at https://transformco.com/privacy/request.
In order to complete your request, you will be required to respond to any follow up inquires we may make, and we may deny your request if you do not do so.
==========
Transformco will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising these rights.
Notice of Financial Incentive and Non-Discrimination
This Financial Incentives and Non-Discrimination Disclosure applies to loyalty and rewards programs run by Transformco.
Currently we operate the Shop Your Way Program (“Shop Your Way” or the “Program”).
==========
A separate notice for it follows below.
We may add or change programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions, so check them regularly.
==========
We will not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the rights provided by the CCPA.
You can opt-out of non-Program marketing emails or delete your PI from our active marketing lists and retain your Program account and benefits.
==========
Participating in Shop Your Way is entirely optional but is subject to additional Shop Your Way Program Terms and Conditions.
We treat the value of Consumer data Collected through the Program as the equivalent of relevant expenses related to the Collection and retention of Consumers’ PI as part of the Program.
We value the benefits of the Shop Your Way Program as the value of rewards given to members, which are outlined in the Shop Your Way Program Terms and Conditions.
We pay these expenses and provide the Program benefits, which vary depending upon Program participation, to foster a positive relationship with our members that is invaluable.
==========
California Consumers may make a PI deletion request under the CCPA by calling us at 888-527-6415 or online at https://transformco.com/privacy/request.
If this request includes deleting your email address, then it will terminate your Program membership because that information is necessary for us to provide the Program.
Upon a termination request, some Program data associated with the terminated account may be retained for record keeping, tax reporting, and other legally permissible purposes.
==========
California Shine the Light Law
California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
Separate from your CCPA opt-out rights, you have additional rights regarding disclosure of your information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident, you may request information about our compliance with Shine the Light by contacting us at dataprivacy@transformco.com or by sending a letter to
Transform SR Holding Management LLC
ATTN: Legal Intake/Privacy
3333 Beverly Road

Any such request must include “California Shine the Light Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address or mail address.
==========
As these rights and your CCPA rights are not the same and exist under different laws, you must exercise your rights under each law separately
Top
Nevada Residents
Nevada consumers have the right to instruct website operators to not sell certain personal information to third parties (often called “data brokers”) who will license or sell your information to other companies.
Transformco does not sell such information to data brokers and we have no plans to ever do so.
If we consider selling this information in the future, we will update this privacy policy to give you notice of this change and provide a formal method for Nevada consumers to exercise their opt-out rights under that law.

Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements
This Site may display ads from other companies.
We also partner with vendors to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated sites or apps.
Some of the ads on this Site or on other sites or apps may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your device’s browsing activity.

We may share your information with our service providers to permit them to recognize and serve targeted ads to you across the different devices you use.
Before we share your information, we transform, or “hash”, it so that it is not in personally identifiable form.

Your CCPA Rights
Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information
We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a Sale under the CCPA: (i) if you direct us to share PI; (ii) to comply with your requests under the CCPA; (iii) disclosures as part of a merger or asset sale; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
We do not believe that cookies operated by our vendors that facilitate online advertising or other activities in connection with our online services, which themselves Collect and share PI, are a sale by us of your PI under the CCPA.
However, we provide Consumers who use our online services a way to manage their cookie preferences based on categories of cookies through our management tool available here.
You will need to do this on each browser that you use to access our Site, and clearing cookies on your browser(s) may disable your preference settings.
==========
In addition, some third-party cookie operators that Collect PI in connection with our online services for advertising, analytics and other purposes offer you the ability to opt-out of their own downstream Sales.
Please visit here to opt-out of the Sale of PI by these third parties.
This is a third-party program and we are not responsible for its effectiveness.
==========
You must opt-out on every Device and browser you use in order to effectuate your requests to opt-out of the Sale of PI by these parties.
For more information on how to exercise choices regarding cookies and interest-based advertising, see the section above titled "Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements"
Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do-not-track signals, but like many website operators, we currently do not understand them to operate in that manner or to signify a request to opt-out of the Sale of your PI.
We understand that various parties are developing signals to communicate such requests, and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.
Rights to Know and Delete Personal Information
California Consumers have the right to exercise certain privacy rights under the CCPA.
==========
Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process.
We will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we Collected PI.
If you are unable to provide us with certain information about yourself or, in some cases, about your transaction history with us, we will be unable to verify your identity to fulfill a request to know or delete.
As an initial matter, we require you to provide your name, address, email address, and phone number to be submitted via our online request form or toll-free telephone number below.
In some cases, we may verify identity by confirming that you are the owner of the email address we have on file.
==========
For your specific pieces of information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply heightened verification standards, and reserve the right to request further information from you, in addition to the information mentioned above.
Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with a Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s PI (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a Pseudonymous browser ID).
As required by the CCPA, we do not include that PI in response to verifiable Consumer requests.
If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Collect, Process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.
==========
We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
You may use an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA to submit a consumer rights request.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require proof that the agent has been authorized by you to do so, and take other steps permissible under the CCPA, to ensure it is a proper request by an authorized agent.

==========
California Consumers may make a PI deletion request under the CCPA by calling us at 888-527-6415 or online at https://transformco.com/privacy/request.
If this request includes deleting your email address, then it will terminate your Program membership because that information is necessary for us to provide the Program.
Upon a termination request, some Program data associated with the terminated account may be retained for record keeping, tax reporting, and other legally permissible purposes.

California Shine the Light Law
California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
