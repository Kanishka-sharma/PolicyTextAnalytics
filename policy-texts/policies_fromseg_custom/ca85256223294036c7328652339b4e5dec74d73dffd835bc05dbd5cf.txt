==========
Some advertisements are chosen by companies that operate on our sites and other sites (for example, ad servers, ad networks, or technology platforms) to place ads on behalf of advertisers.
These companies may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit to our websites and may collect device advertising identifiers from your mobile device to learn about your use of apps, including ours.
The information they collect from our sites and apps is in a form that does not identify you personally and may be combined with similar data they obtain from other websites and apps to help advertisers better reach audiences they wish to target.
Targeting may be accomplished by tailoring advertising to interests that they infer from your browsing of our sites and apps and your interaction with other services where these companies also are present.
AOL also provides these types of services to advertisers; more information is described in the AOL privacy policy.
Advertising that is customized based on predictions generated from your visits over time and across different websites and apps is sometimes called “behavioral" or "interest-based" advertising.
In accordance with industry self-regulatory principles, we require that companies disclose when they are using online behavioral advertising programs to deliver third-party ads on our sites or collecting information about your visit to our sites for these purposes.
