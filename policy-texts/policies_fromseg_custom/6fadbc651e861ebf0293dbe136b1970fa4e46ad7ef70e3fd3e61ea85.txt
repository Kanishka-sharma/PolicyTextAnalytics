PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY
Teachable respects your privacy and is committed to being transparent with you about how we handle personal information.
This Privacy Policy explains how Teachable collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use the Teachable Platform, or otherwise interact with us.
It also goes over how you can exercise your privacy rights and choices.
==========
The Teachable Platform is designed to allow Creators to build, design, publish, and sell courses, coaching and other services to their Students.
This Privacy Policy applies when you access or use the services and tools offered through  our Platform (“Teachable Services”), or otherwise interact with us.
Your access to our Platform and use of Teachable Services is also governed by our Terms of Use.
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy can be found in our Terms of Use.
==========
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully prior to accessing our Platform and using Teachable Services.
If you have any questions, please contact us at: privacy@teachable.com.
Children
As stated in our Terms of Use, you must be at least 18 years old to use the Platform, or, if you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you must have your parent or guardian’s permission to use the Platform.
Teachable does not knowingly collect or store any personal information from or about children under the age of 13, and we will delete such information if we become aware that it has been submitted through our Platform.
Parents or guardians who believe that Teachable might have any personal information from or about a child under the age of 13 may submit a request to privacy@teachable.com for us to remove such information.
==========
Overview
Personal information refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.
How we handle your personal information will depend on whether we act as a “controller” or as a “processor” for the personal information.
The controller is the entity that decides how and why to process personal information.
The processor processes personal information on behalf of the controller at the controller’s direction.
Teachable is the controller of personal information that it collects and processes in connection with the use of our marketing site and the provision of Teachable Services.
This includes personal information that you provide to us when you create an account on the Teachable Platform, subscribe to a Teachable plan, enroll in a course,  purchase Coaching through our Platform, etc.
Please refer to the “Personal Information We Collect” section of this Privacy Policy for more information about personal information that Teachable collects as a controller.
==========
Creators are the owners of content that they upload, submit, or otherwise provide to the Teachable Platform (“Creator Content”) and are the controller with respect to any personal information included in their Creator Content.
Teachable processes Creator Content on behalf of the Creator as a processor.
When a Student enrolls in Creator Content, Teachable will provide the Creator access to a limited set of personal information about the Student (“Student Data”) to enable the Creator to provide their services to the Student.
Teachable and Creators may each use Student Data for their own business purposes, at all times subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Data Processing Agreement and our Terms of Use.
The Creator and Teachable each act as an independent controller with respect to their particular use of Student Data.
Creators acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the protection of personal information for which they are controllers.
==========

Depending on your location, you may have additional rights related to your personal information (see the Jurisdiction Specific Provisions section below for more information about location-specific privacy rights).

You may designate an authorized agent to make a data privacy request on your behalf.
