Information We Collect and How We Use It
When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.
==========
For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation.
We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation.
We will also use your email address to:
1) send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel,
2) notify you about special offers and promotions as described in the email section of this privacy statement,
3) send you copies of your hotel bills when you request them or subscribe to the eFolio feature, as well as
4) send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.
==========
You can opt out of marketing emails at any time.
You can also opt out of Marriott research surveys.
The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott Rewards promotion, enter a sweepstakes or online game, to enroll in the Marriott Rewards program or to redeem Marriott Rewards points.
==========
On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly.
For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address.
We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.
