Information about how you access those websites, apps, and other services, your browser or operating system, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the website you visited before visiting our Services.

Your IP address is not used for advertising targeting purposes, but only for fraud detection and security purposes, and also to be sent to advertising partners (such as demand side platforms).
How We Use the Information We Collect and Receive
Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to register you for our Impactify Services, to respond to requests that you make, to improve our Impactify Services and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Impactify Services, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality.
We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us.
How We Share the Information We Collect and Receive
We don’t rent or sell personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.
But we may share certain information we collect or receive with third parties to provide products and services you have requested, when we have your consent, or as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may share information with affiliates, business partners, other parties in response to legal process or when necessary to protect our Services.
We may disclose your information-including the contents of your communications with other parties-to other parties, such as when we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process, or other parties in connection with certain business transactions.
In the event that the ownership of Impactify or an affiliate or their assets changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to another company.
If we believe a transfer results in a material change in the use of the information we’ve collected or received about you, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of the transfer.

Companies that Provide Services to Impactify
Companies that provide services to us or act on our behalf may have access to information about you.
These companies are limited in their ability to use the information they receive in the course of providing services to us.
Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising Services, or Functionality on Our Services
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us.
Such third parties include: advertising providers, which help us and our advertising customers provide ads that are tailored to users’ interests and understand how users respond to those ads; and audience-measurement companies, which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services.
These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services.
Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads.
==========
“Do Not Track” Signals
Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates.
There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals.
Impactify currently does not take action in response to these signals.
If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.
==========
Choices Regarding Personal Information
Unsubscribe instructions will accompany each newsletter or promotional communication we send you.
You can always contact us in order to change your preferences with respect to informational/promotional contacts, by emailing us.
We will send you strictly service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notices of any updates to our Publisher Agreement or Privacy Policy) when it is necessary to do so.
You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account.
==========
Changes to Your Personal Information
In accordance with the Data Protection Act and the RGPD, you have a right to access, rectify and delete personal data about you, as well as a right to portability of your data.
You have a right to limit treatment, a right to oppose the treatment and a right to set guidelines on the fate of your personal data after your death.

==========
The Impactify Services display some of the information you enter when you create your account by registering as a Publisher, such as your username (or display name) and address.
If you wish to change your contact information, you may login to your Impactify account, select the “Account” option, and edit your contact details.
To prevent any other information from the account being displayed by the Impactify Services, you may contact us by email to delete your account.

==========
Opt-out
Impactify is able to improve the relevance of the ads displaying on your browser with cookies.
When consulting websites using Impactify Services, an information banner on these sites informs you of the deposit of advertising cookies and asks you to consent to them.
However, if you do not want an advertising cookie on your browser, you can disable them on those websites.
This will prevent Impactify from collecting anonymous data.
You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from us when you browse the web by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer choice page.
Please note that your opt-out choice will apply only to the browser and device you are using when you opt out.
==========
Our Commitment to Security
Although no one can guarantee the security of the information collected and received, we do employ a number of safeguards intended to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or disclosure of this information.
Examples of the types of safeguards we may provide (depending on the circumstances) include:

Storing the data you provide in controlled facilities;
Using HTTPS encryption when you authenticate (i.e., log into one of our Services), which helps prevent unauthorized access to your login credentials;
Limiting access to personal information to employees who need that access to perform their jobs; and
Providing company-wide training on privacy and data security.
Privacy of Minors
We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old.
Changes to This Privacy Policy and Additional Information
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this Policy periodically.
If there are significant changes to Impactify’s information practices, you will be provided with appropriate online notice.
