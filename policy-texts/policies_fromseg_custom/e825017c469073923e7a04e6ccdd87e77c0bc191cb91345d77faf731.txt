      emails to you of both promotional and transactional in nature.
Out of
      respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving promotional
      emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails
      or you can contact us at [insert contact info here].
We will also
      send you service related email announcements on rare occasions when it is
      necessary to do so.
For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended
      for maintenance, we might send you an email.
You do not have an option to
      opt out of these emails, which are not promotional in nature.
==========
Download/backup your form data.
We provide you
      with the ability to export, share and publish your form data in a variety
      of formats.
==========
This allows you to create your own backups or work with your
      data offline.
See here for data
        exporting instructions.
Delete your form data.
You can delete
      your form data (including parts of forms, entire forms and responses to
      forms) through your account's user interface.
See here for how to delete form
        entries.
==========
Cancel your Wufoo account.
You can cancel
      your Wufoo account at any time through your account management page.
Any
      cancellation of your Wufoo account will result in the deletion of your
      account and all form data stored in it.
This data cannot be recovered once
      your account is cancelled.
==========
Please be aware that SurveyMonkey may for a
      time retain residual information in our backup and/or archival copies of
      our database which takes up to about 12 months to disappear.
EU Users.
==========
Some account holders and other individuals (including those whose
      information we receive under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the U.S.-Swiss
      Safe Harbor) have certain legal rights to obtain information of whether we
      hold personal information about them, to access personal information we
      hold about them, and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or
      deletion in appropriate circumstances.
For some information, these
      rights may be exercised through your account management page, and in all
      cases, requests to exercise these rights may be directed to our customer support team.
These rights are subject to some exceptions, such as where giving you
      access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other
      individuals.
We will respond to your request to exercise these rights
      within a reasonable time and, where required by law or where we deem it
      otherwise appropriate and practicable to do so, we will honor your
      request.

==========
Security, cookies and other important information

Security.
Each Form Creator is assigned a
      unique username and password which is required to access their Wufoo
      account.
It is each Form Creator's responsibility to protect the security
      of his or her login information.
==========
Regardless of the security protections
      and precautions we undertake, there is always a risk that your personal
      data may be viewed and used by unauthorized third parties as a result of
      collecting and transmitting your data over the internet.
If you have any
      questions about the security of your personal information, please contact customer support .

      may ask advertising networks and exchanges to display ads promoting our
      services on other websites.
We may ask them to deliver those ads based on
      the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other
      personal information with the advertiser.
Our advertising network partners
      may use cookies and page tags or web beacons to collect certain
      non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites
      to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests.
==========

      do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you
      such targeted ads, you may opt-out at http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ or,
      if you're located in the European Union, at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.
You will continue to receive generic ads.
==========

      statement may be changed in the same manner as changes that are made to
      SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy.
If we make any
      material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address
      specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior
      to the change becoming effective.
We encourage you to periodically review
      this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
==========
Online tracking.
We currently do
      not process or comply with any web browser's "do not track"
      signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable
      online tracking of individual users who visit the Wufoo website or use the
      Wufoo services.
==========
privacy for form respondents
1.
What information does SurveyMonkey collect?
Responses to forms.
We collect and
      store the responses that you submit to forms.
==========
Form Creators are
      responsible for this data and manage it.
A form may ask you to provide
      personal information or data.
If you have any questions about a form you
      are completing, please contact the Form Creator who created the form
      directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that form.
The creator of the form is usually the same person that invited you to
      complete the form and sometimes they have their own privacy policy.
SurveyMonkey
      is not liable for any actions or inactions a Form Creator takes with
      respect to any data or information that they may collect from a Form
      Respondent.
2.
==========
How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?
We disclose the information we collect in accordance with 
      SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy
    for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data
    should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo).
3.
==========
With whom do we share or disclose your information?
We disclose the information we collect in accordance with
    SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy
    for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data
    should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo).
4.
==========
What are your rights to your information?
Contact the relevant Form Creator to access
        your responses.
Because we collect form responses on
      behalf of Form Creators and have no direct relation with form respondents,
      you will need to contact the Form Creator (the data controller) if you
      have any questions about the form, or if you no longer like to be
      contacted by them, or if you want to access, update, or delete anything in
      your responses.
If requested to remove data we will
      respond within a reasonable timeframe.
==========
We may transfer personal
      information to companies that help us provide our service.
Transfers to
      subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our
      Clients.
We will retain your personal information (including information we
      process on behalf of the Form Creators) for as long as needed to provide
      services to our Form Creators.
Wufoo will retain this personal information as
      necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
      agreements.
==========
We provide Form Creators with tools to
      maintain the responses they collect through their forms.
SurveyMonkey
      cannot provide you with this access since form responses are the Form
      Creator's private information.
==========

        Want to know why Wufoo is the best web form builder?
When you design a web form with Wufoo, it automatically
        builds the database, backend, and scripts needed to make collecting and understanding your data easy, fast, and
        fun.
==========
Because we host everything, all you need is a browser, an Internet connection, and a few minutes to build a
        web form and start using it right away.
At Wufoo, we believe web forms are the starting point for building
        anything useful on the web.
==========
Basically, they’re the most efficient mechanisms for collecting data from people.
The problem is sometimes using a web form builder isn’t very efficient.
The process of building a web form and
        all the database structures and scripts necessary to make it work (not to mention useful) is a really tedious
        process that makes what should be a simple task (collecting and understanding information) not really worth the
        time, effort, or cost of the endeavor.
The entire process could take you or your IT person days, if not weeks.
With Wufoo, you can skip all the hard stuff (because it does it all for you) and start getting things done.
