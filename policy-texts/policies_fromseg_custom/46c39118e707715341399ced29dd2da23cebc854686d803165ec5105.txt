Our Websites include community areas (e.g., forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms) in which you may participate after establishing a Membership Account.
Although your participation in these communities is governed by this privacy policy, there are certain important characteristics of these communities that you should always keep in mind.

We use Membership Account registration information and other information users provide as they interact within the communities to: authenticate users; provide communications from us to users regarding the community; and administer the community (including, but not limited to, managing the technical requirements of the site and monitoring submissions and posts for offensive content after posting and removing such content in our sole discretion).

You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to a community as public information.
For this reason, we urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user of the information you provide in a submission or post.
Upon termination of a community, Personal Information we collected through the community will continue to be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.
