LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so.
The legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use your personal information.
In almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following: 
When the processing is necessary to fulfil a contract that we have in place with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you), for example where you have expressed interest in our products and SaleCycle are in discussions with you about supplying our products to you; 
Where we have your consent to our use of your personal data, for example consent to process your date on our website;
When the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests, to ensure that our services are properly provided and to promote our services, for example business to business marketing of our services; or
Where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation, for example should we be requested to share information with a regulator or government organisation.
==========
WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
The personal information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), including countries, which have less strict, or no data protection laws, when compared to those in Europe or the United Kingdom.
Whenever we transfer your information as described in the paragraph above, we will take steps which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and to make sure it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
In these cases, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (such as the EU “Standard Contractual Clauses” and the EU-US “Privacy Shield”) to ensure your information is subject to adequate safeguards in the recipient country.
HOW WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take steps to ensure that the personal information that you provide is retained for only as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
==========
After this period it will be deleted or in some cases anonymised.
For example, where you have made a purchase with us, we will keep a record of your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, tax, legal claim and warranty purposes (where applicable).
We may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim.
Where we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue with that processing, if you subsequently withdraw your consent then we will delete your personal information, subject to any exemptions which may permit us to retain your data under data protection legislation.
==========
Please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.
