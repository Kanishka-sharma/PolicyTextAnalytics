Rubicon Project Advertising Technology Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 19, 2015
Rubicon Project is committed to transparency, and we want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to you, and the choices that are available to you.
This privacy policy governs Rubicon Project’s collection and use of data on websites and apps that use Rubicon Project’s technology to sell and purchase ads.
This privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of data on our website (http://www.rubiconproject.com) — that information can be found here.
Information We Collect
When you visit a website or application that uses our technology, we collect certain information about you and your device (“User Information”).
Some of this User Information, including for example your IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device, and may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere.
User Information that we may collect includes: IP address, domain, browser type and language, referring website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search keywords, visitor activities and actions on publisher’s sites, browser history, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation (including city, country, zip code, and potentially geographic coordinates if you have enabled location services on your device), click data, types of advertisements viewed, and information about a visitor’s device including device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type.
We do not collect any “sensitive personal data” as defined under European data protection laws.
How We Collect User Information
We use cookies and similar technologies to collect User Information.
==========
In particular, we use the following standard web technologies:

“Tags and Pixels” are blocks of code that we and our customers may use to track your navigation of websites or apps using our technology, and your browsing behavior.
We use pixels to coordinate User Information with our customers and other third parties.
“Cookies” are data files that often include a unique identifier, and are placed on a visitor’s device or computer.
We use cookies on our customers’ websites in order to operate our technology and collect User Information.
For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies,  visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org
“SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” are blocks of code similar to tags and pixels that are embedded into an app that allow us to track certain information relating to your use of apps using our technology.
Additionally, we use other technologies, including locally stored objects, to collect User Information in order to assist with the delivery of ads and to provide reporting to our customers.
Finally, we use standard device identifiers, for example the “IDFA” advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices, to track your use of mobile apps.
These technologies enable us to help our advertising customers better understand and advertise to their online audience.
How We Use Information
We primarily use User Information to enable our customers to find and buy advertising space on publishers’ websites and mobile applications.
In particular, our customers (and, to a lesser extent, we) may use User Information in conjunction with other information they have independently collect deliver you targeted advertising they believe will be of particular interest to you.
For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.
Our other uses of User Information may include, for example, to:

Operate and improve our technology;
Conduct research and development;
Enable standard advertising controls;
Prepare reports that summarize visitor activity;
Report on ad performance, campaign reporting, and campaign forecasting;
Assess user response to advertisements and promotions; and
Protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.
==========
Information Retention
We may store the User Information we collect, such as IP address and other information described above, for up to 90 days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
We may store the aggregated summary data (which for example, does not include IP address or other information that may be tied to a particular browser or device) for longer than 90 days.
Sharing of Information
We share User Information with others, including advertisers, advertising agencies, and website and app publishers, for a variety of reasons.
For example:

We share User Information with our customers to help them identify and buy advertising on publishers’ websites and mobile applications.
Customers may use User Information in conjunction with other information they have independently collected in order to provide you targeted advertising and to help them evaluate whether a particular ad campaign may be of interest to you.
We may share User Information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets to a third party buyer.
We may share User Information for legal, protection, security, and safety purposes, including:

to comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests and legal process;
to protect the rights and property of Rubicon Project, our agents, customers, and others, including enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of use and protecting our network and physical assets; and/or
in an emergency, including protecting the safety of our employees and agents, our customers, or any person.
We may share information with parties who may use that information to provide us with services or do work for us.
Information Our Customers Collect
Our customers and other third parties who use our technology may use their own tags, pixels, cookies, or other similar technology (or those of their other affiliates) within their advertisements and on certain websites.
These customers maintain their own privacy policies and processes.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of customers that use our technology.
==========
Your Opt-Out Choices
There are many ways to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising that our customers may conduct using our technology.
If you opt-out of targeted advertising, we will continue to collect the same User Information described above.
However, this information won’t be used to target you with interest based ads.

Additionally, you can opt-out by using any of the following three mechanisms.
