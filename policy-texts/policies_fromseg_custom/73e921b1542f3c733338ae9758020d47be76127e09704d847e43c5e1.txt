Types of information that may be collected
 For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, email address, etc. whether used alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual.
The personal information we collect is used to facilitate the purchase and delivery of tickets and/or other products, services, or information to our customers, and we may require our customers to provide certain personal information in some instances.
We also collect non-personal information such as browsing patterns, geographic location and demographics, which does not reveal your specific identity, as further described below.
The categories of information collected by our Mobile App will be disclosed at the time you download the Mobile App from the applicable mobile application "store" using your mobile device, and are also described below.
==========
Please read the following to learn more about our data collection policies and practices:

We may require users and/or      customers wishing to participate in any of our contests, drawings,      sweepstakes, promotions, newsletters, or other interactive features which      may or may not involve a purchase to complete an entry or similar form which      will require the submission of certain personal information.
The personal information that may      be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited      to, customer's first name, last name, zip code, phone number, age and      email address.
Winners of contests, drawings, sweepstakes, and/or      promotions will be required to provide additional personal information      such as a shipping address and telephone number.
If the privacy policy      varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that      information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or      feature's terms of use.
In order to complete the purchase      of a ticket, a product and/or service on the Site or Mobile App, an online      credit card transaction is required.
==========
During this process we generate and      collect certain personal information.
The personal information that may be collected from our customers in completion of a ticket, product and/or service purchase, includes, but may not be limited to: customer's first and last name, first and last name of the credit card owner, credit card billing address, credit card number, credit card security code, credit card expiration date, customer's shipping address, phone number, and email address.
You may also have the opportunity to permit us to maintain this information in a personal profile for you so you do not have to re-enter the information each time you make a purchase.
==========
If a customer sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
If you choose to use our AXS InviteTM feature, we ask you for your friend's name and email address.
We will send your friend an invite email on your behalf.

Contests or Sweepstakes
 We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Services, which may require registration in order to enter.

Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our marketing lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes.
Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Services, such as on a winner's page.
In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Services, and collect your information.
In those cases, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy, before participating.
==========
Surveys or Voting
 From time-to-time we may request personal information from you via surveys or voting polls.
Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information.
At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.
==========
By completing the survey, you consent to our collection of any Personal Information and other data you provide, and use of that personal information and other data to administer, respond to, analyze or otherwise complete the survey process or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
If you use our Mobile App
If you download and use our Mobile App, we or third party service providers may collect certain information through that Mobile App.
Information collected may include the personal information and other registration, login, or payment information you choose to provide; information about your device, such as your IP address, OS, device model, your device's proprietary advertising identifier; and information relating to how you use the Mobile App, such as the content you view, ads you click, and purchases you make.

We may use data collected from physical proximity beacons (which may be located in some of the venues or events for which we have sold tickets) to send you relevant, targeted offers based on this data (for example, a discount on food purchases near our event).
We and any third parties enabling these features may store this data and combine it with other information about you.
You may disable the communication of these beacons with your mobile device by disabling Bluetooth or modifying your preferences for location services through your OS.
==========
We collect the information primarily to facilitate the functionality of our Mobile App and deliver relevant content to you.
For example, we may collect your registration and payment information so we can show you content that interests you and to process transactions on your behalf.
We may collect your device's location in order to show you offers or features available near you, to deliver more relevant information and ads, and to understand how users interact with a venue or at events we have ticketed.
We may combine data we collect through our Mobile App with other information we hold about you so that we can personalize or improve the relevance and quality of the services we provide you.
==========
Tracking Technologies 
 AXS and our Partners may employ industry common tracking technologies such as: cookies, beacons or pixel tags, and scripts on the Services to provide you with an efficient and personalized experience, to help us better understand our users, and to present information we or our Partners believe would be of interest to you.
Analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Omniture Reports & Analytics are used in analyzing trends, administering the Services, tracking users' movements around the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

Behavioral Targeted Advertising/Ad Re-targeting
 We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other sites.
Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Services and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.
We or a third party may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, which may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, that we may share with a data provider or other third party.
==========
These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver relevant, personalized advertisements or content to you on our Services or third party sites; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.
To achieve these purposes, our partners may use the shared information in a number of ways, including (i) to evaluate the nature of the connection across your devices, browsers, or applications; (ii) to assess the suitability of your desktop or mobile device for interest- or demographic-based content; (iii) to provide information and inferences about user interests to third parties; and (iv) to develop insights and reports relating to the presentation of customized advertisements or content, including statistical reports in connection with activity on a website, optimization of ad placement and performance, development of reach and frequency metrics, billing activities, and tracking ads served on a particular day to a particular website.
Our partners may also combine shared information with additional non-identifying information collected from other sources to enhance these activities.
==========
We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Services.

When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Services, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or Site functionality.
==========
