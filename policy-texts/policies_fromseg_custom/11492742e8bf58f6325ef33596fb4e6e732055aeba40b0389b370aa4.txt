Scope of This Privacy Policy
This Policy applies to personally identifiable personal information, or "personal information," that we collect when you sign up to become a member, shop in one of our stores, visit any of our websites (collectively, the "site"), or use or access our other products or services.
It also applies to personal information we collect when you otherwise interact with us, such as when you make a payment, place an order, sign up for an activity, or contact customer service.
This Policy also applies to personal information that we may receive from our partners and third-party sources.
Personal Information
Personal information under this Policy is personal information that we directly associate with a specific person such as the person's name, address, phone or fax number, email address, account information (e.g., member account, credit card information and online registration), online activities or other specific personal information.
Because of the broad range of services and product offerings at REI, we collect other very specific personal information.
==========
For instance, on the membership application, we may collect age or date and year of birth and the number of children in your family.
For the REI Adventures program and for gear rentals, we may need to collect vital statistics such as height and weight and athletic ability.
Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" personal information.
This is information that we collect about a group or category of services or people that does not contain any personal information or from which we or our agents remove any personal information.
Collection of Personal Information
We collect personal information about you in the normal course of our business when you shop at our stores or on our site or when you use our services or otherwise interact with us.
==========
Various ways in which we may obtain personal information from you are described below.
Personal Information You Provide.
We collect personal information that varies with your purchases, interests, and activities and what you chose to provide to us.
We collect personal information when you sign up for, purchase, or use our products or services, when you sign up to become a member, or when you email, call or otherwise communicate with us.
For example, we collect personal information about you and your family on our membership application and when you sign up for REI Adventures or REI Outdoor School.
You may submit personal information with a job application or in your resume that you provide as part of an employment application process.
We also collect personal information when you call or email our customer service representatives, when you pay for a service, or when you contact us about a product or service you have previously purchased.
For more examples of personal information we collect, please see Other Examples of Personal Information REI Tends to Collect.
==========
In some cases, the personal information we ask you to provide will be mandatory for purposes of participating in a particular activity or service.
If you do not provide this personal information, your participation may be limited or prohibited.
Automatically Collected Personal Information.
We receive certain types of personal information automatically whenever you use our services.
For example, when your web browser accesses our site, we obtain certain types of personal information, such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, and the page you visited before visiting our site.
==========
Personal information From Other Sources.
We may receive personal information about you from other sources.
For example, we may receive creditworthiness or other financial personal information when you fill out a job application.
==========
If a third party purchases a gift card or certificate to give to you, then we may receive information about you from the purchaser so that we can complete the sale and deliver the card or certificate.
We may also purchase certain personal information from others to better inform you about our products, services, and offers that we think will interest you.
This Policy applies to personal information we obtain from other sources as well as to any personal information that we add to or combine with personal information otherwise covered by this Policy.
Our Use of Personal Information
We use the personal information we collect for a variety of purposes; for example, to provide products or services, process and complete transactions, ship or otherwise deliver goods or services, respond to requests, make internal business decisions, evaluate available offers and make decisions about services offered, protect our rights or property, create products and services, anticipate and resolve actual or potential problems with our products and services, and inform you of REI products, services and offers that we believe you will find of interest.
Below are some additional, more specific examples of how we use personal information:
We use your name and postal address to provide our printed catalog and other materials via the mail.
REI sends emails about news, clinics and events, Gearmail, membership promotions and general promotions.
We use your billing and credit card personal information to process your orders for products and services, to deliver products and services to you, and to bill you for them.
We may use your personal information to verify and validate your identity.
If you submit a job application or resume to us, we may use the personal information in the application or resume to communicate with you and, subject to laws and regulations that govern our consideration of that personal information, to evaluate your qualifications for employment.
==========
We may aggregate information about your activities and services to help us determine your potential interest in other products or services.
For marketing and similar purposes, we may use personal information to offer products and services from us or others.
We also offer opt-out choices, which you may access by clicking on the link.
Although our site is intended primarily for U.S. users, we offer outdoor experiences and other events that take place in other countries and, in a global economy, we do not conduct every aspect of our business in just one country.
==========
We may transfer personal information about you worldwide in any manner consistent with this Policy.
We keep information as a record of our interactions with you.
If you place an order or otherwise deal with us or our representatives over the telephone, we may record the conversation.
Personal information referenced in the call may be recorded or entered into another media (e.g., a computer).
We may also keep logs of online chat and emails we receive from you.
==========
We may provide notice of unauthorized access or other invasions of certain security systems, as required by law or otherwise.
We may do so by posting notice on our site or sending notice to any email address we have for you, or by other means.
You understand that notice to you will count as notice to others using your account or membership and you agree to pass this notice on to them.
==========
We may use personal information about you to deal with legal process, below, and to comply with corporate laws that allow REI members to examine certain corporate books and records (such as minutes of member meetings and names and addresses of members entitled to vote).
We may use personal information about you in an attempt to do any or all of these kinds of things: (i) prevent or investigate fraud, crimes, unauthorized use of personal information or the site, or economic or personal harm to anyone (including REI); (ii) facilitate product recalls; and (iii) to investigate, protect, defend, or enforce rights and property of REI or anyone else.
In listing these types of actions where we may use personal information, we are not promising to take any such action and we will take or not take such action in our sole discretion.
It is impossible to list every lawful use that we might make of personal information and the above examples are not intended to do so - they are only a general description and are for illustration.
==========
Disclosure of Personal Information
Except as described in this Policy, our business practice is to not disclose personal information about you outside of REI and its affiliates without your consent.
We disclose personal information as follows:
With Your Consent.
We disclose personal information about you to third parties with your consent.
We may obtain consent from you in several ways, such as in a form or agreement; online, through "click-through" agreements or registration pages; verbally, through interactive voice response; or when your consent is part of the terms and conditions through which we provide you a particular product or service.
Your consent is sometimes implicit.
For example, if you purchase a product from a store or through our site and ask that it be shipped to your home or other address, you implicitly consent to our disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery, of your credit card number to the credit card processor to authorize the transaction, and to the bank to collect payment.
==========
Product or Service Fulfillment.
We may disclose personal information to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf, transactions on your behalf, or transfers related to providing products or services to you.
For example, we may contract with third parties to host a site, collect and provide products re
