RightNow anti-spam policy overview
As spam proliferates, non-delivery has become a major aggravation
for email service providers and marketers.
To combat spam, Internet
service providers are filtering out spam.
==========
The problem is that large
amounts of valid commercial emails are filtered out with it.
For many
organizations, running an effective email marketing campaign has
become a highly complex affair.
They struggle to make their messages
stand out above the fray and most importantly to find ways to pass
through the bulk mail trap of increasingly effective spam filters.
==========
RightNow is committed to assisting its customers to effectively
deliver legitimate email.
RightNow is also committed to the
prevention of spam email.
This Policy Statement lists the measures
that RightNow has set in place to achieve these twin objectives.
==========
Delivery Management Team
RightNow has created a standing committee, the Delivery Management
Team (DMT) to oversight all activities related to the two objectives.
The DMT is chaired by the Vice President & General Counsel who is
a member of the Company's Executive Management Team, and comprises
representatives from the Marketing, Development, Hosting, Customer
Service, and Professional Services Departments.
In addition, RightNow
has appointed a Deliverability Management Officer to support the DMT,
and to be a source of deliverability expertise to RightNow's staff and
customers.
License Conditions
As a condition of the right to use its software, RightNow requires all
customers to agree that they will not use the software to send
unsolicited commercial email.
Specifically, licensees expressly
contract that they will not conceal the identity of an email sender,
that they will provide their end users with a user friendly means to
opt-out of email communications, and that they will not engage in
activities that are reasonably likely to lead to spam complaints.
License conditions give RightNow the right to investigate spam
infringements, and to suspend or terminate licenses.
==========
Maintain ISP Relationships
RightNow actively works with top Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
to ensure that we understand their ever-changing email filtering
requirements, their white list criteria (if applicable) and their
future directions.
By staying in good standing with ISPs, we are also
better able to assist in resolving the inevitable problems that our
customers will experience with ISPs.
==========
Complaints Procedures
RightNow will promptly respond to any complaints about spam.
Any
such complaint should be sent to abuse@rightnow.com.
==========
Membership of Anti-Spam
Organizations
To communicate with the ISPs and work toward resolving spam issues,
RightNow, along with several top email service providers has joined
the Email Sender and Provider Coalition (ESPC).
The ESPC was formed by
the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) to fight spam while
protecting the delivery of legitimate email.
Monitoring of Domestic and
International Spam and Privacy Legislation
RightNow is dedicated to monitoring current domestic and
international spam legislation.
==========
In this way, we can assist our
customers to ensure that all outbound communications are compliant
with the latest policies and procedures.
Provide Customers with Email Delivery
Best Practices
We receive a wealth of information about best practices in email
delivery through our implementation and consulting engagements, our
relationships with ISPs, our monitoring of national and international
legislation, our membership of anti-spam organizations, and through
resolution of complaints.
RightNow provides the best of this
information back to our customers in the form of Best Practices
collateral, white papers, webcasts, and consulting engagements.
The
objective is to provide our customers with a blueprint of how to
deliver successful outbound email communications.
