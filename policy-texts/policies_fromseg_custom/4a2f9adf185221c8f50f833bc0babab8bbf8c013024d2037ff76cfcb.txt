What information does OneLogin collect?
Information you provide: When you register for the Service, we require your name, company name, e-mail, and phone number.
After the initial registration, the Subscriber’s designated Client Administrator can share additional user information with OneLogin in order to enable those individuals to use the Service, and never collects any individual information, personal or otherwise, without the explicit direction of the Client Administrator.
Subscribers are responsible for providing notice to their individual users concerning the user information they share with OneLogin as part of the delivery of the Service.
Cookies: When you visit the Web site or use the Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Web site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable OneLogin to process your online transactions.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Web site.
Session cookies also help us verify your identity and are required in order to use the Service.
OneLogin uses persistent cookies, that only OneLogin can read and use, to identify you as a valid user of a OneLogin Subscription plan and make it easier for you to log in to the Service.
The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our Privacy Policy Statement.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
==========
Clear Gifs: We employ or our third party advertising and tracking tools employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the movements of the visitors to our Web site.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our Visitors and Subscribers in order to optimize and enhance the Web site and Service experience.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
==========
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Log Files: As is true of most Web sites, we and our third party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Web site, to track users’ movements while on the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
==========
Analytics and Remarketing: OneLogin uses Remarketing with Google Analytics and/or services like AdRoll to advertise online.
Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet.
OneLogin and and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website.
You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using Google’s Ads Preferences Manager.
