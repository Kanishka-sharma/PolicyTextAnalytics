The BBC puts advertising on its website for users outside the UK.
We use the income to help fund BBC services and keep the licence fee, (paid by UK households), lower than it otherwise would be.

If you've seen what you believe to be inappropriate advertising on our site, please read this FAQ for advice and details on how to let us know.
We try our utmost, using sophisticated technology, to make sure that the advertising is only visible to people outside the UK, but if you are viewing the website from within the UK and you can see advertising, please use this form to let us know as soon as possible.

If you are visiting this website from outside the UK then you will be viewing the international version, BBC.com, which carries advertising delivered by BBC Worldwide, a commercial subsidiary of the BBC.
Some of the advertising displayed may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing of and interactions with the BBC website and third party sites; a practice widely used across the internet and known as online behavioural advertising (OBA).
What is Behavioural Advertising?
Behavioural advertising, or interest-based advertising, gives you and our advertisers a more valuable and unique experience by delivering advertising and content that is more relevant to your interests, based upon your previous browsing activity on this website as well as third party sites.
It is important to note that at no time do we or our service providers attempt to identify you individually nor do we create a profile of you, or the pages you have viewed, for the purposes of delivering advertising.
We use cookies and your IP address to discover general information about which pages on our sites you visit and the country, city or region in which you are located.
==========
We sometimes combine this with information provided to us by third parties, together this information enables you to be grouped with other people with similar interests and places you in a market segment.
We may then display advertisements which we believe people in your market segment will find relevant.
==========
We believe this makes the advertising more interesting and useful to you, and also helps us increase the value we get out of the site from our advertisers, and therefore ultimately gives us a greater ability to invest in great content for the benefit of all our users.
We may also allow advertisers to use their own marketing data to target advertising campaigns on this website and as a result you may see advertising based upon website content you have been viewing on another website.
For example, a retailer might use information about the products you browsed on their website in order to tailor their advert to you on this website.
This information is not shared with us and we do not share information with the advertiser about your browsing of our website.

Advertising-related Cookies
The ads seen by users outside of the UK are served in association with our approved ad partners.
The cookies accompanying the ads allow them and their advertisers to monitor the effectiveness of the ads (e.g. by using analytical cookies) and to make the ads more relevant to you based on your browsing behaviour (e.g. by using behavioural targeting cookies).
==========

We are committed to following best practice in our use of online behavioural targeting technology and we at all times seek to comply with applicable legal and regulatory frameworks, such as that of the Digital Advertising Alliance.
If at any time you do not want information about your browsing behaviour to be used for the purposes of delivering advertising to you on this website, you can "opt out" using the tools provided by our ad partners below.

Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting
DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.
This website does not currently respond to DNT requests, however, you may opt-out of tracking on this website, including analytics (and tailored advertising if you are visiting from outside the UK), by changing your cookie settings here.
A uniform standard has not yet been adopted to determine how DNT requests should be interpreted and what actions should be taken by websites and third parties.
The BBC will continue to review DNT and other new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once available.
