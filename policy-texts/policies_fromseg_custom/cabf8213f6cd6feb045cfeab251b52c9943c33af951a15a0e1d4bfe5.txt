NOTICE SPECIFIC TO PERSONS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION
If you are located in the EU, then our processing of your personal information may fall under Regulation 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation, or the “GDPR”).
In addition to the privacy information provided above, there is additional information specific to the EU legal framework below.
Please also see our GDPR resources webpage for more information.
==========
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING
Our processing activities of your personal information will rely on different lawful grounds depending on the circumstances.
Generally speaking, we typically rely on the following lawful bases in order to process your personal information under the GDPR:

Necessity to enter or for the performance of a contract (ex: for online applications you submit; for the information provided when enrolling; for the payment information we process for tuition);
Necessity for our legitimate interests or those of third parties (our legitimate interest to maintain a community for alumni);
Consent (for the research projects you may participate in; for processing of special categories of personal data).
YOUR RIGHTS
The U-M is committed to facilitating the exercise of the rights granted to you by EU data protection law in a timely manner.
In the context of our processing activities that are subject to the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal information:

Access, correction and other requests – You have the right to obtain confirmation of whether we process your personal data, as well as the right to obtain information about the personal data we process about you.
You also have a right to obtain a copy of this data.
Additionally, and under certain circumstances, you may have the right to obtain erasure, correction, restriction and portability of your personal data.
Right to object – You have the right to object to receiving marketing materials from us by following the opt-out instructions in our marketing emails, as well as the right to object to any processing of your personal data based on your specific situation.
In the latter case, we will assess your request and provide a reply in a timely manner, according to our legal obligations.
Right to withdrawal consent – For all the processing operations that are based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, and we will stop those processing operations as allowable by law.
Please note that when you make requests based on these rights, if we are not certain of your identity, we may need to ask you for further personal information to be used only for the purposes of replying to your request.
==========
RETENTION PERIOD
We strive to keep personal data in our records only as long as necessary for the purposes they were collected and processed.
Retention periods vary and are established considering our legitimate interests and all applicable legal requirements.
DATA TRANSFERS
When you interact with the U-M, your personal information is transferred to the United States.
The United States is not currently among the countries outside the European Union that have been deemed by the European Commission to have an adequate level of legal protections for personal information.
To ensure the lawful transfers of personal information from the EU, the U-M relies on the derogations laid out in Article 49 GDPR.
In particular, we rely on your explicit consent for some of the transfers and on necessity for the performance of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request (for instance, for the transfer of personal data necessary for your application for admission).
However, please be aware that we provide safeguards for the information transferred, as required by the GDPR itself and in accordance with this General Privacy Statement.
==========
CONCERNS
If you have any concerns or questions about how your personal data is used, please contact us at privacy@umich.edu.
We will promptly respond to your request and do our best to address your concern.
However, if you believe we have not been able to deal with your concern appropriately, you have a right to complain to your local data protection authority, as granted by Article 77 of the GDPR.
You also have the right to submit a complaint in the Member State of your residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR.
