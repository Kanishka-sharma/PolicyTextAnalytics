Cookie Use Notice
On a limited number of its web pages, the Bureau of Labor Statistics employs
    "cookies" to provide better service to its customers.
We do not use cookies to
    collect any personally identifying information from users or to track user activities
    beyond our web site.
We do not maintain copies of cookies on our web site after you leave
    our web site.
Cookies are small pieces of temporary data that are exchanged between a web site and a
    user's computer which enable a "session", or "dialog", to be
    established between the two machines.
With the session established, BLS is able to tailor
    its responses (i.e., identify and provide you with the information you want) and help you
    traverse our web pages in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
==========
The Bureau of Labor Statistics limits its use of cookies to "session
    cookies"...types of cookies that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory.
Session cookies are normally deleted from a user's computer when the user logs off the
    computer or the user exits the browser.
==========
As of October 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
    does not issue "persistent cookies"...types of cookies that could be stored
    permanently on your workstation and reused each time you visit the Department's web site.
Before October 2000 however, BLS had a small number of web sites that automatically
    created persistent cookies.
Those cookies may still be stored on some user's computers
    and, in some cases, may be updated by the user's browser when revisiting the BLS web site.
In the event a cookie is found on your workstation which was issued from a BLS web site,
    you may remove it without adversely affecting your future visits to our web site.
At no
    time did BLS track users or store any personal information.

Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are
    strictly prohibited and my be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986
    and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
