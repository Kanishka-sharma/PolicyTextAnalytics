Fees and Payment
a. Fees and Payment.
All charges associated with Customer’s Account (“Fees”) are set forth in the applicable SOF or Website, and are due and payable in full within thirty (30) days from the invoice date or as stated in the applicable SOF.
Payment obligations are non-cancelable, regardless of utilization by the Customer and except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Fees paid are non-refundable.
Customer will pay the Fees through an accepted payment method as specified in the applicable SOF or Website.
Unless otherwise set forth in the SOF, Customer’s subscription to the Services will renew automatically for a Subscription Term in accordance with the renewal terms and conditions set forth in Section 6(b) below.
During the Term, the Customer may not reduce their Service Plan or User count.
b. Late Payments.
If undisputed Fees are more than thirty (30) days overdue, then, following written notification from Freshworks, Freshworks may suspend Customer’s access to the Freshworks Technology, including, without limitation, Customer’s Account, until such unpaid Fees are paid in full.
==========
c. Payment Disputes.
Freshworks will not exercise its rights under Section 5(b) (Late Payments), 6(d) (Termination for Cause) or Section 6(c)(i) (Suspension of Service) with respect to non-payment by Customer if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.
If the parties are unable to resolve such a dispute within thirty (30) days, each party will have the right to seek any remedies it may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any terms that would limit remedies on account of a dispute.
For clarity, any undisputed amounts must be paid in full.
==========
d. Applicable Taxes.
The Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”).
==========
Customer agrees to pay applicable direct or indirect Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder, which, to the extent Freshworks is legally required to collect the same, will be itemized on the Freshworks invoice.
If Customer has an obligation to withhold any amounts under any law or tax regime (other than U.S. income tax law), Customer will gross up the payments so that the Freshworks receives the amount actually quoted and invoiced.
If Freshworks has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, the appropriate amount will be invoiced and paid by the Customer, unless, prior to the invoice date, the Customer provides Freshworks with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.
==========
Additional information on how Freshworks may apply tax requirements can be found at https://www.freshworks.com/company/sales-and-service-tax-faqs/. 
e. Orders by Affiliates.
Customer’s Affiliates may purchase Services directly from Freshworks by executing an SOF which is governed by the terms of this Agreement.
Such SOF will establish a new and separate agreement between the Customer’s Affiliate and the Freshworks entity signing such SOF.
If the Affiliate resides in a different country than Customer, then the SOF may include modifications to terms applicable to the transaction(s) (including but not limited to tax terms and governing law).
==========
f. Purchases from Channel Partners.
Customer may procure use of any Services, Software, or Mobile Apps from a third-party authorized reseller of Freshworks, including third-party marketplaces (“Channel Partner”) pursuant to a separate agreement with the Channel Partner.
Customer’s use of any Services, Software, or Mobile Apps procured through a Channel Partner will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, and all fees payable (including applicable taxes) for such use will be payable to the Channel Partner pursuant to the terms agreed to between Customer and Channel Partner.
Customer understands and agrees that, if Customer purchased the Services, Software, or Mobile Apps subscriptions via a Channel Partner, service credits and refunds payable under this Agreement may be payable or applied by Channel Partner acting on behalf of Freshworks in proportion to the fees paid by Customer to the Channel Partner, and the discharge by the Channel Partner of such obligations will relieve Freshworks of the same under this Agreement.

==========
Freshworks will notify Customer of any such suspension.
Freshworks will use diligent efforts to attempt to limit, where commercially feasible, the suspension to affected Users or Freshworks Technology, and will immediately restore the availability of the same as soon as the issues leading to the suspension are resolved.
Such suspension will in no way affect Customer’s other obligations under this Agreement.
d. Termination for Cause.
Either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event that (i) such other party materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days of such notice, or (ii) immediately in the event the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.
==========

Upon the expiration of Customer’s free trial, Freshworks may immediately suspend Customer’s access to the Services.

==========
f. Data Export.
Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or any SOF for any reason, Customer’s access to the Services, Software, Mobile Apps, APIs and other Freshworks Technology will terminate.

Customer agrees, following the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an unrenewed Subscription Term, that Customer Data will be retained or deleted in accordance with the Supplemental Terms, as applicable to Customer.
Where Customer Data is retained by Freshworks and can be exported, and provided that Customer is current on its payment obligations as described in Section 5, Customer may contact Freshworks within fourteen (14) days following the effective date of termination to have Freshworks export Customer’s Customer Data.
Customer Data cannot be recovered once it is deleted.
7.
==========
Confidentiality.
Each party will protect the other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as it protects its own Confidential Information of similar nature or importance, and in any event, using no less than reasonable care.
Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, the receiving party may use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, and will disclose such Confidential Information solely to those of its respective employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound by obligations to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information.
The provisions of this section will supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between the parties entered into prior to this Agreement that would purport to address the confidentiality of any information shared by the parties, including Customer Data, and such agreement will have no further force or effect with respect to the foregoing.
==========
If the receiving party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party, then the receiving party will, to the extent legally permitted, provide the disclosing party with advance written notification and cooperate in any effort to obtain confidential treatment of the Confidential Information.
The receiving party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the receiving party, the disclosing party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
