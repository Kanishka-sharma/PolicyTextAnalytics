Risk and Liability 
 
3.1.
Risk Statement
 
You
understand that you are using our services at your own risk.
It for this reason that we condition the use of our
services to those who can actually bear the loss of any money invested and who
properly  understand the associated risks
that are inherent to the Forex market.
==========
It is also
important to have relevant experience when entering financial contracts and
transactions.
As you know, the Forex market is a
dynamic arena and foreign currency prices are often highly unpredictable and
volatile.
==========
As such, any investment on our website can never be considered a safe
investment rather only an investment with risk of loss inherently associated
with it.
Furthermore, our own spread is added to existing calculations and
online quotes which makes a trade on our website even more volatile.
We make
sure that the maximum risk associated for any user shall not exceed the actual
amount of money paid to us and deposited in your account.
3.2.

cover the entire cost, whether indirect or direct, of the transaction.
In the
unlikely event that a contract is entered to acquire or sell currency at a
price that does not reflect the market price (such as an event where a
technical error such as a bug or defect has caused a malfunction that has
effected the price of the transaction), we reserve our right to terminate and
cancel any such transaction.

==========
We strictly state that
we do not permit the use of our Services by users from jurisdiction in which
the use of our Services is not permitted.
This Agreement is not offering or
soliciting the use of our Services to any one located in a jurisdiction in
which the specific use is not authorized or otherwise permitted by local laws.
Please note that Granola shall apply its own spread to all
transactions and trades made by using our Services which can increase the cost
of the transactions and trades accordingly.
==========
By using our Services, you declare that all the funds that
you use and invest on our Service do not originate in any way from drug
trafficking, abduction, terrorist activity or any other criminal activity that
is unlawful or could be considered unlawful by any authority.
In the event that
we become suspicious that you may be engaging in or have engaged in fraudulent,
unlawful or improper activity, including, without limitation, money laundering
activities, or conduct otherwise in violation of this Agreement, your access to
the Service may be terminated immediately and/or your account blocked.

relevant authorities, other online service providers and banks, credit card

3.5.
==========
Taxation
 
You hereby
acknowledge and understand that we do not collect any taxes for any government
authority in any form or manner and you further understand that it is your own
responsibility to calculate and pay all applicable taxes applicable in your
country of residence arising as a result of your trading activity on our
Services.
Notwithstanding the above and without derogating in any way from your
sole, exclusive and personal obligation to pay taxes in your local
jurisdiction, you unequivocally agree that we may deduct any taxes due under
applicable law and regulations that may arise from the results of your
investment on our system.
All amounts extracted from your account are
"gross amounts", from which we may deduct any such taxes if necessary
and under law.
In such an event, you shall have no claim towards the Company
with regard to any such deductions.
3.6.
Disclosures
 
3.6.1.
==========
It
is important that you be fully aware of the following points: 

Where being unable to collect
     such fee(s), Company reserves the right to close part, or all, of
     Customer’s open positions, in order to facilitate such charge.
Notwithstanding, Customer shall be liable for promptly paying such fee(s)
     to Company even if Customer has had full loss of all margins deposited by
     him.
==========
Granola does not guarantee any
     order.
Placing stops, regardless of the entry or closing designation, does
     not guarantee the trade will be filled at the order price.
All Entry
     Stops and Stops will be filled, upon activation, at the first/best
     available market price that may or may not match the requested order
     price.
The high level of leverage
     effect possible in conducting foreign currency transactions stems from the
     fact that it is only necessary to pay relatively modest margins or
     guarantees in relation to the scope of the contract.
==========
The result of the above is that
     even a slight fluctuation of the market could mean substantial gains when
     these fluctuations are in your favor, but that could also mean
     considerable losses if the fluctuations are to your detriment.
No system exists that could
     assure you that transactions on the foreign currency market should bring
     you great benefits, nor is it possible to guarantee, that your transactions
     will yield favorable results.
Even though the foreign
     currency markets are liquid as compared with other financial and exchange
     markets, the market conditions might at times render the execution of an
     order or of a limit order at a stipulated price impossible.
==========
The amount you could lose in a
     transaction carrying limited risk will never be more appreciable than that
     which you can lose in transactions having no pre-determined limit on loss.
Nevertheless, even though the
     extent of the losses could be subjected to an agreed upon limit, the risk
     of incurring losses could be higher, and that loss could occur in a
     relatively short period of time.
==========
Since deposit of an additional
     guarantee is not obligatory in this case, Granola reserves the right to
     close the outstanding balances without the customer's consent.
The risk information presented
     here does not reflect all of the risks as well as other important aspects
     intrinsic to the Forex market.
Therefore, before
     starting to trade, you should learn the specifics of trading on forex markets in detail.
