==========
SECTION 6: THIRD PARTY APPS
Cloudflare’s Service allows you to install or utilize certain third party apps (“Apps”).
These Apps are provided “AS IS” and governed by their own terms of service and privacy policies as set forth by the third parties that provide them.
Cloudflare does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the services or features provided by these Apps you choose to install.
You acknowledge and agree that Cloudflare shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly,
                for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any Apps.
==========
SECTION 7: YOUR CONTENT
You retain full copyrights in any materials served through Cloudflare.
Depending on the features you select or Apps you enable, Cloudflare may modify the content of your site.
For example, Cloudflare may detect any email addresses and replace
                them with a script in order to keep it from being harvested, or Cloudflare may insert code to improve page load performance or enable a Third Party App.
Depending on the features you enable, you acknowledge Cloudflare may:

Intercept requests determined to be threats and present them with a challenge page.
==========
Add cookies to your domain to track visitors, such as those who have successfully passed the CAPTCHA on a challenge page.
Add script to your pages to, for example, add services, Apps, or perform additional performance tracking.
Other changes to increase performance or security of your website.
==========
Cloudflare will make it clear whenever a feature will modify your content and, whenever possible, provide you a mechanism to allow you to disable the feature.
As a visitor to Cloudflare.com and a user of the Cloudflare Service, you consent to having your Internet Protocol address recorded and your activities monitored to prevent abuse.
SECTION 9: RECORDS OF YOUR VISITORS
As part of the Cloudflare Service, you may choose to monitor the traffic to certain websites.
==========
In doing so, you acknowledge that Cloudflare acts as your limited agent (and data processor in the EU context) to you for the purpose of providing
                Internet data and optimization services.
You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that the use of Cloudflare’s Service is permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction and you agree to indemnify and hold Cloudflare harmless
                if your use of the Service is in violation of local law.
Where required by law, you agree to post a privacy policy on any that, at a minimum, discloses any and all uses of personal information that you collect from users including any
                information collected via the Service.
You agree to indemnify and defend Cloudflare from and against any and all claims stemming from your failure to comply with this provision and/or your failure or refusal to abide by the terms and provisions
                of any applicable privacy policies.
==========
You acknowledge that Cloudflare may use this data to improve its service or enable other services (e.g., using visitor traffic logs or data posted through the service to detect threats so as to stop
                future attacks).
SECTION 10: LIMITATION ON NON-HTML CACHING
You acknowledge that Cloudflare’s Service is offered as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites and is not offered for other purposes, such as remote storage.
Accordingly, you understand and agree to use the Service solely for
                the purpose of hosting and serving web pages as viewed through a web browser or other application and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) protocol or other equivalent technology.
==========
Cloudflare’s Service is also a shared web caching service,
                which means a number of customers’ websites are cached from the same server.
To ensure that Cloudflare’s Service is reliable and available for the greatest number of users, a customer’s usage cannot adversely affect the performance of
                other customers’ sites.
Additionally, the purpose of Cloudflare’s Service is to proxy web content, not store data.
Using an account primarily as an online storage space, including the storage or caching of a disproportionate percentage
                of pictures, movies, audio files, or other non-HTML content, is prohibited.
==========
You further agree that if, at Cloudflare’s sole discretion, you are deemed to have violated this section, or if Cloudflare, in its sole discretion, deems it necessary
                due to excessive burden or potential adverse impact on Cloudflare’s systems, potential adverse impact on other users, server processing power, server memory, abuse controls, or other reasons, Cloudflare may suspend or terminate your account
                without notice to or liability to you.
SECTION 11: INVESTIGATION
Cloudflare reserves the right to investigate you, your business, and/or your owners, officers, directors, managers, and other principals, your sites, and the materials comprising the sites at any time.
These investigations will be conducted
                solely for Cloudflare’s benefit, and not for your benefit or that of any third party.
If the investigation reveals any information, act, or omission, which in Cloudflare’s sole opinion, constitutes a violation of any local, state, federal,
                or foreign law or regulation, this Agreement, or is otherwise deemed harm the Service, Cloudflare may immediately shut down your access to the Service.
==========
You agree to waive any cause of action or claim you may have against Cloudflare for
                such action, including but not limited to any disruption to your website.
You acknowledge that Cloudflare may, at its own discretion, reveal the information about your web server to alleged copyright holders or other complaintants who
                have filed complaints with us.
SECTION 12: INDEMNITY
You agree to indemnify and hold Cloudflare, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use
                of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of the Terms of Service, or your violation of any rights of another.

                INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF CLOUDFLARE.COM, THE CLOUDFLARE SERVICE, OR DOWNLOADABLE
                SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
CLOUDFLARE MAKES REASONABLE EFFORTS, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT CLOUDFLARE.COM, THE CLOUDFLARE SERVICE, ANY DOWNLOADABLE SOFTWARE, THE CLOUDFLARE SERVERS, OR EMAIL SENT FROM ANY OF ITS DOMAINS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

==========
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cloudflare acknowledges that it is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and is a PCI DSS Level 1 certified organization.
As such Cloudflare is therefore
                responsible for the security of cardholder data that it transmits on behalf of its customers while that data is within Cloudflare’s network.
Cloudflare does not store cardholder data transmitted through its network at any point.
==========
SECTION 14: AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AND CANCELLATION
WHEN YOU REGISTER FOR THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (A) CLOUDFLARE (OR OUR THIRD PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) IS AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE YOU ON A MONTHLY BASIS FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE (IN ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE
                  TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE CONTINUES, AND (B) YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE IS CONTINUOUS UNTIL YOU CANCEL IT OR WE SUSPEND OR STOP PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE SERVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE
                  TERMS OF USE.
IN ORDER TO PREVENT AUTO-RENEWAL OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT DASHBOARD BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF YOUR NEXT MONTHLY BILLING PERIOD.
YOU WILL BE BILLED IN FULL FOR THE MONTHLY BILLING PERIOD
                  IN WHICH YOU CANCEL.

Cloudflare’s policy is to investigate violations of these Terms of Service and terminate repeat infringers.
You agree that Cloudflare may, under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate your Cloudflare account,

                  of your account, access to the Service, or any disruption to your services such a termination may cause.
You expressly agree that in the case of a termination for cause you will not have any opportunity to cure.

==========
SECTION 16: DMCA & ABUSE REPORTS
Cloudflare is a pass-through network and, at most, caches content for a limited period in order to improve network performance.
Cloudflare automatically removes content from our caches when it has been removed from our customer’s origin
                  web server.
Cloudflare is not a hosting provider and has no way of removing abusive content on third party hosting services.
Individuals or copyright holders concerned with content served through Cloudflare’s network may submit a complaint
                  for investigation to:
                  https://www.cloudflare.com/abuse.
Cloudflare does not accept abuse complaints submitted over the telephone.
If you would prefer not to use our complaint submission form, you may mail your complaint to:
Cloudflare, Inc.
Attn: Legal Department
                   101 Townsend St,
                   San Francisco, CA 94107
                  

Please provide detailed information supporting your complaint as well as an affidavit attesting to its validity.
By submitting a complaint, you acknowledge that, at Cloudflare’s sole discretion, copies of the complaint may be provided to the Cloudflare user, the user’s hosting provider, posted on Cloudflare’s website, and/or provided to third party
                  services such as
                  Lumen.

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Terms of Service, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
SECTION 21: WAIVER
The failure of Cloudflare to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction
                  to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 22: SEVERABILITY OF TERMS
If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision,

==========
Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be adjudicated in San Francisco County, California, USA.
SECTION 26: ARBITRATION
In the case of any disputes under this Agreement, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve their dispute informally, or by means of commercial mediation, without the necessity of a formal proceeding.
Any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot otherwise be resolved as provided above shall be resolved by arbitration conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration
                  rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitral tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator
                  mutually agreed by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement within thirty (30) calendar days from the first referral of the dispute to the AAA, designated by the AAA.
The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California,
                  U.S.A., unless the parties shall have agreed to another location within fifteen (15) calendar days from the first referral of the dispute to the AAA.
==========
The arbitral award shall be final and binding.
The parties waive any right to appeal
                  the arbitral award, to the extent a right to appeal may be lawfully waived.
Each party retains the right to seek judicial assistance: (i) to compel arbitration; (ii) to obtain interim measures of protection prior to or pending arbitration,
                  (iii) to seek injunctive relief in the courts of any jurisdiction as may be necessary and appropriate to protect the unauthorized disclosure of its proprietary or confidential information, and (iv) to enforce any decision of the arbitrator,
                  including the final award.
The arbitration proceedings contemplated by this Section shall be as confidential and private as permitted by law.
To that end, the parties shall not disclose the existence, content or results of any proceedings conducted in accordance
                  with this Section, and materials submitted in connection with such proceedings shall not be admissible in any other proceeding, provided, however, that this confidentiality provision shall not prevent a petition to vacate or enforce
                  an arbitral award, and shall not bar disclosures required by law.
