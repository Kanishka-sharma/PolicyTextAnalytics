Sharing Information
We may disclose information about you to the following types of third parties: service companies (companies that provide us services in order to process transactions, provide statements, maintain our website and provide customer service, including customer contact); affiliates (companies owned by Juniper's owner, Juniper Financial Corp.); non-financial companies (merchants who offer non-financial goods and services to our customers); partners (universities, colleges, charities, and financial institutions through which we market products); financial service providers (companies with which we partner to market financial products); and credit bureaus, collection agencies, law enforcement regulators and professionals such as lawyers and accountants.
Outlined below is the information shared with each type of third party and as appropriate, your options.
i. Juniper Financial Corporation and Affiliates
Juniper Financial Corp. is a Delaware bank holding company that owns Juniper Bank.
Both Juniper Financial Corp. and Juniper Bank are owned by Barclays PLC family of companies.
As stated in our Account Agreements and applications, we may share information with our affiliates (companies that are at least 50 percent owned by Juniper Financial Corp).
==========
The information sharing by affiliates may be related to one or more of four areas: servicing your Account; regulatory and legal compliance; fraud and loss protection; and/or furnishing information about offers of goods and services offered by our affiliates.
You may elect not to receive offers from our affiliates, and thereby prevent information from being shared for that purpose, by visiting us online at the web address listed on the back of your card or by calling our Customer Service Center at 302-255-8990.
For more information regarding your options regarding information sharing with our affiliates, see "Your Privacy Options" above.

==========
Sharing Information with Service Companies
In order to provide quality service and statements, both online and offline, we contract with service providers for essential roles in processing transactions and producing statements and providing customer service including contacting customers.
We may disclose some or all of the information we collect to these processors and service providers but only the information needed to provide the service.
Each of our service providers has entered into a contract with us that forbids them from using information provided by us for any purpose other than providing the service for our customers.
We take security precautions to monitor the use of the information and prevent the use of the information for any other purpose.
iii.
Information Sharing With Merchants
We do not share any information with unrelated merchants for the purpose of extending offers of goods and services without your consent.
==========
The manner and use of information varies according to the method used to deliver the offer.
Mail and email offers.
We may provide offers of goods and services to you by mail and email without sharing information with the merchants who provide these goods and services.
We do this by controlling the process by which the offers are extended.
For example, a merchant wants to make a discount offer to our Account holders.
==========
Based on our knowledge of our customers, we select the Account holders we believe will most likely be interested in the offer and arrange to have a service provider mail or email the offer to you under the same security precautions we use to send a monthly statement.
The only information we provide the mail or email service provider is your name and address.
Our contract with the service provider prohibits use of your name and address for any other purposes, and we take security precautions to monitor compliance.
==========
The merchant gets no information about you unless, and until, you respond to the offer.
For more information about consent to receive offers see "Your Privacy Options" above.
Phone offers.
We may provide offers of goods and services by telephone.
In doing so, we do not disclose any of your personal information to merchants on whose behalf we extend the offers of goods and services.
==========
To the extent we engage a service provider to assist us in extending the offer, the only information we will provide the service provider is your name, address, phone number, and an internal reference number.
We provide your name, address, and phone number to allow our service provider to contact you.
The internal reference number cannot be used to process a charge to your Account.
The internal reference number is used by the service provider to advise us that you have agreed to a transaction.
When you accept an offer, we use the internal reference number to match the transaction to your Account to allow the transaction to be processed without you giving your Account number over the phone.
This process provides two advantages: first, it minimizes the possibility of misuse of your Account by limiting those with access to your Account number; and second, you know that the offer is being extended by us and will include a generous return and refund policy to allow you to shop in confidence.
==========
We also take security precautions to monitor and prevent misuse of the information provided to the service provider.
For more information about your consent to receive offers see "Your Privacy Options" above.
iv.
==========
Information Sharing with Partners
We offer our products in conjunction with colleges, universities, charities, financial institutions and other businesses.
By joining through one of these endorsed relationships, you agree to the sharing of information with that partner.
These relationships are clearly stated in the Account application and by applying for these products you agree to the information sharing by us and the partner, which may include: your name, address, phone number, and email address.
To the extent a program includes a rewards program or other benefit based on Account usage, we will provide the partner with information necessary to manage the program, including, as an example and not a limitation, number of transactions and dollar amount of purchases, payments, and credits.
By applying for these products, you consent to sharing information necessary to support the particular program.
==========
v. Joint Marketing
From time to time, we may enter into marketing agreements with other financial institutions to jointly offer a product.
In these cases, we may share all information we collect about you to determine your eligibility for the products and to extend an offer to you.
This information sharing will be subject to the same contractual restrictions and security precautions used for sharing information with service providers and vendors.
Your options regarding these offers (and the sharing of information) are the same as those available for information sharing with one of our affiliates.
vi.
==========
Credit Reports and Other Uses of Information
In applying for an Account, you agree that we may request consumer credit reports from one or more credit reporting agencies in connection with your application and after the opening of your Account, the administration of your Account.
You also authorize us to exchange credit information concerning you or your use of the Account with (and answer questions and requests from) others, such as merchants, other lenders, and credit reporting agencies.
We also share information with collection agencies, lawyers, accountants, auditors, bank regulators, and law enforcement as may be necessary in the administration of your Account or to respond to a legal inquiry or subpoena.
==========
Minors
We do not knowingly offer products and services to minors.
Similarly, we do not collect information about children, except to identify beneficiaries.
Our application approval process is designed to identify applications submitted by children and to prevent their opening an Account.
We may offer Uniform Gifts to Minor Accounts which typically include the name of the minor but may only be opened with an adult signatory on the Account.
Access to Account Information and Correction of Errors
You have the right to access your Account details and transaction information, including your application.
==========
Up to sixteen months of statements are available on the customer service website.
If you have a question or believe there is an error on your Account, write, log in to send us an email via our secure website, or call us as soon as possible so as not to lose any rights.
When contacting us be sure to include your name and Account number (if corresponding through a secure channel), along with a description of the error including the dollar value.
==========
Questions
We are committed to customer service and privacy.
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy and its implementation, please do not hesitate to email us at privacy@juniper.com, or call us at 302-255-8990.
