Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Quizlet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Quizlet’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Quizlet’s visitors use its website.
From time to time, Quizlet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
==========
Quizlet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
Quizlet does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Quizlet's website choose to interact with Quizlet in ways that require Quizlet to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Quizlet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Quizlet to provide a username, date of birth, and email address.
Those who engage in financial transactions with Quizlet are asked to provide additional information, such as name and credit card number.
==========
In each case, Quizlet collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Quizlet.
Quizlet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
==========
Children
For children under 13, Quizlet offers a limited feature set and web site experience.
We require consent from a parent when children under the age of 13 want to register on Quizlet and offer a limited version of the website that removes certain social features.
The only identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is a parent’s email address.
==========
Safety on Quizlet
Children’s safety and full enjoyment of Quizlet, as well as the safety and well being for all children and their families, is of the utmost importance to all of us at Quizlet.

We only keep an email on file for notifying parents of their child's wish to join Quizlet.

==========
