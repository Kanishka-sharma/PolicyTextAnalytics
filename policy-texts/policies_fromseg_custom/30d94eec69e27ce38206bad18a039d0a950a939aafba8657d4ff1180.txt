JW Player Privacy Policy
JW Player (LongTail Ad Solutions, Inc., LongTail, JW Player, Company, we, our or us) is an online video software company.
Our primary offerings are a video player and a video content management system (collectively, the technology Platform).
Our products and services (the Services) enable websites to embed video, stream and host videos and deliver advertising across the web.
The Company primarily serves three groups: those who surf the web (Users), those who provide video and other types of content (Publishers) and those who advertise their products and services (Advertisers).
Publishers place our products on their websites so Users may view videos.
In some cases, Advertisers place advertising messages via our products and services via third-party ad servers.
We help the Publishers understand how videos are being viewed on their websites.
We also help Advertisers understand which of their ads were viewed so they can better understand which ads are more effective.
==========
This privacy policy (Policy) explains how information is collected and used pursuant to offering our Platform and Services.
This Policy also explains how information is collected and used in connection with our corporate website located at https://www.jwplayer.com (the Website) as well as how information is collected directly from Publishers and Advertisers who use our Platform and Services.
By using or accessing the Platform or the Website, You acknowledge and accept the practices described in this Policy.
==========
We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time.
Your continued use of the Website or Platform constitutes your acceptance of the Policy then in effect.
For this reason, you should review the Policy from time to time to ensure that you understand and are willing to accept our current privacy practices.

Privacy Practices for our Technology Platform
We offer Publishers the Platform to upload videos, manage video content and gain insight into how Users watch video within our easy to use online dashboard.
Our Platform tools collect certain non-personally identifiable information from User interactions with the videos Publishers upload via our Platform tools.
This information includes: the User’s IP address, browser type, Internet Service Provider, computer (or mobile device’s) operating system and mobile device identifiers.
We also collect the URL of the page where our Platform tools are enabled, the referring URL, the version of the video player the Publisher is utilizing, when and how long the video was played, which advertising message(s) were inserted into the video, whether the video was played in full screen mode, and certain meta data about the video or the Publisher’s web page.
We use this information in a number of ways, including: a) to help us ensure that the web content is deploying accurately, b) to help us, our Publishers and our Advertisers understand how the web content and advertising we deploy is being viewed by Users, and c) to help ensure that the advertising and videos are both appropriate and relevant to User interests.

Like many video technologies, we may use Flash and similar technologies to enable our video players.

Privacy Practices for our Website
Our website (the Website) is directed primarily to Publishers and Advertisers, not Users.

We enable third-party advertisers to use their advertising and tracking cookies to collect information about your visits to the Website and also collect information about your visits to other websites in order to help deliver more relevant advertising messages to you and other consumers.
This process is sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising or interest based advertising.
And where these third-party advertisers are able to infer that a particular computer and mobile device belong to the same user or household, they may extend their advertising campaigns across those devices.
This process is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.
