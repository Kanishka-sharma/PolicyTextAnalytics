privacy policy


This statement only addresses our practices associated with the  website.
Other websites we operate may be subject to other practices.
You have rights under California Civil Code §1798.83 to learn more about our disclosure of your personal data; to exercise those rights, contact privacy@nextdoor.com.
The effective date of this statement is October 15, 2010.
==========
Data You Provide Us.
You can provide data to us in a variety of ways.
For example, you can submit content such as posts, events, and photos, comment on content from other members, RSVP to events, maintain a personal profile with information about yourself, and send messages to other members.
Registration Data.
When you register, you provide us with some personal data (including your email address).
Third parties may also provide us with your registration data.
After you register, you can tell us more about yourself through your profile page or elsewhere, and we may give you choices about who you would like to see this data.
We use registration data for many purposes, including to improve the site, generate reports of aggregated activity that we may share with others, target ads to you and send emails to you.
Typically, you can turn our emails on and off, but some administrative emails (such as emails about policy changes) are mandatory.
Directory Data Provided by Third Parties.
A third party, such as as neighborhood association or homeowners' association, may have provided basic directory information for you, such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
You can change or remove this information by editing your profile page.
==========
Content and Ratings.
Our site allows you to publish content.
We may publish some or all of your public member information with your content.
We may publish your ratings, and use the ratings to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, and identify/highlight popular members or submissions.
==========
Interest in Third Party Offerings.
You may have opportunities to express interest in, or register for, third parties’ offerings.
If you do, we will follow your instructions about providing your data to the third party (and we might retain the data as well).
Surveys.
We treat your survey responses like we treat our other business records.
==========
Accessing Your Records.
The information described in California Business & Professions Code Sec.
1798.83 is available by submitting the required information to privacy@nextdoor.com.
Data We Collect Automatically.
==========
As part of our servers’ normal operations, we log your IP address and referring/destination URLs.
We use this data, as well as other server usage data, to analyze site and user behavior, improve the site, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints and generate reports of aggregated activity that we may share with others.
If you contribute content to the site, we may republish your IP address and location.
==========
We use cookies.
To use the site, you need to accept our cookies.
We and our third party vendors (such as our web analytics service provider) may use cookies and web beacons to analyze site usage, improve the site, target ads, store your preferences, personalize your experience (including tracking your site usage to do so) and generate reports of aggregated activity that we may share with others.
==========
Other Data Collection.
We may get data from or about you in other ways not specifically described in this statement.
For example, you might contact Customer Service, or we may get a third party complaint about you.
We handle this data like our other business records.
Data Changes.
To the extent you or third parties modify or delete your data or content, we usually update our live databases immediately, but some data may update more slowly, and some old data and content may remain indefinitely in our archives and records.
==========
Contractors/Service Providers.
Third party contractors may have access to our databases.
Usually these contractors sign a standard confidentiality agreement.
Some of our site’s functionality may be operated by third party service providers, and in the course of providing this functionality, these service providers may obtain some of your personal data from you directly or transferred from us to facilitate your usage of this service.
Usually we require these providers to use and disclose your personal data only as necessary to perform their services.
Third party ad servers may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data from your visits to this and other websites to serve ads to you.
==========
Our “Corporate Family.”
We may share your data with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, other entities under a common control or third party acquirers.
We expect these other entities will honor this statement.
Also, we may allow a potential acquirer or merger partner to review our databases, although we would restrict their use and disclosure of this data during the diligence phase.
==========
Government Relations and Lawsuits.
You consent to us disclosing your data or data about you to the government if we are required to do so or if we think the disclosure is appropriate.
We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential legal proceedings (a) if we are required to do so, (b) if such disclosures might mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights.
==========
Communicating with Other Users.
Except as authorized by our robots.txt page, you may not use any automated means (such as a robot, spider, scraper or script) to access  or collect information from it.
Without limiting the foregoing, you may not collect (manually or in an automated manner) other users’ personal data (including email addresses) from the site.
==========
Children.
Unfortunately, our site is not designed for children 12 and under.
Do not submit any information about children 12 and under, and if you are 12 and under, do not use the site or provide any data to us.
==========
Limits on Our Abilities.
Our site is complicated, so we might inadvertently use or disclose your data in ways inconsistent with this statement.
For example, a temporary software glitch could lead to public display of your personal data despite your contrary preferences.
We might also make ad hoc uses of your data in ways not mentioned here.
In these anomalous situations, your sole remedy is that we will try to rectify the anomaly as soon as we can.
==========
Security.
We use industry-standard security protocols, such as (if and where we think appropriate) firewalls and restrictions on which employees can access user data.
However, perfect security does not exist on the Internet.
==========
Amendment.
We can amend this agreement either by emailing you about the amended terms, which take effect when we send you the email, or by displaying amended terms when you visit the  site, which take effect when we post them.
Otherwise, this agreement may be amended only by a writing physically signed by both us and you.
Our suppliers are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement, but no one else is.
