==========
Personally Identifiable Information: We collect information that can be used to identify you as an individual (“Personally Identifiable Information”) only when you provide such information directly to us in connection with the Service.
We ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and e-mail address when you register for a Disqus account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses).
If you purchase services or sign up for a paid subscription, then we will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.
We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.
We may receive Personally Identifiable Information about you from third parties, including, for example, information about your transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications.
For example, if you access our website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” linking your account to the Disqus service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Disqus.
This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, any information you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.
You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Disqus’ website or Service.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We also collect and use information about your interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does not identify you as an individual (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”).
We may collect, use, and disclose Non-Personally Identifiable Information as set forth below.

Cookies Information: Like many websites, when you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Disqus help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.
A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
==========
Analytics Information: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.
These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service.
We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
==========
Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.
When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information.
These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
