Protecting your privacy is very important to us.
We do not collect any
			  personally identifiable information (PII) about you during your visit to
			  NIH Web sites unless you choose to provide it to us.
We do, however, collect
			  some data about your visit to our Web site to help us better understand
			  how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful.
We collect
			  information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information

==========
When visitors send email messages containing personal information
              to the general NIH.gov email box NIHinfo@od.nih.gov, NIH staff
              responds to the letters and files them.
Only designated staff members
              requiring access to the emails to respond may view or answer them.
==========
Types of Information Collected
When you browse through any Web site, certain information about
              your visit can be collected.
We automatically collect and temporarily
              store the following type of information about your visit:

Domain from which you access the Internet
IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically
                assigned to a computer when surfing the Web)
Operating system and information about the browser used when
                visiting the site
Date and time of your visit
Pages you visited
Address of the Web site that connected you to an NIH Web site
                (such as google.com or bing.com)

We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our
              site and its various sections and to help make our site more useful
              to visitors.
How NIH Collects Information
NIH Web sites use a variety of different Web measurement software
              tools and specific information regarding information collection
              can be found on their respective Web sites.
NIH.gov uses Webtrends measurement software to collect the information
              in the bulleted list in the Types of Information Collected section
              above.
Webtrends collects information automatically and continuously.
No personally identifiable information is collected.
The NIH staff
              conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from Webtrends.
==========
The reports are only available to NIH.gov managers, members of
              the NIH.gov Communications and Web Teams, and other designated
              staff who require this information to perform their duties.
NIH also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback
              from a random sample of visitors.
NIH.gov uses the ForeSee Results’ American
              Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey to obtain feedback
              and data on visitors’ satisfaction with the NIH.gov Web site.
This survey does not collect personally identifiable information.
Although the survey invitation pops up for a random sample of visitors,
              it is optional.
==========
If you decline the survey, you will still have
              access to the identical information and resources at the NIH.gov
              site as those who do not take the survey.
The survey reports are
              available only to NIH.gov managers, members of the NIH.gov Communications
              and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information
              to perform their duties.
NIH retains the data from Webtrends and ACSI survey results as
              long as needed to support the mission of the NIH.gov Web site.

                cookies.
When you visit any Web site, its server may generate a piece of
              text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer.
The

              about your visit while you are connected.
The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages.
Cookies from NIH Web pages only collect information about your browser’s
visit to the site; they do not collect personal information about you.
==========
There are two types of cookies, single session (temporary) and multi-session

  Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1—Single
  Session."
The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single
  session web measurement and customization technologies."
==========
Persistent Cookies: We
  use persistent cookies to enable Webtrends to differentiate between new and
  returning NIH.gov visitors.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer between
  visits to NIH.gov until they expire.
We also use persistent cookies to block
  repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey.
The persistent cookies that block
  repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days.
