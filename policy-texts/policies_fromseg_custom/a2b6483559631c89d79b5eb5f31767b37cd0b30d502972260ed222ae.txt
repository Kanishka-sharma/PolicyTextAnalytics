These Cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made related to accessibility (e.g. text size, fonts) and customization.
They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video.

Activision may partner with third party online advertising and analytics companies to tailor and deliver advertisements, products, services, and promotions on Activision Properties, as well as other online properties which we do not control.
To help select the ads of greatest interest to you, these companies may use Cookies to collect and track information such as demographic data (e.g., gender, occupation, etc.), aggregated information, search keywords, geo-location, and device-related data (for example, browser type, language, IP address, advertising ID, time/date)to select advertisements that are more relevant to your interests and to better personalize the experience for you.
In some instances, third-parties may also use Cookies to collect anonymized or device-related information about your visits to Activision Properties in order to monitor the effectiveness of the ads (e.g., by using analytics Cookies) and to provide third party advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
Activision may use, combine and share anonymized or aggregated information obtained from Cookies with third parties such as vendors or advertising partners.
==========
For example, we may use information such as interests or gaming preferences to group you with other people with similar interests or preferences and place you into a market segment.
We may then display advertisements which we believe people in your market segment will find relevant.

We may also share personal and non-personal information obtained from Cookies with third parties such as vendors or advertising networks in order to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving advertisements for us or our advertising partners.

==========
From time to time, we may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our websites or other online properties or include them in the email messages we send you.
Web beacons (also known as "web bugs," "pixel tags," or "pixels") are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.
We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising, email auditing and reporting, and personalization.
==========
For example, we may use these in emails to understand and analyze whether the email was opened or any links were clicked, in order to improve our future communications with you and other users.
As a web beacon forms part of a webpage or email it does not have the same opt out options as other Cookies.
Generally, you can render them ineffective by opting out of any cookies they set, by turning off images in your email service, or by viewing your emails as “text” rather than “HTML.”
For more information on how to opt out of Cookies see the Managing Cookies section below, and for more information on how to turn off images in your emails or to view them as text see the “Help” section of your email service provider.
