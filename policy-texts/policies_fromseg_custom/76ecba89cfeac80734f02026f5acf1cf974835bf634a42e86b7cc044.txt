The Services We Provide at IgnitionOne
Behavioral Advertising Services.
We operate an online advertising service that helps advertisers customize, target and report on the advertisements we purchase on their behalf across third party websites and mobile applications.
While purchasing these ads across third party websites and mobile apps, we collect information about the sites that you and others may visit, and the searches that you and others may conduct while online in order to serve advertisements that we believe are more relevant to your interests.
Where we can reasonably infer that a particular computer and mobile device belong to the same user or household, we may extend our Behavioral Advertising Services and our advertising campaigns across those devices.
We also work with third-party data companies that help us tailor ads.
If you want to opt-out from having your information used for our Behavioral Advertising Services, please visit the section of this policy entitled “Opt-out Choice” located below.
==========
Optimization and Analytics Services.
We also provide many of our customers with Optimization and Analytics Service, which help those customers (which are generally brands and other companies seeking to advertise online) manage their digital advertising programs.
For example, we may help these businesses customize your experience when you visit their website, generate leads and manage their keyword search advertising programs.
Where we can reasonably infer that a particular computer and mobile device belong to the same user or household, we may extend our Optimization and Analytics Services and our advertising campaigns across those devices.
Because we undertake these activities on behalf of our customers, you should also consult our customers’ privacy policies to learn more about their practices.
==========
Data Management Platform Services.
We provide our customers with Data Management Platform Services via the IgnitionOne DMP, including email delivery and attribution, database management and mobile messaging services.
We store Personal Information such as name, email address and telephone number in the IgnitionOne DMP but ensure that any Personal Information from the DMP is appropriately safeguarded and segregated from data collected pursuant to our Behavioral Advertising Services as mandated by the NAI and other industry self-regulatory codes.
We follow the law and applicable industry self-regulatory codes with respect to processing data within the IgnitionOne DMP.
==========
In providing the Data Management Platform Services, IgnitionOne acts as a service provider for our customers and processes data under the specific instructions of those customers.
Our customers, not IgnitionOne, own the data stored in the IgnitionOne DMP.
As such, the use of the data contained in the IgnitionOne DMP is subject to the privacy policies of our customers.
If you want to opt-out from receiving certain marketing messages via the IgnitionOne DMP, please visit the section of this policy entitled “Opt-out Choice” located below.

The Information We Collect And How it is Used
Non-Personal Information is information that does not reveal your specific identity.
We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information from you in the course of providing the Services to our customers, including by placing cookies and using other tracking technologies such as “pixel tags,” “web beacons” or “clear GIFs.”
Where we serve ads into mobile applications, we may collect precise location information (e.g., lat/long) of your device and we may utilize the advertising ID offered by the mobile operating system providers.
Our Behavioral Advertising Services allow our advertisers to show you advertisements that are selected for you based on your past behavior on websites and mobile devices where we purchase advertisements on behalf of our customers.
When you use one of the third-party mobile applications or visit a web page on one of the third-party websites where we purchase ads, we will serve advertisements that are tailored to your interests based upon information stored in our systems.
We also collect data that allows us to infer that two devices (e.g., a laptop computer and a mobile phone) are likely to be part of the same household.
==========
We collect information such as the URLs you visit, your browser type, your operating system, the date and time of your request and the duration of your visit to each page, and certain commercially viable keywords pertaining to the searches you conduct.
As discussed above, when we provide Optimization and Analytics Services to our customers, we also collect information about your activities on our customers’ websites.
The data contained in the IgnitionOne DMP is subject to the privacy policies of our customers.
==========
We generally keep the information we collect pursuant to our Behavioral Advertising Services separate from the information we collect pursuant to our Optimization and Analytics Services.
IP Addresses.
We collect IP Addresses pursuant to the Services.
Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.
We use IP addresses for purposes such as guessing your geographic location, providing our customers with geographic-specific reporting, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.
Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files, computer IDs and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
Personal Information.
Is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and/or fax number.
==========
We do not collect Personal Information through the Behavioral Advertising Services and we do not merge or let our affiliates, customers or other third parties merge Personal Information with the Non Personal Information we use for our Behavioral Advertising Services.
We collect Personal Information as part of our Optimization and Analytics Services and our Data Management Platform Services.
For example, we may collect names, email addresses and postal addresses as part of an online lead generation campaign or an email marketing campaign on behalf of one of our customers.
We don’t make independent use of such data, we use that information only as directed by our client, and ensure that this information is appropriately safeguarded and segregated from data collected pursuant to our Behavioral Advertising Services.
