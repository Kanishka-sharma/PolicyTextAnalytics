What type of information is collected when a company uses Adobe's analytics and on-site personalization services?
When a company uses Adobe's analytics and on-site personalization services, that company tells Adobe what type of information it would like us to collect.

Examples of the type of information a company may ask Adobe to collect are:
The URLs of the web pages you visit and the time spent on them
The URL of the page that showed the link you clicked on that brought you to that company's website
The searches you have performed, including searches that led you to that company's website

Some companies may also buy additional information about you and then add that additional information to the information collected by Adobe's products on their websites.
This additional information may include things like email addresses, account information, or Facebook profile information, including photos and usernames.
When Adobe either is instructed to collect or receives personal information on behalf of companies that use our services, Adobe asks companies to describe within their privacy policies their information collection and use practices and give you the opportunity to opt out.

Adobe does not use the information we collect for a company except as may be allowed in a contract with that company.
This is usually limited to providing our services to the company.
However, an example of an additional use is when we share "aggregated" information collected from many companies with our customers, prospective customers, and partners in order to improve our products and services, to provide reports and market research, and to understand market trends.
Aggregated information is anonymous and does not identify individuals.
