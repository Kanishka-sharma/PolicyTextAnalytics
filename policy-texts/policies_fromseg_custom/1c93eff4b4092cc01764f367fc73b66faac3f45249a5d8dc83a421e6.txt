Terms of Service
Our main purpose at OZessay.com.au is to provide original research tailored to your academic level and specific subject, to be used at your own discretion.
We do not have any agreements with any agencies or institutions; we are not affiliated with any other custom writing services or databases, nor do we run other websites offering the same services or store information in a database of our own.
==========
The only information we do collect is about the computer being used, to protect us in the event of a fraudulent customer.
Please see our privacy policy for more information.
We have a very strict no-tolerance policy against plagiarism.
==========
Our writers send out papers based solely on the research and information gathered for the specific topic to which they were assigned.
Considering the time it takes to produce a quality paper reworked from one freely available or cheaply made, their time is better spent starting from scratch: it isn't worth the risk to them of getting caught and getting fired.
As a final, perhaps redundant, precaution, we do check the final draft against the latest version of anti-plagiarism software.
You shall be entitled to unlimited revisions during the first 20 (twenty) days from the date when your paper has been uploaded.
==========
If, however, you find proof of severe plagiarism, we do provide a full money back guarantee.
For your part, you agree to provide us with the full and complete information regarding your assignment.
If, for instance, you opt for a less expensive academic level and do not pass the assignment, we cannot be held accountable.
You hereby also agree that all necessary claims regarding revision of assignment, and/or any possible problems related hereto shall not be made after the 20 day revision period.
Papers written at a language level too elevated or a subject too sophisticated raises suspicions concerning its authenticity, and are subject to a failing grade along with papers not written well enough.
==========
If your order is not completed on time you can request a partial refund or credit towards new orders.
Late orders qualify for a full refund if and only if caused by obvious and numerous faults on the part of the writer: non-delivery of assignments, failure to find a writer for your paper and/or upon customer's request (before the paper has been completed and uploaded).
All other cases qualify exceptionally for a partial refund.
==========
Our academic advisers will review any such situation.
To avoid the above issues, our order page contains code that automatically controls how many pages per day can be written, based on academic level.
The papers we write are to be used as an example on how to do your own work.
If you use our paper to write your own, it should be referenced accordingly.
==========
We do not store your credit card information, but please be aware that we reserve the right to contact you or the cardholder by the phone number specified on the order form for anti-fraud verification.
We will represent ourselves as Academic Resources, a learning materials store, for your protection.
Any charges to your credit card will appear as "STUDENT CENTER".
Fraudulent transactions will be reported to the FBI.
