We also use aggregated information about the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences, improve our programming, and facilitate third-party reporting of internet usage.
Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection.

Netscape and its advertisers may also use cookies to determine which advertisements users have seen and how users responded to them, but don't use such cookies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so.

These ad network providers use cookies, Web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience.
The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, and you can find out more about ad network providers and the choices you have about these technologies by clicking here.
