Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California residents have the right to opt-out of the “Sale” of their personal information.
The CCPA defines the term “Sale” broadly, and includes, the selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise communicating (collectively a “Sale”) of personal information to another business or third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.
To submit an opt-out online, please visit our CCPA Request Web Portal.
