Information Collected With Cookies.
Like most websites, we also use cookies on certain pages of our Site.
Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you.
For example, a cookie lets our Site remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities on our Site, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently while visiting our Site.
We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests.
==========
Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site.
If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as it would be if the cookie were enabled.

The information that we collect with cookies allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze usage of our Site, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site’s content, layout and services.
However, we only use information collected with cookies on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you.

==========
What security measures do we employ for the Site?
To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through the Site, where personally identifiable information is requested, we use technology designed to encrypt the information that you input before it is sent to us.
In addition, we take commercially reasonable steps to protect data that we collect through the Site against unauthorized access.
