==========
Weblogs.
Web logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which may include email addresses you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP address.
If you are not a registered user of an AtomShockwave Site or if you have elected to Opt-Out of receiving email from us, we will not use the information from web logs to market to you.

Who does AtomShockwave share information with?
==========
We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have "opted-in" to such sharing.
If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this Privacy Policy.
As stated, and whether or not you have opted-in, AtomShockwave may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and such third parties may get access to your personal information for the purposes of providing services or products to you on AtomShockwave's behalf.
In addition, if you Opt-Out, as discussed below, we may share that information with third parties who send emails on our behalf so that they do not email you.
However, AtomShockwave may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on AtomShockwave; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of AtomShockwave; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.
==========
We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from time to time.
We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission.

When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.
In the event that AtomShockwave is acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
What are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable information?
==========
If you provide us with your e-mail address, and do not opt-out of receiving e-mail from us, we may e-mail you with information from AtomShockwave, including information about selected third parties.
If you do not want to receive information from AtomShockwave, you may decline to receive it (or "Opt-Out") either when you provide personal information to AtomShockwave or you may sign in and update your profile (or complete our E-mail form at http://www.atomshockwave.com/asw_contact_submission.htm).
