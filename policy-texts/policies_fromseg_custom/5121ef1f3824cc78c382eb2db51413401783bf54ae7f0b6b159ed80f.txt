To collect this information described above, we and our service providers may use cookies, which are small text files that online services often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their sites.

For example, these technologies may collect information about the web pages you visit, the content you view, when and for how long you interact with certain features, and whether you respond to advertisements.
We may use these technologies to identify your computer or device (which can help us or our service providers recognize you when you return), store information about your preferences (e.g., preferred language), log your interactions (e.g., the types of messages you prefer to receive), and present you with more relevant interest-based advertisements.
We retain this information in a form that can identify your computer or device for up to 24 months.
