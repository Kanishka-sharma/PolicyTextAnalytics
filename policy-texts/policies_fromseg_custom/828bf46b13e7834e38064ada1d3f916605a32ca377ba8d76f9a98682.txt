Privacy Statement

The Motley Fool is committed to protecting your privacy.
We want your visits to our site to result in peace of mind and long-term financial freedom, not spam e-mail from shady folks peddling miracle herbs.
So we want to inform you about what we're doing and why.
==========
The Motley Fool gathers information about you in two ways: (1) voluntary submissions and (2) cookies.
Voluntary submissions that you provide help us develop the types of features and content that will benefit you the most.
If we see a flood of newly registered Fools that is college-aged or nearing retirement, we can quickly beef up our paying-off-your-student-loan section or our in-depth coverage of real estate in Turks and Caicos.
==========
Similarly, cookies help us understand what pages or features are working and which ones miss the mark.
They help us figure out whether our site is working the way we intended, and whether the site is as easy to navigate as possible.
==========
We don't want to lose Fools in the recesses of our site and have to send out search parties to find them.
The folks here at Fool HQ have more ideas for this site than Houdini had rabbits.
==========
* Both the voluntary data and the cookies just help us focus our efforts.
You wouldn't want us focusing all of our time on the potential devaluation of the Drachma, would you?
==========
Now what about advertisers?
Many sites let you wander to a few areas for free, but if you want to use the really good stuff you must pay subscription fees.
==========
We don't think that's very Foolish.
We'd prefer to enlist the support of advertisers and keep our site 100% Grade-A FREE.
==========
However, we will not release any individual information to any advertiser.
No matter how hard they beg and plead, advertisers will only have aggregate information.
We will never give any advertiser any personal information about you without your permission.
Not your name; not your e-mail address.
Nothing.
==========
(Unless the law tells us we have to).
If you place an order in FoolMart, our online store, we will collect personal information including your credit card number and shipping information.
This information is necessary to fulfill your order and we will not share your specific, individual information with anyone outside The Motley Fool.
(again, except when we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so, or to protect our rights or property).
FoolMart customers may occasionally receive from us such materials as new catalogs and other information.
==========
On occasion we may e-mail you about an event or new feature that we think might be of interest.
Perhaps we've added a major new piece of content.
==========
Perhaps David and Tom are appearing on the Letterman show and Dave has front row seats for Fools.
Of course, if you do not wish to receive such e-mails, all you ever have to do is to hit the reply button and type "remove."
But, we'd like to keep you in the loop.
We think this is an important part of making your time at The Motley Fool as amusing, educational, and enriching as possible.
If you have any questions about this statement, please drop a note to PrivacyPete@fool.com
* One attentive reader points out that Houdini didn't do rabbits.
He did card manipulation and escapes.
