INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
Information You Provide  Evidon may ask you to provide us with personal information if you would like to take advantage of the services we offer.
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, company name, telephone number, and email address.
We use this information to respond to your requests and otherwise provide you with information regarding our products and services.

From time to time we will send you general marketing emails, notifications of events, and other important news about Evidon.
If you wish to learn how to opt out from receiving these types of email communications, please see the "Choice/Opt-out" section below.
==========
Website Tracking  We track the use of the Website to analyze our marketing efforts, improve the services we offer and improve the efficiency of the Website.
We automatically collect user traffic patterns throughout the Website using cookies, which do not contain personal information.
As this collection is for business purposes, we do not cookie users within our Consumers and Privacy section (though our site’s privacy notice, which can be accessed by clicking the “cookie consent” icon in the lower-right hand part of any page, will still include the same disclosures in this section as those included in our business-oriented sections).
Users who do not wish to have their data collected can opt-out of that collection via our site’s privacy notice.
Third Party Cookies  Except for those cookies disclosed in this Privacy Statement, Evidon does not allow third party cookies on the Website.
However, we may use third party providers to power certain services like the Evidon blog (located at http://blog.evidon.com).
Those third party providers may use third party cookies, for example session ID cookies, to make it easier for you to navigate the Website.
The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Statement.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)  Third party providers who service our website, like the Evidon blog, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help them better manage content on our site.
Clear Gifs are not cookies.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
==========
Evidon does not connect the information gathered by clear gifs to any user’s personal information.
Blog  Except for the information you have provided to us in order to subscribe to our blog, we do not collect any personal information in relation to our blog.
To request removal of your personal information that you gave us in order to subscribe to our blog, please contact us at privacy@evidon.com.

Before we post a customer testimonial on the Website, we obtain the customer's written consent to post the customer’s testimonial and name.

==========
In some cases we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
User Access  We provide you with reasonable access to your personal information to correct data that may be inaccurate or delete data at your request.
Please contact us at privacy@evidon.com if you would like to notify us of inaccurate data or request that we delete your data.
==========

Data Retention  We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at privacy@evidon.com.

In all such cases we use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the relevant Principles.
==========
However, even though Evidon does not otherwise share personal information about Website users with third parties, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.
Merger, Sale, or Reorganization of Evidon  If Evidon should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merged with another entity, information Evidon receives from you from this Website is an Evidon asset and may be transferred without recourse.
Affiliated Websites, Other Websites, and Advertisements  This Privacy Statement applies to the Website and describes our corporate information collection practices for our business operations.
It does not govern nor describe the information practices of our Evidon services for the online market.
We do not exercise control over the websites of third parties that you may link to or view as part of a frame on a page on this website.
We are not responsible for the actions and policies of such third parties.

If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the U.S., which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU.
However, our adherence to and compliance with the Safe Harbor Programs is the mechanism for us to the collect and transfer personal information from the E.U. to the U.S.

==========
Security  No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and therefore you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure that physical, administrative and technical safeguards are in place to protect the security of our systems and data we collect.
==========
However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such measures.
If Evidon learns of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
By using the Website or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Website.
Evidon may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.
Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@evidon.com.
Evidon may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs.
==========
Changes and Updates  We may occasionally update this Privacy Statement.
When we do, we will also revise the "Effective Date" at the top of the Privacy Statement.
For changes to this Privacy Statement that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will notify you here or by means of notice on our home page or by obtaining consent via email.
