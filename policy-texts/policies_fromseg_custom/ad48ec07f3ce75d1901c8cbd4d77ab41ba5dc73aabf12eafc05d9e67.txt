Dear Lycos Europe Network user,
		The lack of data protection on the Internet is a subject which worries a lot of people.
The Lycos Europe Network treats your data protection with the highest regard.
==========
On the one hand we are dependent on having to know a few things about you.
We want to offer our members the best service on the web and to do this we need to tailor it to your requirements.
On the other hand reciprocal trust is the foundation for any coexistence, even a virtual one.
==========
For this reason we'd like to explain briefly what we do with your data - and more importantly what we don't do.
We promise you: We will never pass on or sell your personal information to third parties.
Unless of course you have given your express agreement to do so.
==========
You will always be able to decide for yourself whether you receive information connected with advertising from us or not.
What we will do: We collect all member profiles which you create when registering and save them in a database.
This information helps us to set up your Lycos Europe Network membership according to your interests and preferences.
We only pass on information about our members in an anonymous and compressed form.
This enables us to inform advertising partners or journalists how many members we have, or that x percent of our members are women etc.
The Lycos Europe Network Team
