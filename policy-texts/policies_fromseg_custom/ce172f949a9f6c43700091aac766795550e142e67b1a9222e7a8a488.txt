SHANGYOUJIA TECHNOLOGY (HK) LIMITED (“AdView,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) provides this privacy policy to explain how we collect, use, and share information.
This privacy policy (“Policy”) covers AdView’s handling of two types of information:
1.
==========
Information we receive about end users (“End Users”) of third-party mobile applications (“apps”) that use our Software Development Kit (“SDK”), the AdView Ad Exchange (“AdView ADX”) (collectively, the “AdView Ad Services”), and
2.
Information we receive through our website at https://www.adview.com or any other website on which this Policy is posted, as well as information we get through other corporate services and web portals, we make available to clients and business partners (“AdView Websites”).
We describe the information received through the AdView Websites in Section 5 below, entitled “Privacy Practices for the AdView Websites.”
==========
We encourage consumers to learn about how information (including information we collect) can be used to market to them, and how to exercise their choices to permit or limit such marketing.
We describe ways consumers can exercise that choice or opt out of marketing in Section 4 below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
1.
==========
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
AdView provides mobile advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”), and service providers and other data partners (collectively “Partners”).
We do this by making available the AdView Ad Services and other tools to Clients.
Clients use the AdView Ad Services and other tools to deliver advertising to End Users, and we in turn provide our services to help Clients (and their own customers) to deliver ads that are of interest to End Users.
We explain what SDKs are in Section 3 below, entitled “Pixel Tags, and SDKs,”.
2.
==========
PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR THE ADVIEW AD SERVICES
a. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE ADVIEW AD SERVICES
Through the AdView Ad Services, we may (but do not necessarily, or always) collect a variety of information about End Users (whether through our SDK or through other partnerships and tools such as Client-facing APIs), including:
•      IP addresses, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information such as information about End Users’ operating system;
•      Precise geolocation information (generally an End User’s latitude and longitude data);
•      Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs (collectively, “Advertising IDs”).
These Advertising IDs may be associated with other information we collect through the AdView Ad Services, from third parties, or through any other services we offer;
•     Device type and other device information (e.g., whether you are using a smartphone or tablet, and related information);
•      Network provider;
•      Mobile browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, and Chrome);
We may combine and merge the various types of information collected from the AdView Ad Services, and may also enhance it (or permit our Clients to enhance it) with information collected from third parties.
We refer to all of the above information as the “Service Information.”
b.
==========
How We Use the Information Collected Through the AdView Ad Services
We use the Service Information to provide a variety of services to our Clients related to advertising and marketing, including services we may describe elsewhere on AdView Websites.
This includes use of the Service Information for purposes such as to:
•      Provide and improve the AdView Ad Services.
This includes, for example, providing customer, technical, and operational support for these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity, and resolving disputes and enforcing our terms and conditions and other rights we may have.
==========
This may also include analyzing, customizing, and improving the features of the AdView Ad Services;
•      Provide information and analytics to Clients about the use of app features provided through the AdView Ad Services, or help Clients create or enhance user profiles for marketing or analytics purposes;
•      Create inferences about End Users categorized into “Audience Segments” or to help Clients do so.
For example, if the information we collect indicates that an End User likes apps (or clicks on ads) about travel, we may categorize the End User of that device as someone who is interested in travel;
•      Develop and use data models that try to predict End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis or across devices;
•      Analyze ad performance, for example, by attributing End Users’ app installations or mobile web visits to ad campaigns;
•      Combine the Service Information to perform (including by working with Clients and Partners) any of the above functions, or other advertising, marketing, or analytics services.
Or, we may aggregate and create data models to do this, by creating algorithms in order to predict common interests among End Users.
This may be done, for example, to target advertising or provide analytics to other parties.
c.
==========
How We Share Information We Collect Through the AdView Ad Services
Generally, we share the Service Information with Clients and Partners in order to provide the AdView Ad Services.
For example, we share the Service Information with:
•      Clients and their marketing and service providers, so they may provide targeted content and advertising to End Users on mobile apps;
•      Other third parties that target advertising.
This may include, for example, platforms that work directly with marketers (sometimes called demand-side platforms), analytics companies, data management platforms that help marketers maintain and use data, proximity solution providers, and other advertising technology providers.
These companies may, for example, provide targeted content and advertising to End Users and others on third-party mobile apps or other advertising media (such as email, direct mail, and display media);
•      Clients and their marketing and service providers, to help measure the effectiveness of marketing or analyze their End Users’ likely interests or demographics;
Even when you no longer access our SDK, we may continue to use and share your information as described in this Policy.
The processes we described above often involve cookies-similar technologies, which may be associated with other information about End Users, such as End Users’ interests, demographics, or transactions.
==========
This is generally known as “interest-based advertising.”
We encourage individuals who are interested in controlling or learning about this type of advertising to go to Section 4 below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options,” or go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) website at www.aboutads.info.
We may also share Service Information with third parties:
•      Pursuant to a request or authorization by an End User or Client;
•      If the disclosure is provided to: (a) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement; (b) enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements; or (c) protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity;
•      Where the information is aggregated or de-identified; and
•      As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence).
3.
==========
SDKs
a. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We, or our Clients or Partners, may use or work with mobile SDKs (including our own SDK(s), which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our AdView Ad Services and those using our AdView Ad Services.
The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
We may use this technology, for example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps based on information associated with your mobile device.
If you would like to opt out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 4 below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
Our Clients or Partners may use the above technologies (sometimes, in combination with each other or other data such as IP addresses or hashed or de-identified data files) to coordinate identifiers across platforms, browsers, or devices, in order to more efficiently analyze or target advertising.
4.
==========
CONSUMER CONTROL AND OPT-OUT OPTIONS
In most cases, consumers have control over whether or not they would like to receive relevant ads and marketing email from our Clients.
a. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising
You can opt out of many of the platforms and service providers we work with that support online interest-based advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info (or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are located in the European Union).
==========
This type of opt out is cookie-based, which means that if you replace or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again.
Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads; rather, the ads you see will be less customized to you.
b. Opting Out of Cross-App Advertising on Mobile Devices
You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of interest-based mobile advertising (also called “cross-app advertising”), including those performed by AdView, by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows:
•      Apple Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher and enabling “Limit Ad Tracking.”
o     iOS 7 and Higher: Go to Settings → Privacy → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
o     iOS 6: Go to Settings → General → About → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
•      Android Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by going to Google Settings → Ads, and selecting the option to opt out of interest-based ads.
==========
Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change.
Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described above, please check the settings for those devices.
==========
c. Additional Choices
Advertisers may also provide ways for you to opt out from, or limit their collection of, certain information from and about you.
Please refer to the privacy policies for retailers, apps, and mobile websites to learn more about their privacy practices.
==========
You may opt out from receiving promotional emails from us, such as emails to inform you about events and new services, by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any promotional email you receive, or by contacting us at privacy@adview.com.
Please note, however, that we may still send you non-promotional emails relating to your relationship with us.
