==========
How we collect data.
The data we collect depends on the services and features of our products that you use.
You provide some data directly, such as when you create an account, submit a search query, or contact us for support.
Our servers collect information known as “log data,” that includes your IP address, the time your computer or device visited the site, the URL of the Web site you arrived from, and the type of device or browser you used to access the site.
We also get information by recording how you use our services and whether you navigate between our services and others’.
For example, we use cookies (small text files placed on your device) and web beacons (small graphic images contained in a Web page or email).
4.
Access to data not collected directly by Whitepages.
Our users are able to access contact and background information from third parties to meet a number of needs, including fraud prevention, verifying identities and updating contact information.
Such data is not compiled by Whitepages and is instead provided by third parties.

==========
How and why we share data we collect.
We only share data with trusted vendors with whom we have a relationship to provide services you have requested or authorized.
For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with entities that process payment transactions, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.
==========
Similarly, if you request data available from a third party, we will pass along your request to enable them to provide you with the data.
We share data with vendors working on our behalf to provide customer service and analytics.
We may transfer data as part of a corporate transaction such as a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
==========
We may share data when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law, to respond to a legal process, such as a subpoena, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.
Under certain circumstances, applicable law may prohibit or require us to provide you with additional notice regarding sharing of data.
We may, unless legally required to provide you notice, disclose data in response to a subpoena without giving you notice.
Finally, we may provide access to non-personally identifiable information to our third-party advertisers so that they can deliver relevant online and mobile advertising to you.
7.
How we protect your data.
We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.
==========
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer/phone, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.
We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
8.

You may use your account to access, correct, or change any personal information that you have provided to us or that is associated with your account.

Browser settings may allow users to automatically transmit a “Do Not track” signal to web sites and online services, but there is no consensus on how “Do Not track” should be interpreted.
Whitepages currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not track” signal from a user’s browser.
We follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (about the collection and use of data for interest-based advertising) and expect third parties to comply with the disclosure and notification program specified by principles.
This means that third parties collecting and using this data are asked to provide a standard icon/link in or near their advertisements that will provide you with additional data about their privacy and advertising practices, as well as with the opportunity to directly opt-out of having your information collected.
