How We Use Your Personal Information
Connextra buys advertising space on websites and places ads for our customers to help them promote their services.
Adverts may encourage you to visit a customer’s website or return to a website you have visited.
When deciding whether to serve an advert to you, we consider:
Your device’s IP address or location (country) to check that the services we are advertising are legal in your region, and
Your cookie details to determine whether we have recently shown you an advert and whether you have visited the website of a customer for whom we are serving ads.
We may choose not to show you an advert if we have recently shown you a related advert, if you have already accessed the advertised service or if you or the advertiser has asked us not to show you adverts.
==========
If you have given consent for one of our customers to deliver personalised digital marketing messages to your device, we may show you adverts based on your betting activity or browsing history.
Your data may also be used to record advert serving impressions, record advert clicks, to analyse the effectiveness of a campaign and to report ad-serving activity and results to our customers.
==========

We may send your details to others to help run our organisation.
These are:

By using our third party providers we may transfer the personal information we collect about you to the USA, if this is necessary, in order to perform our contract with you, or in accordance with any legitimate interests of Betgenius.
Our third party providers, including MediaMath, Akamai Technologies and AppNexus, and our US entity (Genius Sports Media Inc) are registered with the US Privacy Shield.
This means that those organisations within the USA have been deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal information.
We also transfer your personal data to our employees in Medellin (Colombia).
==========
There is not an adequacy decision by the European Commission in respect of that country.
This means that Colombia is not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal information.
However, to ensure that your personal information does receive an adequate level of protection we are putting in place approved standard contractual clauses between us and our Colombian entity as an appropriate measure to ensure that your personal information is treated by our employees in Colombia in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection.

Connextra gathers and processes your personal data to deliver adverts to your device.

Consent – adverts that are based on your personal data and that use profiling or other personalisation techniques require your consent.
These adverts will not be shown to you unless you have given consent.
Legitimate interest – we may show adverts from campaigns based on the website you are visiting and the time you last saw an advert.
This processing, as well as reporting activities required to support the product, happens under legitimate interest.
