Credit/Debit Card Processing & Payments
Chegg may require users of the Services to provide a valid credit or debit card tied to an account at a financial institution when they register for an
	account (to ensure users are able to make applicable payments to Chegg) or upon ordering products or services.
If a payment card is required, you are
	responsible for ensuring that a valid credit or debit card is associated with your Chegg account at all times (either the original card or a replacement).
To confirm your card is valid, Chegg may initiate a "pending" charge for one dollar (US $1.00) on the account.
==========
This charge will not be confirmed and,
	therefore, you will not be charged and it will simply disappear from your financial statement (usually within seven days - check with your financial
	institution for additional information).
Please be aware that this $1.00 pending charge may be initiated each time you edit the card information for your
	account or place an order that cannot be processed.
Where your billing address is requested, you must provide the address and phone number your financial
	institution has on record, as well as the card's security code (e.g., CVC, CVV, CID).
Chegg will make reasonable efforts to process your transactions in a
	timely manner, but we make no guarantees regarding the processing time for charges.
==========
Chegg will store your credit or debit card information and you hereby
	acknowledge and agree that Chegg may charge you for, and you will pay for, any charges specified on the Services and for any auto-extension or unreturned,
	lost, stolen, or damaged books associated with your account under the terms of your book rental and in accordance with the General Policies.
For any books or other materials kept beyond the applicable rental term, you agree to be charged the applicable
	late fees as set out in our General Policies.For any books or other rental materials that are never
	returned (an item is deemed "never returned" if it has not been returned in the period posted in our General Polices) or that are returned damaged, you
	agree to be charged for the value of the item(s) as set out in our General Policies.
Chegg reserves the
	right to place you into collections if you fail to timely pay for the products and services ordered through the Services; collections may be done by Chegg
	or a third party on Chegg's behalf.
You also agree that we may, at our discretion, send your account to a collection agency, and recover our reasonable
	costs of collection from you, if you fail to pay all fees due and owing to Chegg.
For security reasons or to otherwise confirm a financial instrument or
	payment, Chegg may delay mailings of books or otherwise delay providing payments or services even if such delay impacts a guaranteed delivery date.
==========
Third Party Links, Content and Applications
There may be links from the Services, or from communications you receive from the Services, to third party web sites or online features.
The Services
	also may include third party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse.
Functionality on the Services may also permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or online feature, including applications
	that connect the Services or your profile on the Services with a third party site.
For example, the Services may include a button enabling you to indicate,
	on your social networking page, that you "like" a specific product on the Services, or a feature that lets you post to your social networking page a link
	to a specific product or the ability to share content from the Services or your User Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third
	party's web site.
==========
Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third party website, and you do so at your own risk.
We
	do not control any of these third party sites or any of their content.
Accordingly, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we are in no way responsible
	or liable for any of those third party sites or online features.

	INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PAYMENT AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND ANY TERMS, CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

==========
For certain schools, the Services enable you to search
	and retrieve information about the materials required for particular courses.
Please be aware that course information and assigned materials may change
	from time to time, and Chegg may not receive updated information from the school in a timely manner.
Chegg is not responsible for any errors in the
	information provided in the course searches on the Services.

	not imply any endorsement or approval by the school.

	institution, and school names and information are used on the Services only to the extent necessary to organize, identify and permit use of information and
	sections of the Services that may be tailored to students of a particular school, or for other lawful uses.

"Members" may include a variety of
	designated levels of members who may be charged for services according to the terms of the particular offer, or registered free members (a "Free Member"),
	or other membership levels.
"Visitors" are users that have not registered for an account with access to and use of certain aspects of the homework help
	services, which may be restricted and only available to certain Members.

The membership levels, the benefits and pricing of each level of membership may
	vary and are subject to change at any time, please read the terms of any particular level of membership carefully before accepting it.
Chegg may modify
	these levels and benefits from time to time, and each such modification is effective as soon as we post it on the relevant Services except to the extent

It is therefore important that
	you review the membership page regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes.

Overview: Points earned in the Program are called "Chegg Points."
You can earn Chegg Points by completing qualifying activities that enrich the student
    experience within the Chegg.com platform ("Chegg Platform").
Earned Chegg Points can be used to redeem rewards available in the Program redemption center.
For example, we may have gift cards and credit toward Chegg textbook rentals/purchases available for redemption.
==========
Earned Chegg Points can also be redeemed
    to engage in select activities on the Chegg Platform, such as asking questions to Chegg's community of experts.
It is your responsibility to review and verify that your Chegg Points total is accurate.
You can review your Chegg Points total on your "Points and Rewards
    History" account page.
Questions about your Chegg Points total may be
    directed to Chegg customer support.
You agree to comply with our reasonable requests for applicable proof of any errors or disputes in Chegg Point
    processing.
Chegg reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to verify information collected when you open your Chegg Platform account and to suspend your account and
    your ability to participate in the Program if Chegg suspects you of fraudulent activity, including, without limitation, signing up for multiple accounts.
You are responsible for keeping your account information current and accurate and Chegg is not responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information
    supplied.
==========
Earning Chegg Points and Qualifying Activities: 
Chegg Points may be earned for performing qualifying activities on the Chegg Platform, including answering questions on the Chegg Platform.
We will
    expressly state on the Chegg Platform when and how Chegg Points may be earned for a particular activity.
Any list of qualifying activities and the number
of Chegg Points that may be earned for performing qualifying activities will be posted within the Chegg Points Earning Activities Page and may be changed by us at any time and in our sole
    discretion.
In connection with answering questions on the Chegg Platform to earn Chegg Points, your answer may be rated by the asker or others, and the rating may
    impact the number of points you receive.
Further, if multiple answers are received for a question, only one answer will receive points for each question;
    answering a question, therefore, may not earn you points even if your answer is correct and even if it is rated highly.
The impact of a rating on the
    number of points, and the criteria for deciding which answer gets points, is posted on the Chegg Points Earning Activities Page, and may be changed at any time at Chegg's discretion.
You agree that Chegg is in
    no way liable for the actions of an asker, including, without limitation, any ratings assigned by an asker to any answers.
==========
Chegg Points are only for active users of the Chegg Platform.
Your earned Chegg Points will not expire so long as you use the Chegg site.
Should you fail
    to log into your Chegg account for a period of 24 months or more, Chegg may reduce your Chegg Points balance to zero.
Purchasing Subscription Plan Chegg Points
We may also choose to offer users the ability to purchase a subscription plan that includes a number of benefits on the Chegg Platform, including a
    periodic allotment of points that can only be used to ask questions of Chegg's community of experts on the Chegg Platform ("Subscription Plan Chegg
    Points").
==========
Subscription Plan Chegg Points are not earned Chegg Points and cannot be used to redeem rewards.
Your Subscription Plan and all associated
    benefits (including unused Subscription Plan Chegg Points) will terminate in accordance with the term applicable to your plan.
Subscribers may also be able
    to upgrade their subscription plans before they end to gain additional benefits, including a larger allotment ("Packs") of Subscription Plan Chegg Points.
No refunds are available for a subscription plan or such point Packs, but additional allotments or packs of Subscription Plan Chegg Points purchased by the
    user will not expire so long as you are active on the Chegg Platform.
If you fail to log into your Chegg account for a period of 24 months or more, Chegg
    will reduce your Subscription Plan Chegg Points and any associated packs or allotments of points to zero (0).
==========
Rewards and Redeeming Chegg Points
Participants may redeem earned Chegg Points for select products or enhanced services or toward purchases made on Chegg.com.
Chegg Points may be redeemed
    for the rewards set forth on the Chegg Points Rewards Page.
Chegg Points cannot be redeemed towards shipping or handling costs or tax.
You are solely responsible for all federal, state and local
    taxes and any other costs or expenses of accepting and using Chegg Points or rewards redeemed with your Chegg Points, unless Chegg specifically states
    otherwise in writing.
==========
Upon submitting a reward request, Chegg will review your account activity.
We reserve the right to deny a reward request if Chegg determines, in its sole
    discretion, that you have violated these Terms.
Rewards are available on a first-come, first-served and while-supplies-last basis.
Your Chegg Points total
    will be reduced by the number of redeemed Chegg Points, and the redemption is not reversible.
Rewards are provided "as is" with no warranty or guarantee,
    either express or implied by Chegg.
==========
Rewards will be e-mailed to your e-mail address or mailed to your U.S. postal address, as applicable, that you provided when you registered for the Program
    or last updated your Program account.
E-mailed rewards are typically sent within approximately ten (10) days from the date your order is processed, unless
    we state a different schedule or the particular reward you ordered is limited in quantity, backordered, or out of stock or you make a reward request during
    a high volume period such as major holidays.
Rewards shipped via postal mail will usually be shipped within approximately eight (8) to twelve (12) weeks
    from the date your order is processed, unless we state a different schedule or the particular reward you ordered is limited in quantity, backordered, or

==========
Chegg is not liable for any damages to, losses of or delays
    in any shipments.
Rewards that are undeliverable for whatever reason (including because your account information is incorrect) will not be re-sent and are
    forfeited, and the Chegg Points will not be refunded.

Chegg Points are not
    transferable and cannot be combined with other offers or with another person's Chegg Points.

    descendible, may not be inherited, bartered, purchased or sold to any third party.
Other exclusions and restrictions may apply.

Losing Chegg Points & Termination
Generally, earned Chegg Points do not expire as long as your Chegg Platform account is valid, active and in good standing as outlined herein.
However, in
    addition to the risk of losing your Chegg Platform account, you can lose or be denied Chegg Points by attempting to fix or transfer the earning or loss of
    any Chegg Points, violating any provision of these Terms of Use or participating in any other activity that we reasonably consider to be an abuse of the
    Program.
Engaging in any conduct or activity that artificially or deceptively impacts the earning or loss of Chegg Points of any Participant is prohibited
    and such abuse may lead to the removal or denial of Chegg Points, including of any redemption thereof.
Examples of conduct or activities that are an abuse
    of this Program whether conducted by one Participant or in conjunction with one or more other Participants or third parties, include any violation of the
    Chegg Terms of Use including the following:
A. 
    Copying all or significant parts of any answers or responses posted by others on the Chegg Platform and submitting them as a Participant's own submissions;
B. 
   	Copying all or significant parts of any answers or responses posted on other websites and submitting them as a Participant's own submissions; submissions
    despite the responses not pertaining to the question being asked;
C. 
    Creating multiple accounts to ask and answer a Participant's own questions; and/or
D. 
    Collaborating with another Participant to post questions and answers

    macro, cheat code, or other automated means to participate in the Program or to earn Chegg Points; (ii) your failure to follow any terms and conditions of
    the Program or the Web Site; (iii) Program inactivity for more than twenty four (24) months; (iv) the attempted or actual sale of any of your Chegg Points;
    (iv) any misrepresentation by you; (v) suspension of your Chegg Platform account; or (vi) any other conduct deemed by Chegg, in its sole discretion, to be
    detrimental to the interests of Chegg or its customers or otherwise improper.
If your ability to participate in the Program is revoked, any unused Chegg
    Points will automatically expire and your future participation in the Program may be prohibited.
In addition, Chegg will have the right to take appropriate
    administrative or legal action, including criminal prosecution, as it deems necessary in its sole discretion.
Chegg is not responsible for Chegg Points lost or redeemed due to fraudulent activity.
Suspected illegal, fraudulent or other unauthorized use or misuse of points or any other activity inconsistent with these Terms of Use will result in
    termination of your participation in the Program, which may result in the loss of all accumulated Chegg Points earned but not yet issued and Chegg Points
    issued but not yet redeemed.
You agree to abide by the final and binding decisions of Chegg regarding the Program and your participation in it.

General.
You and Chegg agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination,
	enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration; except that either
	party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court.
You acknowledge and agree that you and Chegg are each waiving the
	right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Further,
	unless both you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
	any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Legal Disputes" section will be deemed
	void.
This "Legal Disputes" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.
==========
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to
	seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened
	infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities
	provisions of this Agreement.
Arbitration Rules, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association
	("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the
	"AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Section of these Terms of Use.
(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)
==========
The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation
	and enforcement of this Section.
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
	conflict of laws provisions.
The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action taken in a small claims court as contemplated by these terms will be the
	courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
==========
Arbitration Process.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the
	AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477 and a separate
	form for California residents at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485.)
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law
	in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree
	upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA
	Rules.
==========
Arbitration Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your
	claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Chegg submit to the arbitrator, unless you
	request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by
	the AAA Rules.
==========
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent
	with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Arbitrator's Decision.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator's decision will include the
	essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
	jurisdiction thereof.
==========
The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of Limitation of Liability section of these Terms of Use as to the
	types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
	claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be
	entitled to an award of attorneys'' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Chegg will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it
	may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys'' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim
	for damages does not exceed $75,000, Chegg will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought
	in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
	Procedure 11(b)).
==========

Chegg Credit
From time to time, Chegg may issue you "Chegg Credit."
Upon providing you Chegg Credit, Chegg may place limits on its use, and Chegg Credit may not be
	moved from one Chegg Service to another.
==========
If provided to you in exchange for goods or services or as a refund, it will not expire, though we may with notice
	after a posted period of time convert your credit to cash and send it to your address of record.
If the credit was given to you with terms explicitly
	authorizing redemption for cash, you may convert that credit to cash.
If you receive a credit from customer support, you may not redeem it for cash.
Chegg Discount Codes, Bonuses, Coupons, Loyalty Programs, Points Programs & Other Promotions
From time to time, Chegg may offer discounts, bonuses, coupons, loyalty programs, points programs, sweepstakes, contests or other promotional
	incentives.
==========
These incentives typically have their own specific rules, restrictions and limitations (e.g., limiting when, how often, and under what
	circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion).
You are responsible for carefully reviewing and complying with these applicable rules, restrictions
	and limitations; certain promotions may not apply in certain jurisdictions where prohibited by law.
You agree not to engage in any self-dealing, collusion,
	smurfing (defined as breaking large orders or sales transactions into multiple individual transactions for the purpose of obtaining multiple discounts or
	payments), or otherwise gaming or defrauding the system.
By participating in such promotions, you agree to be bound by the applicable rules and
	restrictions, and that Chegg, in its sole discretion, may deny payment or benefits (e.g., when it believes improper activity has occurred or when a code
	has expired).
All promotions may expire at any time without notice to recipients.
Discounts apply only toward the actual base product/service rental or
	purchase cost; they do not apply to taxes, shipping, extension or late fees, or any other additional fees (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).
==========
Return of Digital Access Codes
Through the Services, you may purchase, as a separate product, a digital access code (DAC) to certain Digital Content.
The DAC publishers allow only one
	user (one activation) of these codes.
Chegg will ship your ordered DAC to you in sealed packaging.
If the DAC packaging is opened, Chegg must assume that
	the code is activated and therefore cannot be resold.
Thus, you may not return a DAC with opened packaging for a refund.
==========
Tax
Rentals and purchases through the Services may be subject to taxes in many states.
Depending on your state and the nature of the product or service you
	receive from us, this may be a rental tax, sales tax and/or use tax.
Tax rates are different from state to state.
You are responsible for paying all such
	taxes.
Supplemental Materials
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that supplemental materials (CDs and CD-ROMs, Workbooks, Study Guides) will be included with book rentals.
==========
However,
	they are available for purchase on select titles.
If you receive your rental book with any of the above items, you are welcome to use it.
We ask that you
	return your book complete with any supplemental materials you received.
==========
Asset Ownership
All rentals remain the property of Chegg even while the item is in your possession.
You may be given the option to purchase rented books from Chegg,
	either at the end of a rental cycle or at any point during the rental cycle.
If you wish to purchase a book you have rented through the Services, you may
	be able to do so by accessing your account on the Services and looking for the purchase option.
In this case, title (ownership) transfers to you as soon as
	your credit or debit card is approved for purchase value.
If you purchase the title through our purchase program, title (ownership) changes hands when we
	provide the book to the shipping company.
==========
Certain digital products may not be available for purchase or may have different purchase terms, and you
	should review their specific terms prior to rental or purchase.
Certain Payments and Renewals
Payment for certain Services is due in advance of each applicable membership period (e.g., monthly or annually).
MONTHLY AND ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS
	MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDE WILL BE CHARGED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD UNTIL YOUR
	MEMBERSHIP IS TERMINATED BY US OR CANCELLED BY YOU.
Also, for some of our paid Services, you may elect to temporarily "suspend" your membership,
	for example, during school breaks or vacation, for up to a total of 90 days in any one membership year (i.e., during each 12-month period following the
	commencement of your membership), and the period of your membership will be extended by the total amount of such suspended period(s).
==========
You agree to pay all
	applicable fees for your memberships and use of our paid Services, plus any applicable taxes or other charges as may be required, when due and payable.
All
	fees and charges are payable in advance and non-refundable, including after cancellation.
If you wish to cancel your membership in a Service (if
	available), please visit the customer support web area on the Services.
Cancellation of memberships (if available) will take effect as detailed in the
	cancellation information for the specific Service you want to cancel.
Free Trial Memberships
We may from time to time offer free trials for some of our Services.
Such trials may require you to register with a valid credit card to commence.
==========
Users
	that sign up for a free trial membership at a particular level will be automatically renewed at the promoted membership rate for that level at the end of
	the trial period unless the user cancels the membership at least before the end of the trial, unless the terms of the offer explicitly state otherwise.
You
	can cancel a free trial online on the Services or by contacting Chegg's customer support.
After cancellation of a free trial, you can continue as a Free
	Member with reduced benefits or access.
Only one free trial membership is allowed per person.
Subsequent registrations do not qualify for free trials.
Unless the terms of a promotion state otherwise, for promotions that include "free" periods with "paid" periods, paid periods will elapse first.
We may
	introduce new or additional features, services or materials to the Services which may be a part of, or priced separately from, existing levels of
	membership at our sole discretion.
==========
Chegg Honor Code
We work diligently to prevent misuse, but ultimately, the choice to act with academic honor and integrity is your own.
We know that most of you have
	never and will never abuse the Services or any of the information, services or materials available through them.
We take this opportunity, then, to
	highlight our commitment and your own.
We require every user and member to abide by our Honor Code.
You may not use any of the solutions, answers, materials or information available on or through the Services, to cheat.
==========
Examples include:
1.
Submitting any textbook solutions from the Services as your own to any class.
2.
Using our questions and answers service to complete tests or homework when instructed not to use outside help.
3.
Otherwise passing along any solutions, answers, materials or information from the Services as your own.
4.
==========
Any other violation of your instructor's or school's academic honor code.
We will take swift action against anyone found violating this Honor Code.
If Chegg is presented with evidence that its Services have been used in a
	manner contrary to its code, Chegg may, in its sole discretion, remove the materials and terminate the account of the involved users.
A message to students:
As current and former students, the Chegg team understands the pressures and time constraints school creates.
That being said, we also know from the
	unfortunate tales of our peers that the risk you take by violating your school's code of academic integrity is not worth the reward.
==========
Copying solutions or
	posting unexplained final answers promotes completion without comprehension, and that's something we don't support on this site.
A message to educators:
We are always seeking opportunities to work with educators in making our Websites a valuable resource for both you and your classroom for years to come.
If you need to contact us concerning an issue of academic integrity, please e-mail us at chegghonorcode@chegg.com.
==========
Miscellaneous
Unless otherwise stated in this agreement, if any provision of the Terms of Use is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions
	continue in full force and effect.
The failure of Chegg to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use is not a waiver of such right or
	provision.
The section titles of the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Non-performance of either party, except
	for the failure to make required payments, will be excused to the extent performance is delayed or rendered impossible by any reason where failure to
	perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party.
This "Miscellaneous" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your
	relationship with Chegg.
==========
Changes
Chegg may modify the Terms of Use including the linked policies contained herein from time to time, without prior notice.
By using our Services after we
	have updated the terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify), you agree to be bound by the then-current version of the Terms of
	Use, including any changes we may have made since the last time you used our Services.
It is therefore important that you review the Terms of Use regularly
	to ensure you are aware of any such changes.
The updated Terms of Use will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified
	in the updated Terms of Use, and will apply to your use of the Services from that point forward.
==========
Entire Agreement
The then-current Chegg Terms of Use, including (a) any related policies and terms referenced in the Terms of Use and (b) any Additional Terms, are the
	entire agreement between you and Chegg regarding the Services.
The Terms of Use may not be modified without the consent of a duly authorized representative
	of Chegg, and will supersede and prevail over any terms or conditions you may include with any purchase order or other transaction document or
	communication with us, regardless of whether Chegg signs them or fails to object to them.
This "Entire Agreement" section shall survive any expiration or
	termination of your relationship with Chegg.
