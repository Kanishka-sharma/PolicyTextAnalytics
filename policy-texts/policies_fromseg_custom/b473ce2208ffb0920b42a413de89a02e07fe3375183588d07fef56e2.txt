You expressly permit and authorize Juno and its affiliates (and such third parties as may be authorized by Juno, subject to the Privacy Statement) to furnish you, electronically when you use the Services or by any other means selected by Juno, information or materials prepared by Juno or by (or on behalf of) other entities, including advertising information, solicitations and software downloads.
You acknowledge that any such information, advertisements, solicitations and downloads are an inseparable part of the Services, and you understand and agree that the furnishing of such information, advertisements, solicitations and downloads to you cannot be terminated unless the Services are also terminated.
Some third parties furnishing you with advertisements and solicitations through the Services may permit you to "opt out" of receiving such communications from them, in which case you can do so by following the instructions they provide.
However, Juno is not responsible for any such party's failure to comply with its own "opt out" policies, nor does Juno endorse the views or content of any third party advertisements or solicitations.

8.4 Money Back Guarantee.
Juno may provide a thirty (30) day money back guarantee for some of the Juno Services (see your service plan description).
If your plan includes a money back guarantee, your thirty (30) day money-back guarantee begins upon the date Juno begins billing you for the Juno Service as described in the previous section.
During this thirty (30) day period you may cancel the Juno Service and receive a full refund of the monthly charge you have actually paid to Juno as well as any activation charges paid to Juno; provided, however, in order to receive your refund you must return all Equipment to Juno in good working condition within thirty (30) days of termination.
