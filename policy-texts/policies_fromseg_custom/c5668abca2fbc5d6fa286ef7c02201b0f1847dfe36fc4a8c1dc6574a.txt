Mission: Build public trust about the use and management of personal information
The collection of data occurs in every day City processes, such as paying a utility bill, renewing a pet license, browsing a web page, or signing up for an email list.
Police, fire and emergency services collect different forms of video and electronic data.
The increasing complexity of emerging technologies, business systems and laws mean the City must take appropriate steps to facilitate the collection, use, and disposal of data in a manner that balances the needs of the City to conduct its business with individual privacy, in a manner that builds public trust.
==========
The City of Seattle Privacy Program is designed to provide City employees guidance and tools to assist in incorporating the following actions into daily operations that involve personal information: Minimizing Data Collection, Providing Notice, Reviewing Legal Obligations, Reviewing Data and Systems Security and Deleting or De-identifying Data according to our data retention schedules.
What is Personal Information?
Personal information is any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.
Examples of personal information include but are not limited to a person's name, home or email address, social security number, religion, political opinions, financial and health records, and racial and ethnic origin.

This set of six principles provides an ethical framework for developing appropriate policies, standards and practices regarding the public's personal information.

Informed by the Privacy Principles, the Privacy Statement outlines our commitments about the collection and management of the public's personal information and both replaces and expands on our former Online Privacy Statement.
Privacy Policy 
The Privacy Policy provides direction to all City departments about our obligations to follow our Privacy Principles, Privacy Statement and our Privacy Review process.
Privacy Review Process
The three-step privacy review process helps those who manage City projects and programs incorporate our Privacy Principles and Privacy Statement into departmental operations.
