Notice to Parents/Guardians and Children Under 13
With parental consent, children can register at Brainly.com to pose and answer questions.
During the registration process, we ask registrants to provide their name, email address, and other information as listed below for notification and security purposes.
We may also ask for birthdates to validate ages.
==========
We only collect the information that is reasonably necessary for a child to participate in Brainly’s online activities.
We will also collect a parent/guardian’s email address, because portions of our site may be deemed to be directed toward children under the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
We will ask for a parent’s email address before collecting the name or email address or other identifying information from a site visitor who has self-identified as under 13 years of age.
We will not use parent emails provided for these registration purposes to market to the parent, unless a parent expressly opts in to such messages or separately has registered.
We will send an email to the parent to explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, and how the parent can provide or revoke consent.
If we do not receive parental consent within 48 hours, we will delete all parental contact information and any other information collected from the child in connection with this activity.
==========
Push Notifications
Push notifications are notifications on devices such as smartphones or tablets that run our Brainly app.
These can communicate to the device holder even when the application is not in use.
We will require a child to provide a parental email address before the child can receive push notifications, because such technology requires that we collect and use a unique device identifier from the mobile device.
We will then provide the parent with notice of our contact with the child and will provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications.
We will not associate the device identifier with other personal information without contacting the parent to get consent.
