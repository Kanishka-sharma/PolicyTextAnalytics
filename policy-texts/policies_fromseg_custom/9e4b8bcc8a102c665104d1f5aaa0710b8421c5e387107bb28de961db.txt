The Amazon.co.uk Privacy Policy

We
use the information we collect about you to process orders and to
provide a more personalised shopping experience.
Please read on for
more detail about our privacy policy.
What information do we collect?
How do we use it?
==========
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address,
delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date.
This allows us to process and fulfil your orders and to notify you of your order status.
We also ask for your telephone number which enables us to contact
 you urgently if there is a problem with your order.
For some
 international deliveries this number may be given to our couriers.
When you submit a customer review, we also ask for your e-mail address, although you can choose not to have your e-mail address displayed with your review.
When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.
==========
We personalise your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about the books, CDs and other merchandise that might be of interest to you.
We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the store.
We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify
you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new
Amazon.co.uk services and special offers we think you'll find
valuable.

How does Amazon.co.uk protect customer information?
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer
the use of a secure server.
The secure server software (SSL) encrypts
all information you input before it is sent to us.
Furthermore, as
required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access.
Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

==========
Also, Amazon.co.uk may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
