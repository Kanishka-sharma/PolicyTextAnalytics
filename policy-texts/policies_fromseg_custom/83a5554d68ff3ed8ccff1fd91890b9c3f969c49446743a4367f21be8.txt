Information We Collect
DNS Services Customers
OpenDNS runs a Domain Name System (DNS) service.
DNS translates the name (e.g., www.example.com) you type into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) and gets you to the place you want to go.
OpenDNS's DNS service collects non-personally-identifying information such as the date and time of each DNS request and the domain name requested.
In addition, OpenDNS also collects potentially personally-identifying information like the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from which DNS requests are made.
For its DNS services, OpenDNS temporarily stores logs to monitor and improve our quality of service, and to collect high-level aggregate statistics.
For customers without an account, OpenDNS removes the IP address from its logs within 2 business days.
For customers with an account, such data may be stored for as long as the account is open (although, customers with an account may also choose to have DNS data purged automatically, at any time, from within their account).
For customers using OpenDNS "Shortcuts" feature, DNS requests for certain domains may be directed through an HTTP proxy.
The data from the HTTP proxy is kept for approximately 12 hours for technical reasons.
Encrypted connections are never proxied.
==========
OpenDNS may aggregate personally-identifying information about the behavior of visitors to its websites and customers of its DNS services.
For example, OpenDNS may monitor which domains are most requested by its customers, or how many phishing attempts were blocked by its services.
OpenDNS may displays this information publicly or provide it to others in a non-personally identifiable aggregated form (e.g. statistical form).
==========

OpenDNS's purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how OpenDNS's visitors use its website.
From time to time, OpenDNS may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
