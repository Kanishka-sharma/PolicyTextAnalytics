Effective Date: March 22, 2017
This Privacy Policy is intended to explain clearly how we collect information from web sites, applications and other digital properties (we refer to all of these below as “Sites”) for use in our “Platform” and “Services”.
We also explain how information in our Platform is used to provide our Services, and how individuals can manage choices related to [m]PLATFORM Services.
Please note that because of the changing nature of privacy laws and regulations, digital technologies, and our business, we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Please review this Privacy Policy periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred.
If you continue to engage with [m]PLATFORM Services after any change in this Privacy Policy, we will take this as an indication that you have accepted the updated terms.

Who are we?
==========
[m]PLATFORM is a business in the GroupM media investment group; GroupM is part of the WPP, plc group of companies.
This Privacy Policy applies only to [m]PLATFORM and not to any other GroupM or WPP group company or business.
==========
What are our Services?
[m]PLATFORM owns and operates a technology platform (the “Platform”) that provides various advertising-related services for its clients.
Our clients include other GroupM and WPP group companies, which in turn perform advertising-related services for their own clients.
==========
This Privacy Policy outlines how and why [m]PLATFORM collects, uses, and shares data within the Platform.
It also outlines how individuals can manage choices related to [m]PLATFORM “Services”.
==========
We provide our clients with such services as: data management; audience and media insights, creation, modeling, planning and activation; analytics and attribution; visualization and reporting; and consultative services in connection with the foregoing (collectively, “Services”).
Our clients use our Platform and Services, on their own behalf and/or on behalf of their own clients, in order to deliver useful and relevant advertising to users and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising.
A customary use of our Platform and Services is to enable the delivery of customized advertising based on demographic information (such as age, gender, education, income and household status (e.g., number of children)), interests, prior activity and similar information (“User Information”).
==========
We call this type of advertising “Interest-Based Advertising”.
How do we collect information?
We may collect information through the use of cookies, advertising IDs, pixels, and other technologies.
Cookie
a small alphanumeric text file that is stored in a browser by a web site or by a third-party ad server or other third party which allows that web site or third party to recognize that browser and remember User Information and other information.
Our targeting cookie, which is named “Mookie” and operates on the mookie1.com domain, contains a unique randomly-generated value that is associated with User Information and other information.
The Mookie cookie, together with such associated information, is used in the performance of our Services, and in particular Interest-Based Advertising activities.
==========
Advertising ID
an alphanumeric identifier made available by a platform or operating system (such as Apple iOS or Google Android) that allows application developers and third parties to recognize a particular device in an application environment and remember User Information and other information.
Pixel
a line of code that is used by a Site or third party to assign online activities to a device or browser, or more specifically to the applicable cookie or advertising ID.
The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a device or browser has visited a particular Site or page.
We may associate the information collected over a period of time and from different Sites and across different devices and browsers.
==========
We may also integrate (and use in the same way) similar information obtained from other companies.
We make use of our own holistic identifier to associate information relating to devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the same user, in order to help provide more useful and relevant advertising regardless of device or browser.
What types of information are collected and utilized by [m]PLATFORM?
We may collect through our Services information regarding individuals’ browsing, usage and interactions when they view and interact with Sites and with advertisements where our Services are utilized.
We may also collect information that identifies browsers and devices with which we have interacted previously.
==========
Such information may include the type of Internet browser, browser language, and operating system, specific device’s Internet protocol address (“IP address”), unique identifiers available at or pertaining to a specific device, connection type (wired or Wi-Fi), region where the device is located, network to which the device is connected, longitude/latitude of a (mobile) device, mobile carrier (if available), the Site and page the device came from before, and visited after, viewing an advertisement, and information related to the Site and page being viewed (i.e., in order to ascertain interests).
Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an Internet connection.
==========
We may also receive information from other companies, including our clients, that is collected outside the Services and is provided to us for use in our Services and may be integrated into the Platform.
When do we share information?
[m]PLATFORM may share Platform information with clients for purposes of Interest-Based Advertising, analytics and reporting, and other online advertising activities.
We may also share information with third-party service providers that perform services and functions on our behalf and/or on behalf of our clients or their respective clients.
If we reasonably believe we are obligated by law or legal process to disclose information to a third party (including law enforcement), then we will do so.
In addition, may disclose information to a third party (including an auditor or other service provider) in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities and/or in order to review, evaluate, or address the integrity or security of our Platform and Services.
We may also provide to third parties (including our clients and their clients and potential clients) aggregated statistical data showing general usage patterns and statistics about Sites, interactions, and transactions; this aggregated data does not personally identify any user or provide specific information about individual usage.
==========

Opt Out 
You may opt out of [m]PLATFORM Interest-Based Advertising through several mechanisms.

Children’s Privacy

==========
Transfer of Data in the Event of Acquisition 
In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of our assets or all or substantially all of the assets of our Platform business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, corporate reorganization, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all information or all Platform information, as applicable, that is in our possession or under our control to the acquiring party.
Information Security 
We follow generally accepted online advertising industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to, unlawful processing of, unauthorized retention of, and unauthorized disclosure of data.
These standards include undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use.
==========
Please keep in mind, however, that despite these efforts to protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure.
Therefore, while we strive to protect such data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security in relation to any such data.
==========
[m]PLATFORM Services and the Platform are used globally and therefore we may transfer data to countries around the world, including countries outside your country or continent.
We will, where necessary, put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure such data is protected.
Data Retention 
We generally maintain the information we collect through our Services in non-aggregated form for a period of not more than 13 months.
This data may include Sites visited, content viewed, ad interactions, IP addresses (please see the “IP Address” subsection below for additional information), browser type and language settings.
We may maintain information we collect through our Services in an aggregated form for a period longer than 13 months.
==========
IP Address 
Please note that in some countries an IP address is considered personal data by applicable law.
If we collect information from any such country and we know that you are located in that country, we will treat your IP address as personal data.
For those countries we interpose a “black box” that is operated by an independent third party and that separates your IP address from other data we collect.
As a result of this black box, IP addresses for those countries do not touch [m]PLATFORM’S systems and are not processed by [m]PLATFORM in connection with the provision of Services.
==========
California 
Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.
To request a list of companies, if any, to which [m]PLATFORM has provided personal information for its own marketing purposes, please contact us via the email alias or address stated in “Questions or Comments about this Privacy Policy” below.
==========
Please allow 30 days for a response.
California law requires us to disclose how we respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals or other choice mechanisms relating to Interest-Based Advertising.
We have not yet developed a response to browser “Do Not Track” signals, and do not change any of our data collection practices when we receive such signals.
We will continue to evaluate potential responses to “Do Not Track” signals in light of industry developments or legal changes.
==========
We are committed to honoring privacy choices.
