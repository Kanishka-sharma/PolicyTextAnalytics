Aggregation sites are Internet sites that allow you to consolidate account information from several sources to be viewed on one site.
To do this, an aggregation provider may request access to your personal financial information.

Bank of America uses this information to help optimize your personal use of My Portfolio and to understand what account or service offers may be most beneficial to you.
Using other aggregation sites
If you provide information about your Bank of America accounts to an aggregator company, we will consider that you have authorized all transactions initiated by an aggregation site using access information you provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction.
If you decide to revoke the authority you have given an aggregator company, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America password to ensure that the aggregator company cannot continue to access your account.
