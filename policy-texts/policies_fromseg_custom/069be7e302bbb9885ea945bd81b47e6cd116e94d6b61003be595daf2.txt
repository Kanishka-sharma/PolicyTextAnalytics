PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: February 20, 2013
WHO WE ARE
Snapchat ("Snapchat", "we", "us") is a product of Snapchat, Inc.
We are currently based in Los Angeles, California.
This privacy policy
	has been prepared to clarify how we gather, use, disclose, and protect
	your personal information, as well as your messaging data.
We may
	change this policy at any time.
When we do, we will change the "Last
	Updated" date above.
==========
INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Information You Give Us
Snapchat collects the following information about its users:
	name, username, password, e-mail address, phone number, Facebook ID,
	and uploaded videos and images.
If you choose to "Find Friends," we
	will transmit your address book data to our servers to tell which of
	your friends use our service and help you connect with them.
Information Automatically Collected Through our Mobile App

	Additionally, we collect usage information and information about your
	device.
This information allows us to understand how users access and
	utilize the mobile application.
Once a user has downloaded and started
	using Snapchat, we automatically collect information such as the model,
	manufacturer and OS version of device used, MAC (Media Access Control)
	address, device identifiers, International Mobile Equipment Identity
	(IMEI), and time-stamped logs of messages sent and received including
	sender and recipient and data exchanges], and network status (WiFi,
	etc.).
We use all of this information to investigate trends and to
	restructure and improve the Snapchat application.
We also detect when
	users take actions relating to messages as further described below.
==========
To
	collect much of this information we use Flurry Analytics.
To learn
	about their information practices visit Flurry's Privacy
		Policy.
Information Collected on Snapchat.com

	When you visit our website, some information is automatically
	collected, such as your computer's operating system, Internet Protocol
	(IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and the website
	you visited before our site are logged automatically.
Cookies.
We may automatically collect information using "cookies."
Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website.
Among other things, cookies help us improve our website and your
	experience.
We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular
	and to count visits to our website.
Web Beacons.
We
	may collect information using Web beacons.
Web beacons are electronic
	images that may be used on our website.
We use Web beacons to deliver
	cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.
==========
Message Data
When you send or receive messages using the Snapchat services, we
	temporarily process and store your images and videos in order to
	provide our services.
Although we attempt to delete image data as soon
	as possible after the message is received and opened by the recipient
	(and after a certain period of time if they don't open the message), we
	cannot guarantee that the message contents will be deleted in every
	case.
For example, users may take a picture of the message contents
	with another imaging device or capture a screenshot of the message
	contents on the device screen.
Consequently, we are not able to
	guarantee that your messaging data will be deleted in all instances.
Messages, therefore, are sent at the risk of the user.
We also log
	information about messages, including time, date, and who sent and
	received the message.
==========
We also collect and use aggregated or de-identified information.
We may also collect information from other sources and associate that
	with any of the information described above.
Information we collect is stored on servers in the U.S. and
	subject to U.S. laws which may vary from laws in other countries.
==========

SHARING
Snapchat allows you to connect and share your messages with
	friends and find new friends.
When you create a user name, we create a
	public profile with that user name where users can contact you.
If the
	contact information you used to setup Snapchat is in a friend's address
	book, they can tell whether you are a Snapchat user when they sync
	their address books with Snapchat.
==========
Please be mindful of your own
	privacy needs as you choose who to connect with and what to share.
We
	cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to
	share with others.
If you share information about others, we suggest
	you get consent from them.
We will tell a friend who sends you a message when you open a
	message and when we detect that you have captured a screenshot of an
	image they send you.
We may also share your personal information with third parties
	including as follows:

with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing
		your information with other third parties for their own marketing
		purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;
with third party vendors, consultants and other service
		providers who work for us and need access to your information to do
		that work;
to: (a) satisfy any and all applicable laws, regulations,
		legal processes, or lawful government requests; (b) enforce our
		agreements, policies, and the Terms of Use, including investigation of
		potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise
		address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against
		harm to the rights, property, or safety of Snapchat, its users or any
		person as required or permitted by law;
in connection with or during negotiation of any merger,
		financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding
		involving sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a
		portion of our business or assets to another company.
We may also share aggregated or de-identified information.
DATA SECURITY
Snapchat takes reasonable steps to help protect your personal
	information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized
	access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
There are a number of
	risks in transmitting any kind of data over the public Internet and no
	company can prevent every risk.
Under no circumstances should you use
	the Snapchat service to transmit confidential or privileged information
	of any sort.
==========
INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES
You can choose who you get messages from and who you block using
	controls in the app.
Anyone can send you a message by default but you
	can choose to only receive messages from people you add to My Friends.
To do this go to the settings menu labeled "Who Can... Send me Snaps" and
	choose the options for "Everyone" or "My Friends."
You can also choose
	to block users from whom you do not wish to receive messages.
