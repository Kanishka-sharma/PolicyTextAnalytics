==========
We belong to the 24/7 Media Network, one of the largest advertising networks on the Internet.
This network uses its own ad serving system, 24/7 Connect, to display ads on this site.
Ads may contain cookies, and appear to be coming from our site, but in reality they are coming from our partners who are serving ads on our site.

Use of Cookies in 24/7 Connect

The 24/7 Connect advertsing delivery system uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer.
This allows us to measure and report aggregate information to advertisers such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency).
It also allows us to deliver ads that are more relevant to you and avoid delivering the same ads too many times.
==========
Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user.
24/7 Connect will only store information provided voluntarily, but this information is not personally identifiable.
If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept.
