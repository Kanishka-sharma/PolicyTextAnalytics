==========
Your Rights & Choices
You may have certain rights relating to your personal data, subject to local data protection laws.
Please note that you can only exercise these rights with respect to personal data that we process about you when we act as a data controller.
This is when Keap decides why and how your personal data will be processed, rather than our customers making those decisions.
To exercise your rights with respect to information processed by us on behalf of one of our customers, please read the privacy notice of our customer.
Depending on the applicable laws and, in particular, if you are located in the European Economic Area or the State of California in the United States, these rights may include:

Not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects; and
To the extent we base the collection, processing and sharing of your personal data on your consent, to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on such consent before its withdrawal.
==========
If you have given consent for your details to be shared with a third party, and wish to withdraw this consent, please also contact the relevant third party in order to change your preferences.
For State of California, United States of America, residents and households:
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.

==========
Only you (or if you are resident of California, a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf), may make a request related to your personal data.
You will need to provide us with sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal data.
==========

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request.

Making a request does not require you to create an account with us.
Unless otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, we will only use information provided in a request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
We generally do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded, and permitted by law.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee and such fee is permitted by law, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

==========
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any right afforded to you by any data protection law.

==========
If your data has been submitted to us by or on behalf of our customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly.
Because we may only act upon instruction from that customer, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of our customer who submitted your data to us.
