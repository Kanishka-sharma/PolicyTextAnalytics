About IP Addresses NFL.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web.
Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
==========
When guests request pages from NFL.com Online sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses.
We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.
==========
Links to Other Sites Users should be aware that when you are on NFL.com sites you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.
There are links to other sites from NFL.com sites that take you outside our service.
For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" takes you off the NFL.com site.
This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use a logo as part of a co-branding agreement.
These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.
Always be aware of where you end up.
==========
Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online - for example, via message boards or chat - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.
While NFL.com strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.
Security Policy The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us.
We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software.
Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed compressive nondisclosure agreements, which provides explicit legal confidentiality protections.
