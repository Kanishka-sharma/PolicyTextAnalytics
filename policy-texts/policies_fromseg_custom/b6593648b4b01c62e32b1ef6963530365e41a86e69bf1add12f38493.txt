COMET SYSTEMS COMMITMENT TO USER PRIVACY
Comet Systems

has taken concrete steps to safeguard the privacy of people who use our software.
You are never asked to fill out a registration form when getting the Comet Cursor no name, no email, no 
credit card information, etc.
Since we don't have your email address, you will never get spam (junk email) 
from us or anyone else as a result of using the Comet Cursor.
In fact, you'll never get any email at all from 
us since we never asked you for your email address in the first place.
The only times you'll get an email 
from Comet are when you email us first (for example, if you request technical support) or if you sign up for 
one of our newsletters.
If at any point you no longer want to receive our newsletters, you can unsubscribe by

Many people are concerned about companies tracking what Websites they visit.
Comet Systems doesn't 
profile its users, and never has.
We do not keep track of where you go on the internet and since we don't 
collect clickstream data, we certainly don't sell it.
==========
When our software reports back to our servers, it is to 
log interactions with our software, so as to keep count of how many times people selected the American 
Flag cursor, for example, or how many times people saw our Travel Assistant price grid on any given day.
Our client software is also in communication with our servers to check for regular bug fixes and updates.
Since you never give us your name or any other personal information about yourself, our usage logs and 
update-checks are designed to be totally anonymous.
Some inaccurate information appeared in late 1999 regarding our information practices, concluding that 
since our client software talks to our servers, we must therefore be tracking where people go on the Web.
==========
That's flatly untrue and many respected publications have since issued retractions or corrections on their 
stories, including Industry Standard, ABC News, PC Magazine, ZDNet, Time Digital, CNET, Business 
Week, and the Christian Science Monitor.
You can click on the Corrections and Retractions link to read 
these retractions and corrections.
We are grateful to these publications for doing their homework and, in 
light of the facts, acknowledging that the Comet Cursor is not "spyware".
We encourage people to contact us if they have any questions about our privacy practices.
==========
We're a small 
company and aim to be transparent about how we do business.

Finally, we encourage you to read our plain-English
Privacy Policy
