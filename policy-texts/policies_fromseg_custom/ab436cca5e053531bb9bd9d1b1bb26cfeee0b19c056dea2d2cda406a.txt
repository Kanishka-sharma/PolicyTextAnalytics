==========
Information We Collect and How We Use It
Our vision is to maximize your rewards and to provide you with as many member benefits as possible.
The key way in which we provide value is to share with you the commissions we receive from our merchant partners in the form of Cash Back.
We strive to confirm and pay your Cash Back quickly and reliably, and to improve your experience on our site and in our applications – these are the main reasons we collect information.
==========
Ebates.com
When you become a member of Ebates.com, we collect your name, email address, and physical address (“Personal Information”).
We use your Personal Information to track and send you Cash Back payments and generally to improve and personalize our services.
We also collect non-personal information pertaining to our merchant partners you visit, the purchases you make, and the offers you view (“Transaction Information”).
We use Transaction Information to process your Cash Back faster and more reliably, as well as to provide more relevant offers for you when you visit us or use our applications and services.
==========
Buy Now Shopping Cart Service and In-Store Offers
When you use our Buy Now shopping cart service, we collect and store your credit card information to assist you in completing purchases quickly and efficiently (for example, so you will not have to type your credit card number to complete a purchase using a mobile device).
Similarly, we collect your credit card information in connection with In-Store Offers, pursuant to which you can earn Cash Back on your offline purchases at our merchant partners.
In connection with In-Store Offers, we transmit your credit card information to one of our service providers, who uses it to match offers you click with purchases you complete, enabling us to award you Cash Back.
We store your credit card information in a secure manner.
==========
Browser Button and Mobile Application
When you use the Ebates browser button or the Ebates mobile application, we will collect your browsing history and your Transaction Information.
We share this Transaction Information as needed with our affiliate network partners and merchant partners in order to confirm your Cash Back faster and more reliably, and we use it to provide you more relevant and interesting offers.
We may also share Transaction Information on an anonymous basis with our corporate affiliates (companies commonly owned by Rakuten, Inc.) in order to understand industry trends.
This anonymous Transaction Information may be aggregated with other information and shared as general shopping analysis and trends.

We reserve the right to disclose information we collect (including Personal Information) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or other lawful requests by public authorities, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or our corporate affiliates, or to protect us, our corporate affiliates, or our members from losses.

How We Keep Your Information Secure
The security of your Personal Information is important to Ebates.
