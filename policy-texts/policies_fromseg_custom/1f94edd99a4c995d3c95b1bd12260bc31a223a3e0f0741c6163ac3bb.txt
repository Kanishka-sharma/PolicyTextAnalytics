Student group files complaint against U.S. firms over NSA data snooping
A student group has charged several U.S. technology companies with violations of European law for allegedly cooperating with the NSA to collect data on private citizens.
Known as Europe-v-Facebook (EVF), the group of Austrian students announced Wednesday that it filed formal complaints with the EU against Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Skype, and Yahoo.
The group contends that since the five companies do business in Europe through subsidiaries, they fall under European privacy laws.
Such laws allow the export of data only if the company's European subsidiary can guarantee an "adequate level or protection" in the home country.

A modest proposal for privacy control
Privacy policies, with disclosures about what kind of information Internet services collect about you and how to manage your online profile, are notoriously obtuse, incomplete, and difficult to master.
They aren't as obtuse as the National Security Agency is about its data collection policies, but the vast majority of online users have little interest in trying to parse the language or even in trying to actively manage their profiles with the tools offered today.
The companies that collect data, of course, want to assure you that whatever they collect is in pursuit of creating a better experience for you … Read more

Over 1 million American Android users have downloaded adware
Adware has become a somewhat concerning issue on Android, a new study from security firm Lookout has discovered.
According to the security company, over the last year alone, over 1 million American Android users have unknowingly downloaded adware.

Google: Hacked sites far worse than attack sites
Web sites you think are safe but have been compromised to distribute malicious software are far more prevalent than sites that are intentionally dangerous, according to a new Transparency Report from Google released on Tuesday.
The new Safe Browsing section of the report reveals some of the security trends that Google has been seeing.
While Google reiterated that its Safe Browsing program flags up to 10,000 sites a day, the report showed that hacked sites remain a major problem -- with about 60 percent hosting malware and 40 percent being used for phishing attacks.

The parliamentary committee investigating the data retention proposal and a number of other proposed legislative changes to telecommunications and national security legislation today issued its report, and put the decision on whether to progress with a mandatory data retention scheme back on the government.
