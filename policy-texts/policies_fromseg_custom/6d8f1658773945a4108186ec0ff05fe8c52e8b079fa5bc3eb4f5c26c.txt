Collecting information about users of the website
The University web server, and cookies installed by the server on users' computers' hard drives, record the following non-identifying information in relation to all users:
the user's computer address and an anonymous user-id (identifier)

A cookie is a small text file which has a limited lifetime.
Information supplied by cookies helps us learn about how people use our site, analyse our visitors and provide users with a better user experience.
A cookie allows a web server to 'remember' the visitor on subsequent visits without having to prompt the visitor for information previously supplied.
A cookie may also be used to personalise your web experience.
An example of this would be a cookie remembering courses you previously viewed.
The installation of cookies may be blocked via the user's web browser if the user does not wish to accept cookies, but this may mean that the user will not be able to access some parts of the University's website without re-authenticating on each visit.
