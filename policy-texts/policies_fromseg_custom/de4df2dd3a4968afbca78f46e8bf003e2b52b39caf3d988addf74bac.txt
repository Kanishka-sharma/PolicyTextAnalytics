Privacy Policy and Patent Notice
              ScorecardResearch, a service of Full Circle Studies, Inc., is used to help with the collection of Internet web browsing data on specific websites that have enrolled in a broad market research effort by comScore, Inc. to create reports on Internet behavior and trends.
comScore, Inc. is a recognized authority on Internet and general economic trends, whose data are routinely cited by major media outlets such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and CNBC, and is extensively used by the largest Internet services companies and scores of Fortune 500 companies.
To learn more about comScore, please see www.comscore.com.
comScore (further referred to as “we,” “us” and “our”), is a member of TRUSTe's TRUSTed Data Collection Program, signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your information.

If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe here.

How do you use tagging and cookies to collect information?
As part of this market research effort, participating websites agree to deploy ScorecardResearch web tags throughout their site.
These tags send a message to ScorecardResearch that causes ScorecardResearch to drop a cookie.
==========
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive (see “cookie” section below).
This process, which we refer to below as “browser-level measuring,” is done so that ScorecardResearch is able to identify browser-level behavior such as new versus repeat visitors to a website or page.
ScorecardResearch uses the combination of tagging and cookies to help websites count users who have visited and seen a page or various parts of a page.
We require that any website using our tagging and cookies include a notice about the use of tagging and cookies to collect anonymous traffic data and to state what choices are available to users regarding the use of the information collected.
In certain instances, the cookie may be set by an advertising network or advertiser.
If this advertising network or advertiser is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance, notice may be provided by clicking on the DAA icon.
==========
What information, including personal information, is collected?
The tagging used by ScorecardResearch is unable to identify the user visiting a page.
As an example, our tags may collect such data as a timestamp, the URL, and the title of the web page.
Additionally, the data collected by ScorecardResearch is only used in an aggregated form.
In other words, the reports that are created from this data will never say that Computer 1 went from Site A to Site B to Site C.  Instead, the reports will always be based on an entire collection of different computers, meaning that the reports will contain information like “67% of the entire internet population went to Site A”, or “35% of individuals who went to Site A also went to Site B.”
            How is the information used?
==========
This information helps our clients understand general visitation patterns to the participating website.
How is the information disclosed?
This information is analyzed and the resulting reports are shared with our clients.
These reports help our clients understand general internet behavior.
How long do you retain the information you collect?
==========
The data collected through browser-level measurement is typically maintained for up to 90 days.
Such data may be aggregated and used for analytical purposes indefinitely.
Additionally, in certain circumstances, for instance when a specific site has asked for detailed reporting, selected anonymous records relating to that specific site may be maintained indefinitely.
==========
How do I opt out?
To opt-out of this browser-level measuring, you can click here.
If you choose to opt-out, a cookie will be placed on your computer instructing us to disable our ability to perform browser-level measurements of your website visitation while on a website with a ScorecardResearch beacon installed.
However, if your browser does not accept cookies, or if you delete all of your cookies, then this browser-level measurement may occur.
Additionally, this opt-out is only effective when you are using the Internet browser you were using when you opted-out.
==========
As part of its market research efforts, ScorecardResearch may also provide short surveys.
The surveys are completely voluntary, and are only used to collect non-personal information in an effort to further refine the market research.
You can opt-out of receiving these surveys by clicking here.
If you choose to opt-out, a cookie will be placed on your computer instructing us to disable our ability to provide you with these surveys.
However, if your browser does not accept cookies, or if you delete all of your cookies, then you may be provided with an invitation to participate in a survey.
Additionally, this opt-out is only effective when you are using the Internet browser you were using when you opted-out.
