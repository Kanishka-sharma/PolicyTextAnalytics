The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA") provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright laws have been infringed online.
Under the DMCA, copyright owners may contact the authorized agent of an Internet service provider to report alleged infringements based on unauthorized use of their protected works appearing on web pages hosted by the service provider.
Upon receipt of properly filed complaints satisfying the requirements of the DMCA, Court TV will remove or block access to the allegedly infringing material posted by third party users of the Court TV websites.
If a Court TV user who posted such material believes in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed, the user may submit a counter-notice to provoke a private dispute with the copyright owner.
Court TV will not be a party to such disputes over alleged copyright infringement.
