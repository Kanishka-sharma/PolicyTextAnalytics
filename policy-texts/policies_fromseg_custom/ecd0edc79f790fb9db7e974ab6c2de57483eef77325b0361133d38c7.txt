Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.

We use persistent cookies and clear GIFs to determine activity at the client's site.
With respect to individuals who visit those sites as a result of clicking on a customer ad on  search engines, our ad server will place or read a unique tracking cookie on the computer and will use non-personal information about the browser and activity at this site (such as a Web surfer's IP address, Web pages which have been viewed by a Web surfer, date and time) to track whether the referral results in a transaction, as defined by the customer.
