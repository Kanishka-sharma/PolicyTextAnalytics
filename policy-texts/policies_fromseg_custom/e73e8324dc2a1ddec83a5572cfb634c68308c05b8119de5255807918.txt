Rockerbox, Inc. ("we", "our", and "us") offers a technology platform that helps marketers understand the value of various offline and online channels.
For digital ads we do this by tracking media exposure (the users who saw an ad), media response (i.e., the users who clicked an ad) and conversion (i.e., the action a Client hopes a user will take - an online purchase, a registration, or similar).
Rockerbox is committed to protecting your privacy.

INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM
Overview of Data Collection via the Platform
Rockerbox's Services include data collection, user mapping, and user path analysis - the results of which are delivered solely to our Clients in aggregated form.
Data collection is a process that centralizes, cleans and normalizes data from each of the Client's marketing vendors and each source where a consumer engages in a desired behavior (for example: a purchase which occurs on a Client’s website).
Our Clients, who are generally businesses seeking to market a product or service, use this information in order to help them optimize marketing programs.
In order to provide the Services, Rockerbox works with Marketers, Marketing Vendors and Third Party Data Providers.
Marketers: Rockerbox offers its services to digital marketers that advertise to consumers and may work with them directly or indirectly through an Advertising Agency they employ.
Marketing Vendors: The companies that provide marketing services to Marketers.
This may include digital marketing such as Search Engine Marketing, Email Marketing, Display Advertising or others.
==========
It may also include vendors that provide offline marketing such as for television, radio or mail.
Third Party Data Providers: Rockerbox works with companies that assist in stitching user data together from disparate sources.
For example, companies that provide offline purchase data for Marketers.
What data does Rockerbox collect via the Platform?
Our Platform receives data each time a Client's ad is viewed or clicked, including the following:
A Unique ID - Our systems collect a pseudonymous unique identifier relevant to the source of data.
For browsers this will be from a unique user id created by Rockerbox and placed into a cookie.
On mobile devices, we use the mobile advertiser ID provided by the mobile O/S (i.e., the - Apple ID for Advertising (IDFA) or the Android Advertising ID (AAID).
On a Connected TVs, we use the subscriber ID provided by the connected TV manufacturer.
None of these IDs may be used by Rockerbox to identify an actual person, but they allow our Platform to unique identify a browser, computer, TV or mobile device over time.
Ad serving and log file data - Our systems also obtain information about the ad that was served including ad campaign meta-data provided by the Client, the date/time the ad was served, the user agent and IP address (which helps us infer city, region or country), the referrer and the landing page URL of an ad clicked on.
==========
This information is only stored temporarily for testing purposes.
Client provided data - In addition to the above information our Clients may provide us additional identifiable information about you including a unique user identifier created by each Client, the total amount spent on a purchase, whether or not you are a returning customer or other relevant dimensional data (e.g. a segment you belong to or relevant to an event completed on their site).
How does Rockerbox use the data collected via the Platform?
Rockerbox primarily uses the data collected about your browser or device to provide our Services, which include:
User-path management - Our platform collects data about your browser or device over time to create what we call a "user path".
A user path helps our Clients better understand whether their ads are engaging and driving users to visit their sites and/or purchase their products and services, among other things.
User segmentation - Our Platform will collect "meta-data" over time which enables our Clients to place their users into profile segments such as "new customer" and "existing customer" which helps them better understand the effectiveness of their marketing programs.
==========
What Tracking Technologies does Rockerbox use on the Platform?
Rockerbox collects data in various ways.
Some Clients allow us to place tracking pixels and JavaScript tags onto their websites.
In these cases, we use cookies to uniquely identify users over time as ads are viewed, clicked on and other actions performed on a Client's website.
Other Clients simply pass data to us directly, or via their market vendor or third-party partner such as their ad server.
==========
We also engage in cookie synching and other forms of ID synchronization.
ID Synchronization occurs when Rockerbox provides known user identifiers to a 3rd party data provider who then identifies the user within their dataset and map their unique identifier to the identifier provided by Rockerbox.
Rockerbox engages in ID synchronization with 3rd party data providers in order to identify users that Rockerbox thinks as separate users which that provider may know is the same user and to augment user path data; that is to add knowledge of non-digital media stimulation, media response and conversions to user paths.
On a mobile device we will use cookies within a browser app or we will collect data through server-to-server (postback) integrations with individual application owners and the mobile analytics companies that they have integrated with.
