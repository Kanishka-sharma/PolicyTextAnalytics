California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights
California Consumer Protection Act
Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California law gives its residents the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information (if we sell such information), subject to certain restrictions.
For security purposes, we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you -- when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.
You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.
This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.
Right to Know
If you are a California resident, you may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the following information:
• The specific pieces of personal information we have about you;
• The categories of personal information we collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose about you within the last 12 months;
• The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
• The purposes for which the information was collected or sold; and
• The categories of third parties to whom the information was sold, disclosed for a business purpose, or otherwise shared.
==========
If possible, we will provide this information to you in a readily usable format that allows transmission to another entity.
The easiest way to submit a request and receive your report is to email us at privacy@assmb.ly.
Right to Delete
If you are a California resident, you may submit a verifiable request for us to delete the personal information we have collected about you.
The easiest way to submit a request for deletion is to email us at privacy@assmb.ly.
Right to Opt-Out
California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information, as defined by the CCPA.
==========
This does not include when:
• You direct us to disclose your personal information or use us to interact with a third party and the third party does not sell the personal information; • We use or share an identifier solely to alert a third party you have opted out of the sale of your personal information; • Your personal information is transferred as an asset as part of a transaction in which the third party assumes control of all or part of our business, in which case the third party would have to tell you in writing if it materially changes how the information is used or shared; and • We use or share your personal information under a written contract with a service provider necessary to perform a business purpose.
Here, the service the service provider performs is on our behalf, and our written contract prohibits it from keeping, using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose identified in the contract.
In these cases, the disclosure of your personal information would not be considered a “sale” under CCPA.
We use and share your information as described in this privacy policy and do not believe this use and sharing is a sale as defined by the CCPA.
==========
We have not sold personal information about you in the last 12 months and currently have no plans to do so in the future.
However, we have provided you with a system to record your preference that your data not be sold in the future.
You may make this request emailing us at privacy@assmb.ly.
==========
Right to be Free from Discrimination
We may not discriminate against you because you have exercised your rights, including, for example, by denying you access to our owned and/or operated websites.
Authorized Agents
If you would like to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, please be sure the agent can (i) demonstrate you have provided written permission for the agent to submit the request on your behalf, and (ii) provide proof of his or her own identity.
If the agent does not satisfy these requirements, we will deny the request.
