Website Visitors

      Like most website operators, Slides collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Slides’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Slides’ visitors use its website.
From time to time, Slides may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Slides also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.
Slides only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

In each case, Slides collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Slides.
