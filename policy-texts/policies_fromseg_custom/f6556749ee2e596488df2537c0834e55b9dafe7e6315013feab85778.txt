          Claria does not collect personally identifiable information about you from the SearchScout web site.

Cookies
          SearchScout does not currently send or drop cookies on your computer.
A cookie is a text file stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive that identifies your computer as a unique user.
Note that if there are multiple users of your computer, the cookie does not distinguish between users, it only identifies the computer.
==========
Web Beacons
          The SearchScout Web site may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that help Claria count the number of users who have viewed that page.
Claria does not associate web beacons with cookies or any personally identifiable information.
However, Claria may use the web beacons to compile aggregated statistics of the use of the SearchScout web site.
Links
          Claria does not own or control the web pages that are linked by search results and, therefore, the information that such web pages collect from you or the cookies such web pages set on your computer are not in the control of Claria.
Claria search results may contain a "URL redirector" that sends you to Claria's affiliates who operate the search engine underlying SearchScout, who, in-turn, send you to the web page you requested.
Operating a search engine is an expensive proposition, and thus many search portals, including SearchScout, operate in this fashion.
==========
IP Addresses
          When your web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information.
This is called your computer's "IP address."
(IP stands for "Internet Protocol.")
For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time you log on.
Claria and/or its search engine affiliates may use your IP address to diagnose problems with the Claria web site and to detect the unauthorized use of robots, spiders, or crawlers on the SearchScout web site.

With Whom Does Claria Share Information
          Claria may share aggregated information about our users with actual or potential advertisers, affiliates, or other third parties.
For example we may share the aggregate number of users that used a particular search term or the number or percentage of clicks on search results.
==========
Claria does not, however, share personally identifiable information with third parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Claria will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.
