A separate privacy policy is in effect for LifeStreet's web sites, which may be viewed here.
Type of Information Collected and Use of Information.

("Non-PII")  We use the following technology to obtain this Non-Personally Identifiable Information:

==========
Web BeaconsA web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique, anonymous user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.
They are also known as "clear gifs", "one-pixel gifs", "web bugs", "Internet tags", or "pixel tags."
This allows LifeStreet to track certain websites you visit or applications you use.
Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in.
==========
IP AddressesYour Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP").
For local area networks ("LAN"),  and accounts provided by some ISP's, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer.
IP addresses are automatically logged by LifeStreet's Web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns.
While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web.
Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using.
==========
Computer ProfilesLifeStreet may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of consumers.
For instance, LifeStreet may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.
How Information is Shared
Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information to Business Partners
            
            With respect to data collected via our Ad Network, including user behavior data, we may combine the Non-PII we collect with Non-PII obtained from other sources.
We may also disclose this Non-PII and combined information to participating Advertisers, Publishers and other business partners to improve the relevance and effectiveness of the advertising presented to consumers.
For example, we use data collected via our Ad Network to create anonymous consumer segments.
These segments will be used to target and optimize Advertiser campaigns.
==========

            LifeStreet will use or disclose your Non-PII in response to subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or legal process, or to otherwise establish or exercise LifeStreet's legal rights or defend against legal claims or in the event of a breach in an agreement with LifeStreet.
