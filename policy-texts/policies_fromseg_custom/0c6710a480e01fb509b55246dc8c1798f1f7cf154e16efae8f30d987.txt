If you choose to identify yourself by sending us an email or when using our secure online forms (e.g., Bureau of Consumer Protection, Project Know Fraud, or Identity Theft complaint forms, or our FOIA Request Form):
We use personally-identifying information from consumers in various ways to further our consumer protection and competition activities.
We collect this information under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission Act and other laws we enforce or administer.
We may enter the information you send into our database to make it available to our attorneys and investigators involved in law enforcement.
We also may share it with a wide variety of other government agencies enforcing consumer protection, competition, and other laws.

If you contact us because you have been the victim of Identity Theft, we also may share some information you provide with certain private entities, such as credit bureaus and any companies you may have complained about, if we believe that doing so might help resolve identify theft-related problems.
In addition, when you submit a complaint, you may be contacted by the FTC or any of the agencies or private entities to whom your complaint has been referred.
If you contact us to order publications, we will use your information only to fulfill your order or to contact you about your order.
In other limited circumstances, including requests from Congress, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests from private individuals, or in accordance with our public record rules, we may be required by law to disclose the information you submit.
If you use one of our online forms, the information you provide is up to you.
If you don't provide your name or other information, it may be impossible for us to refer, respond to, or investigate your complaint or request.
If you want to get information about you that may be in our records:
The Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974 provide you certain rights to get information about you that is in our records.
