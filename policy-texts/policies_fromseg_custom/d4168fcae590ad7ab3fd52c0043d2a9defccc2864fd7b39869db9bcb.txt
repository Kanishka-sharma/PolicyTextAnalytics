Services Privacy Policy


1.
==========
Overview of our Services
We provide online advertising services to our clients in the programmatic advertising
							environment.
Our solution is used by advertisers to display ads of their products or
							services on publishers’ websites, mobile applications, connected TVs or digital out of
							home devices.
Some of our ads are personalized, i.e., based on the information on your
							previous online activity.
We  display to you the ads of those advertisers whose websites
							or apps you had visited in the past (a service known as retargeting) or ads that we
							believe otherwise match your current shopping interests.
In order to serve personalized
							ads, we process certain information related to your online activity that helps us
							understand what your current shopping interests might be and allows us to display an ad
							and analyze how it performs.
==========
While doing so, we aim at ensuring the highest level of
							privacy protection and transparency.
We strictly comply with all applicable privacy laws,
							in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Directive on Privacy and
							Electronic Communications (E-Privacy Directive), as well as established best practices on
							the digital advertising market.
2.
==========
How we collect your Data
In order to collect your data, we use cookies, which are text files inserted in your web
							browser when you visit advertisers’ or publishers’ websites or apps, as well as other
							tracking technologies available on your device, such as mobile advertising ID.
They allow
							us to register certain activities you perform on those websites or apps.
We operate under
							the adelement.com domain while providing our services.
3.
==========
Data we Process
We process the following three main groups of data:
							
							a) Information related to your viewing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps —
							it helps us understand what sorts of products and services you are interested in and,
							consequently, determine which ads should be displayed to you to match your current
							shopping interests.
We process this data on behalf of the advertisers for whom we
							conduct advertising campaigns (as a data processor), specifically for the purpose of
							creating your user profile.
b) Information that you are currently entering a publisher’s website or app,
							where we may display an ad to you — it comes within a so called bid request, which is
							an offer to buy an advertising space on the publisher’s website or app in order to
							display an ad (for details, see Section 4 below).
==========
We process this information as a data
							controller for the purposes of displaying ads, ad measurement, brand safety, product
							development, and fraud detection.
c) Information regarding the delivery of our ads, i.e., impressions of an ad
							(e.g., whether we displayed an ad to you and, if so, which ad we selected) and your
							interactions with an ad (e.g., whether you clicked on it).
We process this information
							as a data controller for the purposes of displaying ads (in particular for frequency
							capping and ad rotation), ad measurement, and product development.
You may find a full list of categories of data we process as a data controller in
							our GDPR privacy notice (see Section 5 below).
==========
While providing our services, we do not collect personally identifiable information
							(PII), such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, or
							financial data, such as credit card details.
We do not receive any additional data from advertisers or partners, which, along
							with the data collected by our technology, would enable us to directly identify you.
4.
==========
How we use your Data
	While you are visiting an advertiser’s website or app, we collect  information
							related to your activity there, such as which items you viewed, put in the basket, and
							bought.
Those browsing patterns on the advertiser’s website or app help us understand
							what sorts of products and services you are interested in and thus display to you, on
							publishers’ digital properties (e.g., news portals, apps), only ads compatible with
							these interests.
We display our personalized ads with the use of a programmatic instantaneous
							auction system known as real-time bidding (RTB).
Real-time bidding procedure happens at
							the moment you enter a publisher’s website or app that offers an advertising space for
							sale.
While such website is loading, a bid request is sent to us by the publisher or
							our business partner cooperating with the publisher (e.g., supply-side platform, SSP)
							inviting us to buy a certain ad space.
After receiving such bid request, our technology
							uses information about your previous browsing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps
							to decide whether to buy the auctioned ad space and, if so, which ad to display.
==========
For instance, if you had recently visited our client’s website looking for jeans,
							we may display to you an ad of those same jeans you had viewed there and similar jeans
							or complementary products, such as T-shirts offered by that client.
We may also use information on the content of the website where the ad is to be
							displayed for the additional personalization of this particular ad.
However, we never
							use such website content to personalize future ads, in particular we do not assign this
							information to your user profile in order to categorize you (e.g., by assigning you to
							a particular population segment) or try to determine your shopping interests on the
							basis of your browsing history on publishers’ websites or apps.
Moreover, we do not use your browsing data across advertisers, which means that a
							browsing activity from one advertiser’s website or app does not affect other
							advertisers’ ads we display.
For instance, the fact that you looked for running
							equipment in an app of our client “A” will not result in us displaying you running
							equipment from an app of our client “B” (unless you had previously browsed similar
							products on “B” app as well).
==========
After we display an ad to you, we collect information regarding ad impressions
							(e.g., that we indeed displayed an ad to you, which ad was selected, and when and on
							what type of device it was displayed) and your interactions with the ad (mainly whether
							you clicked on it or not).
We use this information for the analysis of how our ads
							perform, for the creation of statistical reports for advertisers regarding the delivery
							of their ads, and subsequently for attribution and billing purposes.
We also process
							this data for the control of the frequency of ads we display to you (frequency capping)
							and for product development purposes.
==========
Our platform is integrated with the RTB environment through matching of our
							technical identifiers, e.g., cookie IDs or mobile advertising IDs (“cookie matching”)
							with those used by our business partners.
It enables us to (a) receive a bid request
							and eventually serve an ad on a publisher’s website or app that uses our business
							partners’ digital advertising technology and (b) collect information related to our ad
							serving activities.
Upon an advertiser’s specific request and on the basis of the information provided
							by such advertiser, we may perform cross-device tracking that consists of displaying
							the same categories of ads of this particular advertiser’s products or services on
							different devices you use (e.g. laptops and smartphones).
We do not, however, perform
							specific data analyses in order to link the devices you use on the basis of the
							patterns of your online behavior (i.e., we do not conduct probabilistic cross-device
							tracking).
==========
We also use your personal data for the detection of frauds and other potential
							dangers to privacy security, for the calculation of the usage levels of our technology,
							and for brand safety purposes, i.e., to analyze whether publishers’ websites are a
							suitable environment for our ads to be displayed and to develop and improve our
							products.
Advertisers and publishers whose websites or apps you visit may independently
							collect and use your data for different purposes.
Please consult their privacy policies
							for more information in this regard.

Personal Data Processing (GDPR)

								Although, as described above, we do not collect personally identifiable information
							(PII), the data we do process is tied to unique online identification numbers that,
							under the GDPR, are considered “online identifiers” that allow us to “single out” a
							specific user from other users.
According to the GDPR, such information may be
							considered personal data (this type of non-personally identifiable data is referred to
							as “pseudonymous data”).
Consequently, in cases where the GDPR applies to our services,
							we assure compliance with all the requirements established by this regulation.
==========
We have also appointed a data protection officer, whom you may contact if you have
							further questions.
Please see Section 9 below for the Data Protection Officer contact
							details.
As a part of the GDPR compliance program, we have joined the IAB Europe
							Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) as a registered vendor (ID No.: 196) and comply
							with the TCF policies.
==========
For more information, please visit https://iabeurope.eu/.
As mentioned above, some of data we use for providing services, we process as a
							data controller, which means we are solely responsible for it, and some – as a data
							processor i.e. on behalf of advertisers.
You may access a set of information required
							by the GDPR pertaining to our data processing activities as a data controller in our
							GDPR Privacy Notice.

							on publishers’ websites or apps.
You are entitled to withdraw the consent to the

							cooperating with publishers for the purposes of delivering personalized advertisements.
We collect some of the information, such as data related to ad impressions and your
							interactions with ads, ourselves from publishers’ websites or apps.
==========
Recipients of the personal data We may transfer your data to our processors (e.g.,
							IT service providers and data centers) where such entities process data on the basis of
							a contract with us and only in accordance with our instructions.
We may also transfer very limited amounts of data to our business partners (e.g.,
							SSPs) in a response to a bid request in order to be technically able to display an ad.
Data subject’s rightsYou have the following rights with respect to your personal
							data:

							an opt-out procedure without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent

							conduct activities that may be deemed “profiling” of your personal data only to a very
							limited extent (i.e., analysis of data regarding ad impressions and your interactions
							with our ads for ad measurement purposes).
We do, however, conduct profiling with respect to the data related to your browsing
							activity on advertisers’ websites or apps (i.e., data we process on behalf of
							advertisers, as a data processor).
We analyze it in order to display to you an ad that
							we believe you will be most interested in, as described in Section 4 above.

In particular, it does not result in price
							discrimination among the users based on their behavioral profile.
==========
Retention periodsWe immediately delete all data received in bid requests, except
							for a minor fraction needed for statistical and analytical purposes (including brand
							safety and fraud detection), which is stored for no more than 94 days.
The data regarding ad impressions and your interactions with the ad is kept as long
							as it is needed for statistical, settlement, and product development purposes, however
							in any case no longer than 2 years from its collection.
After the lapse of periods specified above, the data is truncated or effectively
							anonymized.
In any case, we promptly respond to data subject requests related to the execution
							of the right to be forgotten by deleting all personal data covered by a given request.

							decided provides adequate protection for personal data as referred to in Article 45 of
							the GDPR or to a recipient in the United States that has certified compliance with the
							EU–US Privacy Shield framework.
