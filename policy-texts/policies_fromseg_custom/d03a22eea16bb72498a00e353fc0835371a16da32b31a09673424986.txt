This Privacy Statement and the certification seal located above right confirms that Electronic Arts is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online.
To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our web sites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices.
As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB.
ESRB Privacy Online is a third-party seal provider whose mission is to protect consumers' online privacy and make the Internet a secure, reliable, and private place to share information and conduct business.
ESRB Privacy Online promotes and enforces established principles and guidelines for fair information practices that include requirements of full disclosure, notice, and informed consent.

Third Party Sites
If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, a link to America Online (AOL), or an Ad company, you will leave the Electronic Arts site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.
==========
Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, including AOL or other service providers, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Electronic Arts.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.
If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Electronic Arts site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.
What personal information is collected?
Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you on-line or off-line.
Electronic Arts only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during (1) contests (registration or claiming a prize), (2) warranty registration and/or during customer support or technical service requests, (3) player match up services, (4) registration for games or special game-specific event participation, (5) marketing surveys and email campaigns, (6) registration for membership on our sites, (7) when you order products from us online, or (8) when you request services from third party service providers on our site.

We do not require personal information to obtain access to any of our sites; however, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.
Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

A Special Note About Children
Electronic Arts encourages parents to spend time online with their children.
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet.
We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children.
==========
Therefore, with respect to children residing in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to Electronic Arts' online sites by children 12 years of age or under.
In order for children 12 years old and under in such jurisdictions to participate in online activities that require registration, we require prior written permission or other verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
In other jurisdictions, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may be required from a parent or guardian for children under 14 or 18 years of age.
==========
Upon registration, the appropriate permission form will be made available.
A copy of our permission form can be found at http://www.ea.com/global/legal/register_child_fax.jsp.
This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Electronic Arts by fax or mail to the Privacy Policy Administrator in the relevant country.

Children 12 and under may not participate on certain of our sites.
In some cases, we may not permit children under 14 or 18 years of age to participate in certain of our sites.
Once we have obtained parental consent, we only ask the child for personally identifiable information that is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in our online activities.
If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personally identifiable information maintained by Electronic Arts is not correct or complete, or should you wish to have your child's name removed from our records, please contact your Privacy Policy Administrator who will be happy to review, update or remove your child's information as appropriate.
