BabyCenter LLC Privacy Policy




Privacy Policy
Introduction and Scope
In this Privacy Policy, we (BabyCenter, L.L.C., headquartered in San Francisco, California) describe how we use personally identifiable information about you that we collect through webpages at BabyCenter.com, ParentCenter.com, and pregnancy.com that display a direct link to this Privacy Policy (the "Site").
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other data, including, without limitation, data that we collect offline or data that others collect on websites that are linked to the Site.
About Children
This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this Site from visitors in this age group.
We do, however, collect information about children and babies from their parents.
We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child without first getting the parents' consent.
We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites.
==========
Types of Data We Collect; Collection Methods; Combination of Data
You actively send information to us when you sign up with us a member, participate in surveys or promotions, make purchases in our online store, post opinions on our bulletin boards, respond to us or otherwise contact us.
Depending on your choices, you may send us personally identifiable information such as your email address, name, mailing address, phone number, birthday, and gender; password; baby due date/birthday, name and gender; and sales delivery, billing and credit card information.
But, you can also use certain features of our Site without telling us your name and if you do not tell us who you are, we do not try to find out (even though that may be theoretically possible)
We also track information about how our Site is used by you through cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream — for more information click here ).
Also, your Internet browser automatically transmits to us information such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using.
You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but certain features of this Site might not work without cookies.
==========
If you have actively sent us your name or other personally identifiable information, we may combine such information with tracked information.
Purposes of Data Collection
We collect information about you because we want to determine what you may like or find interesting, so we can provide you with targeted information and advertising  (on our Site, in newsletters, via email and otherwise).
In our online store, we also collect information to process your orders.
We use redacted (anonymous) data to create statistics and reports for various business purposes.

==========
Disclosure of Data
We keep your personally identifiable information confidential and we generally do not disclose it.
But, please note the following clarifications and exceptions:

Our employees and independent contractors have access to some of your personally identifiable information for the purpose of helping us run our business (and not for their own purposes).
They access and use such data subject to our instructions, on a "need to know" basis and under confidentiality and security obligations.

==========
If we ever sell this Site or substantial parts of our business, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to a (prospective) buyer on the condition that such buyer agrees to comply with this Privacy Policy.
We may also share your personally identifiable information to respond to law enforcement requests, court orders or other legal process or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or respond to illegal activities, fraud, physical threats to you or others or as otherwise required by any applicable law or regulation.
Even though we do not provide any personally identifiable information about you specifically to any advertising customers, they can occasionally find out information indirectly.
For example, we frequently agree on target audiences for particular ads (for example, an advertiser may ask us to send certain information on infant safety products to parents with small children who may be particularly interested).
If you choose to respond to such targeted advertisements, the advertiser may deduct that you are a member of the target audience to whom we sent the ad.
==========
If you sign up for our services on a third party website, such third party may know — from you — that you signed up for BabyCenter.
Before we disclose your personally identifiable data for other reasons (such as a survey or a sweepstake), we will first obtain your consent, for example via email, click-through, an online opportunity to opt-out or otherwise.
We may share data with affiliated companies.
We freely use and disclose data in anonymous form, for example, in statistics or reports to our advertising customers.
If you post any information in public areas of our Site, such as chat rooms and message boards, it will be available to the public and we may reuse and republish such information at our discretion.
Security
We take reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
But, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.
In particular, e-mail sent to or from this Site may not be secure.
Access and Correction; Comments and Questions
Please keep your personally identifiable information, accurate, current, and complete by routinely updating your user profile.
If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at BabyCenter, L.L.C., Attention: Chief Privacy Officer, 163 Freelon St., San Francisco, CA 94107, http://www.babycenter.com/help-contactus.
==========
Opt-Out, Communication Preferences
You may modify your communication preferences and/or opt-out from specific communications at any time.
Please specify and adjust your preferences here.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective August 16, 2007.
We reserve the right to amend it from time to time and if we change it materially, we will post a revised version on this Site.
Please check back periodically, and especially before you provide any personally identifiable information to us.
