(a) our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with the terms of use of our website which you accept by browsing our website and/or to comply with any contract to provide services to or receive services from you or your employer); or

(c) where neither (a) nor (b) apply, use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others.
Our legitimate interests are to:

(ii) provide our services to clients, make and receive payment and provide client services

We do not deem this legitimate interest to be detrimental to you; we believe that it is in your interest to receive marketing content which is tailored to you interests.
If we rely on our (or another person’s) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information.
You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details at section 12.
