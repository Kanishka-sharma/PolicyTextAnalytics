Social Security OnlinePrivacy Policy
The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to the Social Security Administration.
In fact our first regulation, published in 1937, was written and published to ensure your privacy.
Our concern for your privacy is no different in the electronic age.

Why Does SSA Use Cookies?
In the case of our searchable FAQ database, the cookie helps us remember you if you request to be notified of a change of a question.
If you choose to disable cookies, you may still request that you be notified when a question is changed, but you will be required to enter your email address for every question you wish to be notified about.
==========
The cookie will expire 30 minutes after the last time the cookie was modified.
This expiration time does not delete the cookie from your PC, but it does make it invalid and we can no longer use that cookie.
No other web site can use this cookie under any circumstances.
If you wish to delete this (or any cookie), that is a function of your web browser and you should consult the software's Help files.
