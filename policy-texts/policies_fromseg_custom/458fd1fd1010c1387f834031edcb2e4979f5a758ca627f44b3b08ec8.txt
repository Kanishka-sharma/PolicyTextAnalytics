compliant with the Open Source Initiative ("OSI")'s Open Source Definition (http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd) and
certified as an "OSI-Approved License" (http://opensource.org/licenses).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, once you have selected the OSI-Approved License applicable to your Code, SourceForge shall be a licensee of such Code under the applicable OSI-Approved License that you have chosen.
You shall promptly notify SourceForge in writing if you do not have the right to grant SourceForge or any other user an OSI-Approved License to your Code.
