What does this privacy policy cover?
TripleLift values your privacy.

This privacy policy currently covers cookies belonging to TripleLift’s advertising domains (including adpinr.com, betrpin.com, and 3lift.

com), as well as to triplelift.com.
What does TripleLift know about me?
TripleLift works with advertisers and publishers.
Our aim is to deliver more engaging, interactive content.
The advertising domains sometimes deliver cookies with an advertisement, and publisher solutions sometime deliver cookies upon certain engagement points.
==========
We do not know who you are.
We don’t even have room in our database to store who you are.
This means we don’t know your name, your profession, your IQ, your cat’s name, who you crushed on in 6th grade or anything like that.
==========
We may know if you’ve seen one of our ads, if you’ve clicked on them or ended up purchasing something as part of clicking on the advertisement – but this information is completely anonymous.
That said, if you buy something from a site we work with, we do not and cannot tie back the information from the purchase (your name, your address, your credit card information) to you – we never and cannot get this personal information.
That stays with the advertiser or publisher.
==========
We do not collect personally identifiable information.
All cookie data is anonymous and no effort is taken to tie this information to names, birthdates, usernames of any sort, etc.
