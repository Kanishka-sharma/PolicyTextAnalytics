        caution in creating Your Profile as such information will be publicly viewable by
        others, including but not limited to other Users, and the Customer.
Administrators may add a User to a group of Users
        (“Group”) and assign the group a name.
Any authorized Users of a
        Customer can view such Group name and the Users assigned to such Group.
==========
When Administrators and/or Users sign up to use the
        UFB Service, We will assign a unique identifying number ("ID Number”) which may

        import courses, select certain courses, export certain Course Information, manage
        permissions such as administrative rights, and run reports on the UFB Service.
These
        choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or
        deletion of certain information.
You can always choose not to provide certain
        information to Us but You may not be able to use certain features of the UFB Service.
If You do not wish to receive promotional communications from Us, You can opt- out by:
        (i) following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional communication

How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Signals

        Because consumers are often unaware that their
        do-not- track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual
        preferences of Our Users.
Accordingly, Udemy does not respond to the federal do-not-
        track signal.
If You would like to not receive promotional communication from Udemy,
        You are free to follow the procedure described in the previous section to
        unsubscribe.

Udemy for Business Cookies Policy
Effective Date: March
        8, 2017
    

What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer
        or device as you browse the Internet.
Cookies can be used to collect, store and share
        bits of information about your activities across websites and services, including on
        the UFB Service.
They also allow us to remember things about your visit to the
        UFB Service, such as your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally
        make the site easier for you to use.
==========
Udemy uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.
A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to the UFB Service.
These
        cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using the
        UFB Service.
We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session,
        such as when you log into the UFB Service.
A persistent cookie will remain on your
        devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie.
We use these cookies where we
        need to identify you over a longer period of time.
==========
For example, we would use a
        persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.
Why does Udemy use cookies and similar
            technologies?
Udemy uses cookies and similar technologies, such as
        web beacons, browser cookies, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash
        cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways.
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information
        through other methods.
==========
We use cookies for the following purposes:
    

Authentication and security:


To log you into the UFB Service;
To protect your security; and
To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and
            other activities that violate Udemy’s agreements and terms.
For example, these technologies help authenticate your
        access to the UFB Service and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your
        accounts.
Preferences:


To remember information about your browser and your
            preferences; and
        
To remember your settings and other choices
            you have made.
For example, cookies help us remember your preferred
        language or the country that you are in.
We can then provide you with content in your
        preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit the UFB
        Service.
Analytics and research:


To help us improve and understand how people use the UFB Service.
For example, cookies help us test different versions of
        the UFB Service to see which particular features or content users prefer.
==========
We may
        include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message
        has been opened and for other analytics.
We might also optimize and improve your
        experience on the UFB Service by using cookies to see how you interact with the UFB
        Service, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click
        on.
To help us better understand how people use the UFB Service, we
        work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics and Mixpanel.
These providers use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users
        use the Services, including by noting the third-party Services from which you arrive.
The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these
        service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the UFB Service.
To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may
        install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by clicking here, and you may also use
        Mixpanel’s opt out by clicking here.
We don’t release the information collected from
        our own cookies to any third parties, other than to our service providers who assist us
        in these cookie activities.
==========
Personalized content:


To customize the UFB Service with more relevant content.
Advertising:


To provide you with more relevant advertising.
As explained further in our 
        Privacy Policy, third-parties whose products or services are
        accessible or advertised via the UFB Service may use cookies to collect information
        about your activities on the Services, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on.
This information may be used by them to serve ads that they believe are most likely to
        be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads.
Targeting and
        advertising cookies we use may include Google
        Analytics, AdRoll, AppNexus, and other advertising networks and
        services we use from time to time.
For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and
        how you can opt out, you can visit 
        youronlinechoices.eu or allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.
Please
        note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the UFB Service, you
        may still receive advertising content even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.
In that
        case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your
        interests.
==========
Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not
        responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
        availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
When accessing the UFB Service from a mobile
        application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.
Each
        operating system, such as iOS and Android, provides its own instructions on how to
        prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
You may review the
        support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in
        order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements.
For any other devices
        and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device
        or operating system or contact the applicable platform operator.
==========
What are my privacy options?
You have a number of options to control or limit how we
        and our partners use cookies.

            you know that we use cookies – by continuing to use or access the UFB Service,
            you are consenting to our use of cookies and related technologies as described in
            this Cookies Policy.

            may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the
            UFB Service.
Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and
            cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies.

            learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe
                website and make changes at the 
                Global Privacy Settings Panel.
