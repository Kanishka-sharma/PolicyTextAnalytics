Website Privacy Policy
The District of Columbia is committed to protecting the rights of all our visitors.
We recognize our obligation to keep personal information secure and have created this privacy statement to share our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.
Collection and Use of Online Information
Our web server automatically collects your IP address when you visit our site.
(Your IP address is your computer's unique address that lets other computers attached to the Internet know where to send data, but does not identify you individually).
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to compile statistics on site usage.
We do not make your IP address available to anyone outside of the District's technology staff.
To provide better service and a more effective website, sections of this site may use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser.
==========
A "cookie" is a small text file (typically only a few bytes) that we place on your hard drive in order to allow our server to identify your computer.
Our cookies will not attempt to read any information on your hard drive, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine your identity or your email address.
When you visit certain areas of this site, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information (such as name, address, gender, and, potentially, credit card number) that we need to process your request.
==========
In the event that you decline to provide such information, you limit our ability to serve you.
Still, we invite you to continue to visit the site and take advantage of the wealth of information it offers.
Secure Transmissions
Please be assured that this site has security measures in place to protect the information you provide us.
We use current encryption technology to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the personal information we gather, including your name, address and credit card number.

Access to Personal Information
Your personal information is available only to District employees who have a need to know and will not be available for public inspection without your prior consent.
Also, no site user information will be shared, sold or transferred to any third party without your prior consent.
Access is given only to those qualified professionals who are assigned the job of providing District services consistent with your interactions with our site.
Right to Inspect, Amend, or Correct Personal Records
Every site user who provides us with personal information has the right to inspect, amend, or correct their own personal information.
You may request to inspect your personal information by sending an email to webmaster@dc.gov.
