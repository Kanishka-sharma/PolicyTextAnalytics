Please read these Publisher Terms carefully.
1.
==========
Access to and Using the Services
Publisher’s use of the Services is subject to JustPremium’s approval of a JustPremium account (an “Account”).
JustPremium shall have  the right to refuse or limit Publisher’s access to the Services.
By enrolling in JustPremium’s Services, Publisher accepts the Agreement and permits JustPremium to serve advertisements and other content (“Ads”) to Publisher’s owned and operated websites, mobile applications, media players, mobile content, and/or other properties approved by JustPremium (“Publisher’s Advertising Inventory or Properties” together and each individually a “Property”) JustPremium may refuse to provide the Services to any Property for any reason.
Any Property that is a software application and accesses our Services may require preapproval by JustPremium in writing.
Publisher may use the Services only as permitted by the Agreement and any applicable laws.
Without limiting the foregoing, such use may not:
Interfere with the Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that JustPremium provides,
Impermissibly place a piece of code where an Ad is due to be displayed (“Ad Tags”) outside of or in addition to the positions and websites set forth in the applicable confirmation and instruction email sent by JustPremium to Publisher for an advertising campaign to be run on the Services (the “Authorized Positions”); JustPremium shall pay Publisher only for impressions that are delivered on the Authorized Positions,

If JustPremium does so, it will post the modified Publisher Terms on this page.
Continued use of the Services by Publisher thirty (30) days after any such changes have been made shall constitute consent to such changes.
==========

Publisher is responsible for regularly reviewing the most current version of these Publisher Terms, which are currently available at: http://justpremium.com/publisher-terms-US/.
When JustPremium changes these Publisher Terms, it will modify the “Last Modified” date above.
3.
==========
Revenue (share)
Subject to the requirements for payment set forth in this section, Publisher will receive a payment of the Net Revenue Share, on the net payment terms set forth in the MSA, related to the number of times an Ad is displayed on Publisher Properties (“Ad Impressions”).
Reporting related to Ad Impressions shall be made available to Publisher online.
Publisher acknowledges and accepts that JustPremium’s online reporting is an estimate and that the final measurements upon which Net Revenue payments are to be made may need to be adjusted at the end of each calendar month to account for, specific contractual provisions, statistical errors, and adjustments required by the purchasers of the Publisher Advertising Inventory.
JustPremium shall calculate the Net Revenue for which payment is due hereunder based solely on tracking of Ad Impressions (and related records and measurements) as compiled and maintained by JustPremium, related third party ad servers or the demand-side partners and participants utilizing the Services to place Ads on Publisher Properties.
In the event Publisher disputes the applicable tracking measurements and the amount in dispute is greater than 10% of the total Net Revenue for the applicable billing period, then the Parties will facilitate a reconciliation effort between two sets of server data and each party agrees to work in good faith to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days from the date the dispute arose.
JustPremium may withhold payment of the disputed amount(s) of the invoice, and shall remit to Publisher the undisputed amount(s) in a timely manner.
If the discrepancy cannot be resolved even though JustPremium has made a good faith effort to facilitate the reconciliation effort, JustPremium’s liability shall be no greater than 110% of the amount recorded by JustPremium’s measurements.
“Net Revenue Share” is the payment amount to Publisher based on the amount of revenue actually received by JustPremium for Ad Impressions served by JustPremium on Publisher’s Properties during the relevant calendar month as measured by JustPremium, net of value added taxes, other duties, associated third-party or governmental fees, revenue generated through Artificial Traffic, impressions, clicks or other invalid transactions or data fees.
JustPremium shall not be obliged to pay any Revenue Share to Publisher for any Ad Impressions or any other action which, pursuant to JustPremium reasonable assessment, may be: (i) based on Artificial Traffic, (ii) originating from Publisher’s IP addresses or computers or networks under Publisher’s control; or (iii) Ad Impressions for which JustPremium does not collect revenue from advertiser or party who initiated purchase for Publisher’s Advertising Inventory on the JustPremium Marketplace.
You acknowledge that any participation or attempted participation or violation of any of the foregoing is a material breach of the Agreement.
“Artificial Traffic” shall mean invalid, automated, deceptive or fraudulent Ad Impressions, which may, without limitation, be generated by or originating from any person or entity which may originate without limitation from automatic openings, spiders, robots, automated programs, browser toolbar, adware or spyware, requests in e-mail or chat rooms, or script generators.
==========
Unless otherwise agreed, in case the Parties have agreed on any prepayments or advances of the Revenue Share, such prepayment shall be set off against any Revenue Share accrued to Publisher under the Agreement until the prepayment has been fully recouped.
In case of expiry or termination of the Agreement prior to the full recoupment of the prepayment, Publisher shall repay to JustPremium the un-recouped amount of the prepayment immediately upon such expiry or termination.
4.
==========
Payments
JustPremium shall pay to Publisher the applicable Revenue Share according to the terms set forth in the Master Service Agreement, if the amount of outstanding receivables accumulated in or before the relevant month (“Balance”), is US $50 or more.
In the event that the Agreement is terminated, JustPremium shall pay Publisher any outstanding Revenue Share balance within 60 days from the termination of the Agreement, provided that JustPremium has collected the Net Revenue attributable to the applicable Publisher Revenue Share payments.
If such fees have not been collected by JustPremium within 60 days of the termination of the Agreement, it will make the outstanding Revenue Share payments for Publisher’s Advertising Inventory on the JustPremium platform payable to Publisher, within three business days of its receipt thereof.
==========
All amounts shall be payable in US Dollars unless agreed otherwise.
Before sending the Revenue Share payment, within 45 days from the end of the relevant billing period, JustPremium will provide Publisher with a statement setting forth the estimated Revenue Share to be paid.
Publisher acknowledges and agrees that such estimate is not binding and is subject to change, and that the actual Revenue Share payable to Publisher shall be finally determined only after JustPremium has collected the revenue attributable to the Ad Impressions delivered on Publisher’s Advertising Inventory through the JustPremium platform.
The agreed Revenue Share is exclusive of any taxes or other official duties, which may be deducted from the Revenue Share.
==========
Publisher agrees to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with its use of the JustPremium Service or receipt of the Revenue Share excluding JustPremium’s income taxes.
In case JustPremium has an obligation to pay withholding tax or other official charges based on the Revenue Share, JustPremium shall deduct corresponding amounts from actual payments made to Publisher.
Each Party shall be liable for its own applicable official charges as well as charges imposed by the bank or other credit institution engaged by the Party to send and receive payments under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of any doubt, JustPremium applies so-called shared bank charges to any payments under the Agreement, i.e. JustPremium is responsible only for the fees charged by JustPremium’s bank.
To ensure proper payment, Publisher is responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information in its Account.
5.
==========
Intellectual Property; Brand Features
Other than as set out expressly in the Agreement, neither Party will acquire any right, title or interest in any intellectual property rights belonging to the other party or to the other party’s licensors.
If JustPremium provides Publisher with tools in connection with the Services, it grants Publisher a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license for use of such tools.
This license is for the sole purpose of enabling Publisher to use the Services as provided by JustPremium, in the manner permitted by the Agreement.
JustPremium grants Publisher a non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable license to use JustPremium’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features (“Brand Features”) solely in connection with Publisher’s use of the Services and in accordance with the Agreement.
JustPremium may revoke this license at any time.
Any goodwill arising from Publisher’s use of JustPremium’s Brand Features will belong to, or as applicable, be assigned to JustPremium.
==========
Publisher may not copy, modify, distribute, translate, sell, or lease any part of the Services or included software, nor may it reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.
Publisher will not remove, obscure, or alter JustPremium’s copyright notice, Brand Features, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within any JustPremium services, software, or documentation.
Subject to prior written approval of Publisher, JustPremium may include Publisher’s name and Brand Features on its websites and in its presentations, documentation, marketing materials, customer lists and financial reports.
6.
==========
Privacy, Compliance and Data
Publisher and JustPremium agree to comply with all applicable laws, including but not limited to user privacy and data security laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, licenses, permits, judgments, decisions, and other requirements of any governmental authority including those related to privacy, consumer choice and opt-outs, cookies, personally identifiable information and data transfer and use.
Publisher further agrees to post conspicuously on each Property a privacy policy, linked, at a minimum, from such Property’s home page, that: (a) discloses Publisher’s privacy practices, including its use of a third party for its ad serving activities, (b) identifies the collection and use of information gathered in connection with both ad serving activities and delivery of the Publisher’s content including references to third party advertisers and service providers, (c) provides information on cookie use, device-specific information, location information and other information stored on, accessed on, or collected from end users’ devices in connection with the Services, including, as applicable, information about end users’ options for cookie management; and (d) provides the user or consumer with instructions as to opting out from such collection and/or provide for consent where such is required by law.
7.
==========
Confidentiality
Each Party acknowledges that during the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, it may disclose Confidential Information (as defined below) to the other Party.
“Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information relating to or disclosed in the course of the Agreement, which is or should be reasonably understood to be confidential.
Confidential Information may include, without limitation, business plans and proposals, projections, financial, sales, and marketing information, databases, drawings, designs, schematics, know-how, models, mock-ups, research, software programs, processes, customer lists, customer names, and any other personal or proprietary data or technology, procedure, or service under development by a Party or its clients, as well as all drafts, copies, summaries, and extracts of any Confidential Information, whether or not any of the foregoing information is so marked.
Confidential Information also includes information disclosed to a Party by third parties.
The receiving party agrees that it will not disclose any Confidential Information to anyone except an employee, agent, or advisor who has a need to know same, and who is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as are those in this section, and that it will not use Confidential Information for any purpose not permitted under this Agreement.
The receiving party will use the same care to protect Confidential Information as it uses for its own similar information but in no event less than reasonable care.
The receiving party will promptly return, provide a copy of, or destroy the other party’s Confidential Information upon request of the other party.
==========
Confidential Information does not include any information that (a) was already in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure to the receiving party; (b) becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the receiving party, without confidentiality restrictions, at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) was already in possession of the receiving party; or (d) was independently developed by the receiving party without violation of this Section.
If a receiving party is required to disclose Confidential Information under judicial or governmental order, the receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party, if legally permissible in order to allow such party to seek confidential treatment.
8.
==========
Term, Termination and Liquidated Damages
Term: The Term of the Agreement shall be as set forth in the Master Services Agreement (the “Term”).
Termination:
With the exception of pre-paid Agreements which shall be non-cancellable until all amounts pre-paid by JustPremium to Publisher have been fulfilled as delivered Ad Impressions.
Except as set forth above, either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon 24 hours notice to the other Party.
Publisher shall effect such termination by removing the relevant Ad Tags from its Properties.
==========
If Publisher breaches the Agreement or JustPremium suspends or terminates Publisher’s Account, Publisher will not be allowed to create a new Account.
In light of the difficulties in estimating the damages for an early termination of this Agreement or an applicable MSA for pre-payment Agreements, JustPremium and Publisher hereby agree that amounts pre-paid by JustPremium to Publisher that remain outstanding as of the early termination date (i.e. not fulfilled as Ad Impressions and therefore outstanding amounts Publisher owes to JustPremium), if any, shall be received by JustPremium as liquidated damages and not penalties and are in addition to all other rights of JustPremium.
The parties further acknowledge that (i) the amount of loss or damages likely to be incurred is incapable or is difficult to precisely estimate, (ii) the amounts specified in this subsection bear a reasonable relationship to, and are not plainly or grossly disproportionate to, the probable loss likely to be incurred by JustPremium in connection with such an early termination by Publisher.
9.
==========
Indemnification
Publisher’s Indemnities.
Publisher shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless JustPremium, from and against any loss, cost, expense, claim, injury or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), incurred due to third party claims, arising or resulting from or caused by (a) any grossly negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of Publisher; or (b) any material breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant by Publisher.

==========
Revenue (share)
Subject to the requirements for payment set forth in this section, Publisher will receive a payment of the Net Revenue Share, on the net payment terms set forth in the MSA, related to the number of times an Ad is displayed on Publisher Properties (“Ad Impressions”).
Reporting related to Ad Impressions shall be made available to Publisher online.
Publisher acknowledges and accepts that JustPremium’s online reporting is an estimate and that the final measurements upon which Net Revenue payments are to be made may need to be adjusted at the end of each calendar month to account for, specific contractual provisions, statistical errors, and adjustments required by the purchasers of the Publisher Advertising Inventory.
JustPremium shall calculate the Net Revenue for which payment is due hereunder based solely on tracking of Ad Impressions (and related records and measurements) as compiled and maintained by JustPremium, related third party ad servers or the demand-side partners and participants utilizing the Services to place Ads on Publisher Properties.
In the event Publisher disputes the applicable tracking measurements and the amount in dispute is greater than 10% of the total Net Revenue for the applicable billing period, then the Parties will facilitate a reconciliation effort between two sets of server data and each party agrees to work in good faith to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days from the date the dispute arose.
JustPremium may withhold payment of the disputed amount(s) of the invoice, and shall remit to Publisher the undisputed amount(s) in a timely manner.
If the discrepancy cannot be resolved even though JustPremium has made a good faith effort to facilitate the reconciliation effort, JustPremium’s liability shall be no greater than 110% of the amount recorded by JustPremium’s measurements.
“Net Revenue Share” is the payment amount to Publisher based on the amount of revenue actually received by JustPremium for Ad Impressions served by JustPremium on Publisher’s Properties during the relevant calendar month as measured by JustPremium, net of value added taxes, other duties, associated third-party or governmental fees, revenue generated through Artificial Traffic, impressions, clicks or other invalid transactions or data fees.
JustPremium shall not be obliged to pay any Revenue Share to Publisher for any Ad Impressions or any other action which, pursuant to JustPremium reasonable assessment, may be: (i) based on Artificial Traffic, (ii) originating from Publisher’s IP addresses or computers or networks under Publisher’s control; or (iii) Ad Impressions for which JustPremium does not collect revenue from advertiser or party who initiated purchase for Publisher’s Advertising Inventory on the JustPremium Marketplace.
You acknowledge that any participation or attempted participation or violation of any of the foregoing is a material breach of the Agreement.
“Artificial Traffic” shall mean invalid, automated, deceptive or fraudulent Ad Impressions, which may, without limitation, be generated by or originating from any person or entity which may originate without limitation from automatic openings, spiders, robots, automated programs, browser toolbar, adware or spyware, requests in e-mail or chat rooms, or script generators.
==========
Unless otherwise agreed, in case the Parties have agreed on any prepayments or advances of the Revenue Share, such prepayment shall be set off against any Revenue Share accrued to Publisher under the Agreement until the prepayment has been fully recouped.
In case of expiry or termination of the Agreement prior to the full recoupment of the prepayment, Publisher shall repay to JustPremium the un-recouped amount of the prepayment immediately upon such expiry or termination.
Payments
JustPremium shall pay to Publisher the applicable Revenue Share according to the terms set forth in the Master Service Agreement, if the amount of outstanding receivables accumulated in or before the relevant month (“Balance”), is EUR 50 or more.
In the event that the Agreement is terminated, JustPremium shall pay Publisher any outstanding Revenue Share balance within 60 days from the termination of the Agreement, provided that JustPremium has collected the Net Revenue attributable to the applicable Publisher Revenue Share payments.
If such fees have not been collected by JustPremium within 60 days of the termination of the Agreement, it will make the outstanding Revenue Share payments for Publisher’s Advertising Inventory on the JustPremium platform payable to Publisher, within three business days of its receipt thereof.
==========
All amounts shall be payable in Euros unless agreed otherwise.
Before sending the Revenue Share payment, within 45 days from the end of the relevant billing period, JustPremium will provide Publisher with a statement setting forth the estimated Revenue Share to be paid.
Publisher acknowledges and agrees that such estimate is not binding and is subject to change, and that the actual Revenue Share payable to Publisher shall be finally determined only after JustPremium has collected the revenue attributable to the Ad Impressions delivered on Publisher’s Advertising Inventory through the JustPremium platform.
The agreed Revenue Share is exclusive of any taxes or other official duties, which may be deducted from the Revenue Share.
==========
Publisher agrees to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with its use of the JustPremium Service or receipt of the Revenue Share excluding JustPremium’s income taxes.
In case JustPremium has an obligation to pay withholding tax or other official charges based on the Revenue Share, JustPremium shall deduct corresponding amounts from actual payments made to Publisher.
Each Party shall be liable for its own applicable official charges as well as charges imposed by the bank or other credit institution engaged by the Party to send and receive payments under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of any doubt, JustPremium applies so-called shared bank charges to any payments under the Agreement, i.e. JustPremium is responsible only for the fees charged by JustPremium’s bank.
To ensure proper payment, Publisher is responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information in its Account.
==========

Confidentiality
Each Party acknowledges that during the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, it may disclose Confidential Information (as defined below) to the other Party.

Confidential Information may include, without limitation, business plans and proposals, projections, financial, sales, and marketing information, databases, drawings, designs, schematics, know-how, models, mock-ups, research, software programs, processes, customer lists, customer names, and any other personal or proprietary data or technology, procedure, or service under development by a Party or its clients, as well as all drafts, copies, summaries, and extracts of any Confidential Information, whether or not any of the foregoing information is so marked.
Confidential Information also includes information disclosed to a Party by third parties.
The receiving party agrees that it will not disclose any Confidential Information to anyone except an employee, agent, or advisor who has a need to know same, and who is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as are those in this section, and that it will not use Confidential Information for any purpose not permitted under this Agreement.
The receiving party will use the same care to protect Confidential Information as it uses for its own similar information but in no event less than reasonable care.
The receiving party will promptly return, provide a copy of, or destroy the other party’s Confidential Information upon request of the other party.
Confidential Information does not include any information that (a) was already in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure to the receiving party; (b) becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the receiving party, without confidentiality restrictions, at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) was already in possession of the receiving party; or (d) was independently developed by the receiving party without violation of this Section.
If a receiving party is required to disclose Confidential Information under judicial or governmental order, the receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party, if legally permissible in order to allow such party to seek confidential treatment.
==========
Term, Termination and Liquidated Damages
 Term: The Term of the Agreement shall be as set forth in the Master Services Agreement (the “Term”).
Termination:
With the exception of pre-paid Agreements which shall be non-cancellable until all amounts pre-paid by JustPremium to Publisher have been fulfilled as delivered Ad Impressions.
Except as set forth above, either Party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon 24 hours notice to the other Party.
Publisher shall effect such termination by removing the relevant Ad Tags from its Properties.
==========
If Publisher breaches the Agreement or JustPremium suspends or terminates Publisher’s Account, Publisher will not be allowed to create a new Account.
In light of the difficulties in estimating the damages for an early termination of this Agreement or an applicable MSA for pre-payment Agreements, JustPremium and Publisher hereby agree that amounts pre-paid by JustPremium to Publisher that remain outstanding as of the early termination date (i.e. not fulfilled as Ad Impressions and therefore outstanding amounts Publisher owes to JustPremium), if any, shall be received by JustPremium as liquidated damages and not penalties and are in addition to all other rights of JustPremium.
The parties further acknowledge that (i) the amount of loss or damages likely to be incurred is incapable or is difficult to precisely estimate, (ii) the amounts specified in this subsection bear a reasonable relationship to, and are not plainly or grossly disproportionate to, the probable loss likely to be incurred by JustPremium in connection with such an early termination by Publisher.
