Privacy Across the SAP Network

					As a global company, SAP operates a number of Web sites around the world.
Any information that you submit to one of our sites in any one country or language may be sent electronically to a server for one of these sites in another country.
As such, the information may be used, stored, or processed outside the country where it was recorded.
However, we safeguard your data-security interests around the world by ensuring that this SAP site adheres to our international privacy principles described in this policy.

						path outside the SAP site.

						site may also use their own cookies.

						information, news or promotions, and to learn more about our Web visitors.

						details, check out the Choice/Opt-Out section below.
E-Mail Addresses

						If you give us your e-mail address, we will communicate with you via e-mail.

						of companies.

						details, check out the Choice/Opt-Out section below.
For the use of e-mail addresses 
						in connection with e-mail-based services, please see the paragraph "Registration 
						for Third-Party Services at mySAP.com" below.
Registration for Third-Party Services at mySAP.com

						At mySAP.com you can register for third-party services.
These services are available 
						through mySAP.com, but are provided by a third party, which is typically not 
						affiliated with SAP.
When you sign up for one of these services, it may be necessary 
						to transfer some of your mySAP.com registration information to this service 
						provider.
==========
Also, if the service you chose requires your e-mail address to fulfill 
						this service, we will give your e-mail address to the service provider.
This 
						means we will pass your e-mail address to a service provider 
						only
						in the event that you specifically asked for this service and the service cannot 
						be provided without your e-mail address.
For privacy practices and opt-out procedures 
						of those service providers, please refer to their privacy policies.

						is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient 
						know who sent the e-mail.
==========
The information is not used for any other purpose.
Shopping

==========

==========
Online Surveys

						From time to time, we may conduct online surveys.
Our surveys may ask you for

Online Security

						SAP wants your shopping experience to be simple and safe.
We support secure 
					  	online shopping using secure server technology.
The secure server technology 
					  	used in the SAP Store encrypts your personal financial information before it 
					  	is transmitted over the Internet.
That means information such as your name and 
					 	credit-card number is protected in a secret code until we receive them.
This 
					  	technology works best when the store site is viewed using a browser that supports 
					  	secure server technology.
If you select the option during your initial registration with the SAP Store 
					  	to allow us to store and remember your credit-card and related billing information 
					  	for future purchases, your credit-card number and passwords are stored in an 
					  	encrypted format.
==========

					  	at the point on our site where we request information from you.
