We require all cancellations to be done through the online form in order to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing that you are prepared for all of your files and emails to be removed, and (c) document the request.
This process aims to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and to ensure that you are aware that your files, emails, and account may be removed immediately and permanently after a cancellation request is processed.

Resource Usage
Shared Hosting
Acceptable Use Policy.
==========
Disk space is intended for use in accordance with HostGator’s Acceptable Use Policy and limited to web files, active email and User Website content only.
Shared hosting space may not be used for storage, including without limitation, of media, emails, as offsite storage of electronic files, or FTP hosts.
==========
HostGator expressly reserves the right to review every shared account for excessive usage of CPU, disk space and other resources that may be caused by a violation of this Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policy.
HostGator may, in its sole discretion, terminate access to the Services, apply additional fees, or remove or delete User Content for those accounts that are found to be in violation of HostGator's terms and conditions.
Excessive Server Resources.
Use of HostGator’s resources must be consistent with a shared hosting environment and must otherwise comply with this Agreement.
==========
Accounts with a large number of files (inode count in excess of 200,000) can have an adverse effect on server performance.
Similarly, accounts with an excessive number of database tables (in excess of 5000 database tables) or an excessive database size (in excess of 10GB total database usage or 5GB database usage in a single database) negatively affect the performance of the server.
In the event that you exceed these amounts, HostGator may request that you reduce the number of files/inodes, database tables, or total databases to ensure optimal server performance.
HostGator reserves the right to terminate your account, with or without notice, for excessive use of resources that result in a degradation of server performance or the Services.
==========
Bandwidth Usage.
With the exception of resellers, shared servers are not limited in their bandwidth allowance.
==========
Resellers are subject to the terms of the plan they purchased and usage information can be viewed in the control panel.
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Dedicated Servers Usage.
Dedicated and VPS usage is limited by the resources allocated to the specific plan you purchased.
==========
Uptime Guarantee.
If your shared or reseller server has a physical downtime that falls short of the 99.9% uptime guarantee, you may receive one (1) month of credit on your account.
This uptime guarantee does not apply to planned maintenance.
==========
Approval of any credit is at the sole discretion of HostGator and may be dependent upon the justification provided.
Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor's network capacity/transit availability.
The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services.
To request a credit, please contact our Billing department by calling 1-866-964-2867 or by using LiveChat with justification within thirty (30) days of the end of the month for which you are requesting a credit.
==========
Uptime guarantees only apply to shared and reseller solutions.
Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.
==========
