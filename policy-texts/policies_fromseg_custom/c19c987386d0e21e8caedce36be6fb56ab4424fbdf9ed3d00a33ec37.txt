Overview

                    IVO Media Ltd, herein referred to as “IVO” (“we”, “us” or “our”) is a creative management platform providing advertising technology that enables the design, production and delivery (“Services”) of advertisements on behalf of digital publishers and advertisers who buy media inventory for digital advertising campaigns, purchased directly or via their appointed media buying representative.
Once an advert has been bought, our Services allow the advertiser to serve ads to users browsing the internet, using mobile apps and similar placements of digital advertising media, for example outdoor digital display screens.
IVO, the digital publishers and the advertisers we work with are fully committed to preserving the privacy of users who see advertisements delivered by IVO.
The delivery and measurement of IVO adverts does not use cookies and does not provide user level targeting or reporting, we do not sell or buy media inventory and do not create or broker consumer profiles or audiences.
==========
Data held by IVO is in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018.
IVO is compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), details for Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) are provided within this policy.

The latest version of our Privacy Policy will be kept on this page and may be updated from time to time.

IVO’s Approach to Regulatory Compliance

                    To meet the standards for transparency and accountability for personal data uses under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) our administrative, technical and operational controls are designed to comply with regulatory requirements.
This includes safeguarding the data under our care using secure encryption technologies and ensuring Privacy by Design in our products on an ongoing basis.
A Data Privacy Officer (DPO) oversees our privacy and security compliance and can be contacted at privacy@ivo.io.
==========
Measurement Technologies used by the IVO Platform

                    The IVO platform uses various technologies including web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), web storage and similar technologies to provide anonymous aggregated measurement information in the context of an advertising campaign, including for example the number of viewings and clicks on an advert.
This helps indicate if an advert is effective for the advertiser.
Occasionally IVO adverts may include Google cookies on behalf of an advertiser.
Please refer to the Google privacy policy page for more details.
IVO may also work with third parties that collect data on other websites to serve you interest based ads.
==========
You can opt out of interest-based ads by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance opt out program here.
Non-cookie technologies can also be used to recognise your device in order to show you ads that are tailored to your context.
==========
The technologies IVO uses do not identify you as an individual.
For example, to show you an advert with the weather in your current non-specific location, your device might be identified, where permitted, through the IP address broadcast by your browser or device.
This information is not stored by IVO or used to identify you as an individual in any way.
