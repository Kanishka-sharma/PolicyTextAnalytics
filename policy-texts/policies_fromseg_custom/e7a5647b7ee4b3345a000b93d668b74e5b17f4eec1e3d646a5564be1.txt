Please see our Provisions for California Residents below for additional details regarding the categories of Personal Information collected, and how we use that information.
==========
Cookies.
Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC.
Websites typically use temporary cookies called “session“ cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within one website and that any information that you have entered is remembered.
For example, if an e-commerce website did not use session cookies, then items placed in a shopping basket would disappear by the time you reach the checkout.
Websites also use cookies called “persistent“ cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, thereby speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered.
To find out more about Cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.
==========
PetFlow® may install both persistent and session cookies when an end-user arrives at the Site.
Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the Site.
End-users have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their Internet browsers.
Visit the “help” portion of your Internet browser’s toolbar for more information.
If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the Site, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of the PetFlow® Offerings.
We reserve the right to retain Cookie data indefinitely.
==========
Server Statistics.
We collect general statistics to track end-user trends on our Site.
These statistics include hits to our server, the types of Internet browsers used to access our Site (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer), page views, navigational patterns, end-user IP addresses, the type of operating system that our end-users use (e.g., Windows or iOS) and the domain names of our end-users’ Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon, AT&T;).
==========
The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our end-users.
It helps us track “where” our end-users are coming from.
This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our end-users.
==========
We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of the PetFlow® Offerings and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.
We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze usage of the PetFlow® Offerings.
As part of that ongoing analysis, PetFlow® also uses devices called “web beacons” (also known as a “clear gifs” or a “pixel tags”).
These beacons/tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information.
We may use these beacons/tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of the Site and/or to help us identify when e-mails sent to you have been received and read, as applicable, and to provide information about what products/services are viewed or purchased.
==========
We reserve the right to retain this beacon/tag data indefinitely.

Behavioral Tracking.
PetFlow® uses cookies and other tracking technology on the Site for purposes of tracking end-users’ activities after they leave the Site.
PetFlow® uses these cookies to target applicable end-users with advertisements regarding the PetFlow® Offerings and other products and/or services that PetFlow® thinks may be of interest to applicable end-users.
In addition, third parties such as Google, Inc. may engage in a similar form of behavioral tracking of end-users that visit the Site.
User and event data associated with tracking technology utilized by Google, Inc., including cookies, user identifiers and advertising identifiers, will be retained by Google, Inc. for a period of up to fifty (50) months.
End-users may be able to disable some, but not all, of this tracking activity by utilizing the “Do Not Track” setting or similar options within most major Internet browsers.
To the greatest extent permissible under applicable law, we are not responsible for the tracking practices of third parties in connection with the Site.
==========
What Security Procedures Does PetFlow® Use to Protect Personal Information?
We endeavor to safeguard and protect our end-users’ Personal Information.
When end-users make Personal Information available to us, their Personal Information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any Personal Information offline).
Where our registration/application process prompts end-users to enter Sensitive Information, (such as medical information, driver’s license/ID card number, health insurance information, data collected from an automated license plate recognition system, Social Security Number and credit card information), and when we store and transmit such Sensitive Information, that information is encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security) technology.
Access to your Personal Information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your Personal Information is not accessible to the public.
All of our end-users’ Personal Information is restricted in our offices, as well as the offices of our third party service providers.
Only employees or third party agents who need Personal Information to perform a specific job are granted access to Personal Information.
Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all end-user Personal Information.
Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.
The servers that we store Personal Information on are kept in a secure physical environment.
We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Information under our control.
==========
Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet or via wireless networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your Personal Information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your Personal Information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software may constitute a crime punishable by law.
For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your Personal Information will be absolutely secure.
Any transmission of data at or through the Site, other PetFlow® Offerings or otherwise via the Internet or wireless network, is done at your own risk.
==========
In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Personal Information.
You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.
Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
==========
Will Petflow Disclose the Information it Collects to Outside Parties?
Please see our Provisions for California Residents below for additional details regarding how we share your Personal Information.
We may share your information, including Personal Information, to third parties, as set forth below:


Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions.

When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
==========
Advertisers: We may aggregate Personal Information with Personal Information of other users of the site, and disclose such information in a non-personally, or personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.
In these situations, we may disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.
