How We Share Personal Information As a global company, we endeavor to provide you with the same level of service that you have come to expect at Hilton whether you are in San Francisco, London or Tokyo.
To provide this service, we may share your personal information with other members of the Hilton Worldwide Portfolio of Brands, franchisees, managed hotels or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own.
Although the data protection laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, Hilton will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is handled as described in this Policy.
Hilton      Worldwide Portfolio of Brands: We may share personal information with other      companies within the Hilton Worldwide Portfolio of Brands that may jointly      use the personal information for the purposes described above.
Hilton Worldwide,      Inc. is the party responsible for the management of the jointly-used      personal information.
Franchised      Hotels, Managed Hotels, Timeshare and Fractional Resorts: We may share personal      information with owners and operators of franchised hotels, owners of hotels      that we manage but do not own, and timeshare or fractional ownership resorts      in order to provide you with services.

Business      Partners: From time to time we may partner with other companies to provide      products or services and may share your information with our business      partners to provide those products or services to you.
For example, we may      help to arrange rental car or other services from our business partners,      and share personal information with our business partners in order to      provide those services.
==========
We also may co-sponsor promotions, sweepstakes,      prize draws, competitions or contests with other companies or we may      provide prizes for sweepstakes and contests sponsored by other companies.
If you enter one of these sweepstakes or contests, we may share your      information with our co-sponsor or the third-party sponsor.
If you are an      HHonors member, we may share your personal information with our business      partners in order to credit you with mileage or other benefits earned      through your participation in the HHonors program.
Onsite      Services: We may share personal information with providers of onsite services      that provide services such as concierge services, spa treatments, golf, or      dining experiences.
Service      Providers: We rely on service providers to provide certain products and      services, such as to facilitate administrative functions and information      technology operations, credit card billing, reservations services,      administering the HHonors program, the Hilton Grand Vacations Club and The      Hilton Club program, providing services in connection with our websites,      including airline and rental car packages; communicating news and      delivering promotional and transactional materials via email and direct      mail; processing credit card transactions, data hygiene and enhancement      services; professional services such as accounting, auditing and legal      advice; investigating accident reports; processing insurance claims; and      administering sweepstakes, prize draws, competitions and customer surveys.

Business      Transactions: As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or      reorganize businesses or assets.
In the event of a merger, consolidation,      sale, liquidation or transfer of assets, Hilton may, in its sole and      absolute discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected,      including without limitation, non-personal information and personal      information, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.

Cookies and Other Technologies When you visit and interact with this site, Hilton and third parties with whom Hilton has contracted to provide services to Hilton, may collect non-personal information (for example, a catalog of the site pages you visit).
Our Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information  As with many other sites, our site may use "cookies" or other technologies to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your reservations or requests, and/or to analyze your visiting patterns.
==========
Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to disclose your individual identity.
This information identifies your browser, but not you, to our servers when you visit our site.
If you want to remove or block cookies at any time from your computer, you can update your browser settings (consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete or block cookies).
==========
We also may collect data by using "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "pixel tags") that allow us to know when you visit our site and to understand how you interact with our emails or advertisements.
Through pixel tags, we obtain non-personal information or aggregate information (i.e., the domain name, the areas of the site you visit, your operating system, your browser version, and the URL you came from) which can be used to enhance your online experience and understand traffic patterns.
Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use or disclose such information for any purpose.
In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information (such as embedding email addresses in cookies).
If we do combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
Our Vendors’ and Partners’ Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information We also work with vendors and other partners to help deliver online and mobile advertisements for our brands that we think may be of interest to you.
==========
Many of these advertisements are not targeted to you, but rather are placed on pages where we anticipate our target audience will visit frequently.
Our vendors and other partners also may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to perform services for us.
Hilton does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
These vendors and other partners include websites, online and mobile advertising networks and similar advertising service providers, and content networks.
These vendors and other partners may record which ads your browser has seen and which site pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered.
Some of our advertisements delivered for us by these vendors and other partners may be based on your online behaviors (e.g., on Hilton sites and other third party sites), your search activity, or your general geographic location (such as whether your Wi-Fi network indicates that you are in an airport).
==========
These ads may appear on our own sites or on third-party websites.
You may also see advertisements for third parties on other websites based on your visits to Hilton sites and other sites.
Also, if you search for a hotel reservation on a Hilton site, you may see an advertisement from a third party for a related or similar offer to that for which you were searching on the Hilton site.
==========
For example, if you have visited the home page or the booking page for one of our properties but not actually booked a room, or if you have searched for a specific term (such as location or dates of stay), our vendors, acting on our behalf, may deliver an advertisement to you for that property or based on that search term.
We also engage vendors to deliver online advertisements to consumers whose online behaviors on sites other than our own sites indicate that they may be interested in travel, or to help us deliver advertisements to consumers based on their publicly-available social networking information.
For example, if we know that you have stayed with us before, we may, through our vendors, deliver an online advertisement to you or your social networking friends.
Some of our vendors may use anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of our advertisements to you.
You may view a list of companies that collect or use information about your browsing activity to assess your ad interests, and opt-out of their use of your browsing activity to serve you interest-based ads, here.
Those companies are responsible for managing and honoring your opt-out choices, and Hilton is not responsible for their actions or policies.
