Security and Privacy
We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.
When we collect sensitive account information such as credit card numbers, we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information with third parties for their promotional use.
Occasionally, we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing customer service).
The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
We may also disclose certain information to partners who introduced you to Constant Contact's services.
Lastly, we may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law.

Cookies and Web Beacons
We use a variety of technologies on our sites.
Among these are cookies: a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember your browser in the future.

==========
When you visit our website, open our email, or encounter our services online (perhaps on a customer's website) we may send you a cookie.
Cookies may be used in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our website, track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs, and track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign.
Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, enabling us to make your visit to our website easier by recognizing you when you return and helping to provide you with a customized experience.
Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
==========

==========
Some of our web pages, emails, and other online content may contain electronic images known as web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images.
These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our web pages, seen our ads, or opened our email.
Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL).
==========
Flash cookies are also created by certain content on our pages using Adobe® Flash®, such as product tutorials.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.

When you click on a link in an email, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.
Web Beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page.
However, Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email.
If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.
==========
Online Advertising
We also use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.
These GIF files are provided by our ad management partners; they enable our partners to recognize a unique ad impression cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.
With both cookies and web beacons, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
==========
We give all internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving our ad impression cookie.
If you opt out, your web browser will be associated with a generic "opt-out" cookie, which will prevent us from associating any non-personally identifiable information with your browser.
Our "opt-out" cookie has no expiration date.
Keep in mind that participating in our opt-out program does not prevent you from seeing our online ads; instead, information about the online ads we serve to you will not be recorded.
If you wish to opt-out of receiving this cookie, please click here.
Our ad management partners include Mediaplex, Google, Advertising.com, 24/7 Real Media, Collective Media, Media6Degrees, TURN and DataXu.
