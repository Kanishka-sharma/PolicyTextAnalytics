We use this information to help ensure the security of your account.
Additionally, you have the option to provide demographic information (such as whether you are a college student age 18 to 23) and travel preferences to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site and deliver valuable travel offers.
If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards account, you can easily establish one as part of the registration process.
