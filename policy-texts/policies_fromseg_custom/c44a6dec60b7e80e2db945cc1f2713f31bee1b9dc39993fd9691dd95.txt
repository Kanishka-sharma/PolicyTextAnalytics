Privacy Policy
Navegg cares about and defends internet privacy.
We only collect anonymous information.
==========
We use technologies like cookies (small files stored by your browser), web beacons, or unique device identifiers to anonymously identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience.
Our systems also log information like your browser, operating system and IP address.
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you.
In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number or email address.
We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.
We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13.

==========
Navegg do not collect or store sensitive data and websites in the following categories: banks, religion, hospitals and clinics, government, justice, law, sex, products and content intended for adult audiences.
Our system analyzes the content visited by the user only in order to make sociodemographic inferences (purchase intent, gender, age etc.).
The browsing history of the user is not stored or redistributed – all information collected is summarized and analyzed in that way only.
We work with publishers of many kinds of contents so that users have a richer browsing experience, through relevant and non-intrusive advertising and personalized content.
We generally do not share personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other companies.
==========
To operate the service, we also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets.
Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.
==========
Our systems are designed to retain log data for up to 6 months after it is collected.
We remove personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email or phone number) and other preferences associated with your account promptly after you delete your account.
==========
We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
This includes utilizing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the personal information you input, and storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network.
However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.
Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.

We still do not have the NAI, Trustee and Digital Alliance certification because these organizations do not yet operate in Brazil.
Therefore, we are affiliated with the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) and we strictly follow all the good market practices.
