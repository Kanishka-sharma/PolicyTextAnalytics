==========
Overview and Important Definitions
This Terms of Use ("TOU" or the "Agreement") is a legally binding contract between SEOmoz, Inc. ("Moz") and you, as a user of or subscriber to Moz sites or services.
The Moz Privacy Policy and Moz Community Etiquette are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
Moz offers businesses and individuals access to a rich collection of resources related to search engine optimization, online marketing, and online local business listing management, including without limitation search engine optimization tools, link analysis tools, downloadable toolbars, application program interfaces ("APIs"), website profile services, search analytics, blogs, user-generated content, personalized content, industry surveys, and opinion polls.
==========
Collectively, we'll refer to these resources as the "Services" in this Agreement.
Moz Services may be offered across a number of web domains, including, without limitation, Moz.com and MozCast.com.
We'll refer to these domains as the "Sites" in this Agreement.
==========
You may access the Sites or Services with a free account as a user ("User").
While access to certain portions of the Sites and selected features of the Services is free, Moz reserves the right to charge fees for features and benefits associated with the Sites or Services at any time.
A User who pays for any portion of the Sites or Services shall be referred to as either a "Subscriber" or "Customer" in this Agreement.
Now that we've gotten these definitions out of the way, let's talk about terms specific to certain Services, followed by terms relevant to all Users, Subscribers and/or Customers.
==========
Conditions Governing API Usage.
Moz may offer APIs for use by third parties, such as the Mozscape API.
While Moz may not charge for Mozscape API use under certain circumstances, any such usage is subject to these TOU.
If Moz enters a separately negotiated agreement with you related to Mozscape API use, these terms will still apply, but any conflicting terms in that agreement will override terms in this Section II.
All data associated with such the Mozscape API is proprietary to Moz.
If you use or publicly display such proprietary data associated with this API, you must comply with any link and attribution guidelines set forth on the Sites from time to time in addition to this TOU.
==========
Moreover, you may not resell or redistribute Mozscape API data via your own API or offer it to third parties.
You may access the Mozscape API via a secret key only.
You agree to assume responsibility for your secret key, regardless of whether you authorized use of this key to another.
Mozscape API keys are limited to one per user and one per organization, and abusing Mozscape API keys may subject you to liability, including as described in this agreement.
Moz reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to any API at any time and for any reason, with or without cause.
If your access to an API is suspended or terminated, you have no rights associated with such API and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to any remuneration or compensation of any kind.
==========
Conditions Governing Moz Local Customers.
If you purchase business locations from Moz Local from any of the Sites, you are subject to the following terms and conditions related to your purchase.
If you purchase locations via a separately negotiated agreement, these terms also apply, but any conflicting terms in that agreement will override terms in this Section III.
Moz Local Service Fees: You agree to make an immediate payment to Moz for each location for a recurring one year term (the "Term") which begins on the date of payment.
This payment, plus any future payment for that location based on annual renewal, shall together be referred to as "Moz Local Service Fees".
You understand that Moz assumes costs immediately after you submit data to Moz and acknowledge that as a result no partial or complete refunds will be issued by Moz to you - at any time, for any reason - once you have made a payment for Moz Local Services.
Scope of Moz Local Services: In exchange for your immediate payment per business location per year and compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Moz will distribute data to certain location data aggregators and business listing services and may offer additional reports and tools related to this data.
These services are described in greater detail on the Sites.
Taxes: You are responsible for all taxes associated with your purchase of Moz Local Services (such as sales tax), and such taxes will be in addition to the Moz Local Service Fees quoted.
==========
Renewal: Each business location will renew annually within 30 days of the anniversary of the initial payment for that location.
Once a renewal payment is processed, no refunds will be provided for any reason.
If your renewal payment fails, you will no longer have any rights under this Agreement related to your previously purchased Moz Local business location(s), including the right to manage your listing, until you are in good payment standing.
Failure to renew a listing in a timely manner (prior to the date of annual renewal) will result in loss of custom pricing terms associated with a business location, if any.
==========
Change in Moz Local Serivce Fees Upon Renewal: Moz may change its Moz Local Service Fees from time to time, and with respect to renewals, Moz will provide no fewer than sixty (60) days of notice of such a change by electronic mail and/or posting of any new fee schedule on the Moz.com/local website.
Customer Management Of Each Business Location
Cancellation: You may cancel management of a business location from the Moz Local dashboard only.
Cancellation is immediate and is not reversible and must be initiated prior to the expiration of any Term to avoid fees associated with renewal.
==========
Cancellation removes a listing and its associated data from your dashboard.
Changes and Updates: You may make unlimited changes and updates to data associated with a purchased business location during the Term.
However, if you make changes to core data - such as domain name, phone number, or location address - that Moz is unable to validate using third-party services such as Google or Facebook, Moz may not be able to update your changes with location data aggregators and business listing services following submission.
This validation policy protects you and other customers from having business locations listing data hijacked by unauthorized agents.
Additional Moz Local Customer Obligations and Acknowledgements:
By purchasing Moz Local listings, you warrant and acknowledge that you own each listing or are otherwise authorized to represent the business location as of the date you make any payment of Moz Local Service Fees.
==========
You agree to review and confirm the accuracy of submitted information about a listing periodically throughout any Term.
You acknowledge that Moz may occasionally require you to submit proof of authorization to represent a Moz Local business location via email, and that failure to comply with such spot-checks may result in cancellation of your listing(s).
You acknowledge that your business location listing(s) may be transferred to another person or entity if that person or entity can reasonably demonstrate ownership of those business location(s), and this will not entitle you to a refund under any circumstances.
You acknowledge that another agent may submit information to Moz Local or a location listing provider which may override information you submitted about a business location.
You acknowledge that the services contemplated by this Agreement involve sending location data to third party location listing providers who will then have the right to use this data in any way they wish, and Moz has no control over this data once it is pushed to third parties.
You acknowledge that location data aggregators and business listing services are not obligated to accept your listing, or any or all of the information you submit via Moz Local related to a business location.
You acknowledge that Moz reserves the right to change the mix of Moz Local location data aggregators and business listing services in current and future Terms at our discretion.
Conditions Governing Moz Pro Subscribers
As a Moz Pro Subscriber, you must agree to the payment terms presented to you at the time you sign up for Services on the Sites.
You are responsible for taking action prior to renewal if you do not want your Moz Pro subscription to renew automatically.
==========
You might not receive further notice of your renewal after signing up for an account or subscription, and you must visit your Subscription and Billing page to find out when your account or subscription is set to renew.
Subscriptions recur either monthly or annually in most cases, depending upon the renewal term you choose during the signup process.
You are responsible for ensuring that the credit card associated with your account or subscription is up to date, that information posted in connection with it is accurate, and that you are authorized to use the credit card.
Moz reserves the right to implement fraud-protection measures including without limitation temporarily charging small amounts to your credit card to determine that it is a valid credit card and you are authorized to use it.
==========
Cancellation of Moz Pro Subscriptions.
For security reasons, an email or phone call to Moz is not sufficient to cancel your Moz account or Moz Pro subscription, which you may cancel at any time by selecting the cancel button on your Subscription and Billing page.
Cancellation does not entitle you to a refund under any circumstances.
You will continue to have access to the Sites and Services you have paid for until the end of your subscription term, but will lose access if the subscription is not in good standing.
No Refunds.
Moz is not obligated to provide you a refund at any time.
If you choose to cancel your Moz Pro subscription during your subscription term, you will not be refunded, in whole or in part.
If you choose to downgrade your subscription during your subscription term, you may be entitled to a pay a lower, pro-rated amount as of the date of renewal, but you are not entitled to a cash refund at any time.

When you post User Generated Content to the Sites, you authorize and direct Moz to make such copies as Moz deems necessary to facilitate the posting and storage of User Generated Content on the Sites and provide the Services to you.
You further authorize Moz to anonymize and aggregate User Generated Content, including data associated with your social media profiles.
You authorize Moz to use such content, by way of example and not limitation, for benchmarking, research and development, data products, or other marketing purposes.
By choosing to post, upload, or transmit data to the Sites, you grant Moz, its affiliates and partners an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty free, non-exclusive license (with the right to sub-license) to use anonymized and aggregated User Generated Content, in all present and future media, and in any manner relating to the Sites or Services.

Beta Features will be considered part of the Services and all provisions of this Agreement relating to the Services will apply to the Beta Features as well.
Users acknowledge that Beta Features may be untested, non-functional, and/or partially functional features of the Services.
If you elect to use a Beta Feature, you do so at your own risk.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Moz disclaims any and all warranties associated with any Beta Feature.
Any risk that Beta Features may harm or interrupt the regular running of your software or hardware is borne entirely by Users.
==========
Services Credits
Moz may from time to time offer opportunities to earn credits toward future Services ("Services Credits").
For example, Moz may offer Moz Pro Services Credits to a User or Subscriber if that User or Subscriber refers a customer who purchases a Moz Pro Subscription and remains in good standing.
These Services Credits are awarded at the discretion of Moz.
They may be revoked at any time, for any reason, at Moz's discretion.
==========
In no event shall credits ever be redeemable for cash, exchanged, sold, or rolled into a separate account.
Unused credits may expire at the discretion of Moz.
If, for example, Moz issues Services Credits for a referred account that is later deemed not to be an actual person or company, or the referred account is otherwise not in good standing, was fraudulently obtained, or later sought a refund for any payments associated with it, such Services Credits may be revoked and voided.
Moz may also undertake other actions (such as terminating your subscription or banning you from any future referral program) for such behavior at the reasonable discretion of Moz.

Users may have additional rights as a consumer under local law that this Agreement cannot change.
LIABILITY LIMITATION; EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR USERS
You acknowledge that Moz cannot provide the Services at a reasonable price without limiting its liability as set forth herein, so, as an express condition of use of the Sites or Services, you agree to limit Moz's potential liability to you as described in this clause.
This limitation of liability is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between Moz and you as a User.
==========
Moz does not: (i) guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information on the Sites or Services, or (ii) adopt, endorse or accept responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made by any party that appears on the Sites.

Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically acknowledge that Moz is not liable for the defamatory, offensive, infringing, breaching, fraudulent, or illegal conduct of other Users or third parties and that the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with you.
These limitations apply to any matter related to the Sites, Services or its content; third party Internet sites, programs or conduct; viruses or other disabling features; incompatibility between the Services and other services, software, or hardware; and any delay or failure in initiating, conducting, or completing any transmission or transaction in connection with the Services in an accurate or timely manner.
These limitations also apply even if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses, or fails its essential purpose; or even if Moz knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states, provinces and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to Users in these jurisdictions.
Special Admonitions for International Use
As a consequence of the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules and laws regarding user conduct on the Internet and acceptable content.
Specifically and without limitation, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding obscene and indecent content and communications and those regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.
