Eyeview Privacy Policy
Overview of Eyeview Services
At Eyeview Inc. (“Eyeview” or “we”, “us” or “our”), we understand that your privacy is important to you.
This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and disclose information collected through our web-based and mobile-based advertising services, as well as the Eyeview corporate websites.
The Eyeview advertising services are collectively referred to as the “Services.”
This policy does not apply to companies that Eyeview does not own or control or to people that Eyeview does not employ or manage.
For information about how we collect and use information through our corporate websites, including http://www.eyeviewdigital.com, please scroll down to the Section titled “PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR EYEVIEW CORPORATE WEBSITES.”
Eyeview offers services that are designed to help our customers, who are usually advertisers, but might be ad agencies, other ad platforms, or ad networks (“Customers”) deliver relevant content, emails, and tailored advertising and promotions, including those tailored to geographic areas.
If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you by Eyeview (whether through web or mobile delivery mechanisms), please follow the instructions in the “Your Choices” section below.
The Information We Collect and Use In Providing Our Services

We are able to provide more relevant content and targeted advertising by collecting certain information about you, including when you interact with our Services.
This may include your interactions with (a) our Customers and their advertisements, or (b) other web or mobile-based companies and marketing platforms, such as website content providers and mobile app developers, and platforms that aggregate their data (including Data Providers, as defined below).
==========
We may do this by using automated technologies such as cookies, including non-HTTP cookies, pixel tags, mobile identifiers and SDKs, each of which we describe below, and in the Section titled, “What are “cookies,” “pixel tags,” and “SDKs,” and how do we use them?”
We collect and use the following Information in providing our Services:

Information from marketing companies and other third party data providers (such as website content providers and mobile app developers, or other advertising platforms) (“Data Providers”) regarding their site visitors or app users, customers, or others.
This may include information about consumers’ actual or presumed demographics, interests or purchase behavior, as well as information about their interactions with websites and apps (including, for example, when they visited the pages, the content they viewed, and the links and ads that they clicked).
==========
Transactional information from our Customers.
Our Customers may provide us with non-personally identifiable information about you.
Log information.
When you visit a Customer’s or Data Provider’s website where our Services are deployed, our servers automatically record non-personally identifiable information that your browser sends.
These server logs include information such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer), the date and time, whether one of our cookies is already set on your browser, your browser type, the website (or mobile application) you are interacting with, and your interactions with our services, such as clicks on ads.
Your IP address provides us the ability to infer your geographic location information.
==========
Mobile data.
Through mobile applications on which our Services are deployed, including applications operated by our Customers, Data Providers (or companies that they receive information from), we likewise may collect information about your interactions with other applications (including your IP address and time-stamp information), and information about your mobile device (including device type, handset name, operating system information, mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID, app-specific identifiers, and a list of the applications your device interacts with).
The mobile information we collect or receive from our Data Providers and Customers also may include geolocation information, which may be precise, that may help us or our Customers to target ads or tailor content to your precise location.
For instance, if we believe that you are often near a particular store in Northern Jersey, we might send you an ad targeted to that store, rather than another store in the general area.
Other data collected via automated means.
==========
For more details, please see the section further below regarding cookies, pixel tags and SDKs.
We may use cookies, pixel tags, SDKs and similar technologies to collect the above information, or to associate certain types of information with each other.
How Do We Use and Share the Information We Collect?
==========
We may use this information to help Eyeview show personalized or other customized advertisements that are more likely to be relevant to you.
We also use the information to review the use of our Services and to improve them, as well as to develop new services.
For example, data collected about users may be used to create data segments that may then be used in our Services, such as to tailor advertising and content.
Thus, if you provide us information through our Services (including through our Data Providers or a Customer) that indicates to us that you enjoy movies, outdoors, we may then send ads regarding new movies or movie theaters in your area, matched to your browser or device (or a browser or device we believe may be yours).
Or, we may create data models that indicate that many users with similar attributes to you (such as geographic or interest-based) seem to like the outdoors – and we may then send them ads regarding outdoor gear or travel ideas, based on that same data model.
==========
Sometimes, we integrate our information with other platforms and partners, to allow advertisers to access our non-personally identifiable information, websites and mobile developers we have relationships with, or our Customers’ users, or in conjunction with other analytics or marketing services they provide.
This might be done, for instance, by “synching” anonymous identifiers, in order to permit anonymous data that we collect to be used by these platforms and their own customers.
Likewise, sometimes we may obtain from other platforms anonymous data they have collected, such as anonymous browser or mobile identifiers, and associated information; this process, too, may involve a sharing of unique, anonymous identifiers in order to create this “sync.”
We may do this to permit our own Customers to have access to this data, or to improve the accuracy of the information that we use and make available.
Sometimes,, we may use or make available the information we collect or receive to anonymously recognize unique users or try to resolve a commonality of users (or households) across platforms or across devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers.
For instance, we (or a Data Provider or Customer we work with) might infer that a common IP address seen across different devices represents a common user, and use that inference in tailoring ads.
We may share aggregated, non-personal, general information, such as how users interact with our or our Customers’ services, how many users clicked on or responded to a particular ad, or other aggregated, anonymous or averaged results relating to advertising campaigns and related Customer transactions.
This information does not identify you individually and cannot be used to contact you.
==========
What are “Cookies,” “Pixel Tags,” and “SDKs,” and How Do We Use Them?
Cookies.
Cookies are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier.
Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as anonymous tags that identify your device, but not you personally.
Our servers send your device a cookie when you visit or use a Customer or Data Provider website or mobile application.
==========
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.
When you access these web pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit and permit us to set or read our cookies.
Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to anonymously track the activity on a site by a particular device.
When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit.
We use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, track user trends, and collect information about how you use our Data Providers and Customer’s sites or interact with the advertising we deliver on their behalf .
We likewise use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.
==========
Disabling Cookies

Most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies.
You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies.
However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our services may be difficult to use or inoperable.
We work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than HTTP
cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services.
Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser
settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.

To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA’s opt-out program, please go to http://www.aboutads.info.
You may also go here to opt out of one such provider we may work with, or reset that provider’s advertising identifier.
(However, we make no representation about the accuracy or effectiveness of other providers’ opt out mechanisms.
Please review those providers’ websites, to learn how their tools operate.)
==========
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.
We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers or publisher-facing and app developer platforms that use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services.
A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon (see “Pixel Tags or Beacons” above).
The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
We may use this technology to deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.
