Commitment to Privacy Protection for Customers1
The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), doing business as FedLoan Servicing, is committed to safeguarding the individual privacy rights of all of its customers.
FedLoan Servicing strongly believes that it has a responsibility to protect from disclosure to unauthorized parties the nonpublic, personal information (e.g., name, address, date of birth, Social Security Number, etc.) of its customers.
FedLoan Servicing has adopted and implemented this privacy policy to protect your account and nonpublic personal information.

Section 2.
==========
Who is a FedLoan Servicing Customer?
This Privacy Policy applies only to a customer of FedLoan Servicing.
FedLoan Servicing customers are those individuals whose loans have been made or are owned by FedLoan Servicing.
Individuals whose loans have only been originated and/or are serviced by FedLoan Servicing for a lender or loan holder other than FedLoan Servicing are not FedLoan Servicing customers.
If your loans have been made or are owned by a lender other than FedLoan Servicing, you must review that lender's privacy policy, as that lender's privacy policy applies to you.

Section 3.
==========
Collection and Receipt of Nonpublic Personal Information
We may collect and receive nonpublic personal information about you.
This includes information such as your name, Social Security Number, birth date, assets, and income.
==========
We collect this information from the following sources:

Information we receive from you or your representative on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and other forms requesting financial aid;

Information received from credit reporting agencies and public records, used to verify your identity, to assess creditworthiness, or to better understand your need for products or services;

This would include the name of the domain and host from which the customer accessed the Internet; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer the customer is using to access a FedLoan Servicing website; the browser software the customer uses as well as the operating system; the date and time the customer accesses FedLoan Servicing websites; and the Internet address of the site from which the customer linked directly to FedLoan Servicing websites;
Information obtained by FedLoan Servicing via "session cookies" on its website to enhance the delivery of products, services, and information on FedLoan Servicing websites.
A cookie is a small file that FedLoan Servicing transfers to customers' computer hard drives.
Cookies also enable FedLoan Servicing to ensure that only a customer's web browser may exchange information regarding a customer's account with FedLoan Servicing servers.
Session cookies are temporary files that are erased when customers close all web browsers.
==========

FedLoan Servicing uses persistent cookies for customer protection, as part of its authentication technology.
Persistent cookies assist FedLoan Servicing in verifying the identity of a customer who is attempting to log in to his/her account.

Persistent cookies created by FedLoan Servicing do not contain any nonpublic personal information.
Information that may be obtained by FedLoan Servicing through use of HTML-encoding (sometimes called pixel tags or clear GIFS) to record aggregate information about FedLoan Servicing produced websites and e-mails.
HTML-encoding e-mail enables FedLoan Servicing to 1) send e-mail in a format certain customers may read, 2) to know which e-mails customers access and act upon, and 3) better target the content of future e-mails or web pages.
In addition, FedLoan Servicing may track the aggregate number of e-mails read and whether any of the links in the e-mails or web pages were accessed.

Section 4.
Notice and Disclosure
FedLoan Servicing may have a number of very different relationships with customers.
It is important to note that FedLoan Servicing may be required, depending upon its relationship with a customer, to share information about the customer with authorized third parties, as described in this Section.
==========
The United States Department of Education requires disclosure of individuals' Social Security Numbers on applications and other Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP") and Direct Loan Program documents, pursuant to published regulations.
For information on how the Department of Education treats the privacy of Social Security Numbers, please link to the following website to see the United States Department of Education's privacy policy: http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/secpriv.htm
In compliance with Department of Education requirements, and under our administration of FFELP and the Direct Loan Program, FedLoan Servicing similarly is required to collect and disclose the Social Security Numbers of applicants for loans under FFELP and the Direct Loan Program.
The primary use of this information is to verify applicant's identity, to determine program eligibility and benefits, to permit the servicing of financial aid, and to certify attendance and status at an approved higher education institution.
==========
The disclosure of this nonpublic personal information is mandatory for participation in FFELP or the Direct Loan Program.
FedLoan Servicing does not sell, trade, or disclose nonpublic personal information of its customers to any unauthorized third parties.
==========
However, FedLoan Servicing is required to share your information in the delivery of its financial products and services, in the following circumstances:
When you have authorized the disclosure of information in circumstances including but not limited to: certifications you have made on loan applications and promissory notes, the (FAFSA), and documents held by FedLoan Servicing and its partners such as schools, lenders, servicers, United States Department of Education, [including The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), which is the U.S. Department of Education's central database for student aid], and guarantors of customers' financial aid.
As noted in Section 2 above, when FedLoan Servicing acts as an originator and/or servicer of your loans, you do not become a FedLoan Servicing customer; instead, you remain the customer of the lender from whom you obtained your loan(s) or the entity that holds your loan(s).
In this instance, FedLoan Servicing will adhere to your lender's or loan holder's privacy policy.
When FedLoan Servicing needs to share your information to provide products or services that you requested; for example, as when an authorized credit check is performed.
When FedLoan Servicing is required to disclose your information by order of court or subpoena, pursuant to state, local, federal, or international statute, regulation or mandate, and in cooperation with law enforcement agencies.
==========
When FedLoan Servicing shares information with consumer reporting agencies.
Additionally, FedLoan Servicing sometimes shares information with other companies that perform services, or produce goods and products, which FedLoan Servicing does not.
For example, we sometimes use outside companies to print documents, prepare statements, to perform software programming, or to provide loan collection support.
==========
When outside companies are used, FedLoan Servicing provides them with only the information needed to perform that particular service.
Before representatives of the outside company receive such information, we require that they sign an agreement to keep all nonpublic personal or proprietary information confidential.
These outside companies may not use this information for their own purposes.
==========
In other instances, FedLoan Servicing contracts with non-affiliated third parties to market FedLoan Servicing products and services.
In such instances, your information may be shared with a non-affiliated third-party, which may market the FedLoan Servicing product to you.

Data Security
Securing customers' nonpublic personal information is very important to FedLoan Servicing.
Therefore, FedLoan Servicing has implemented several security measures to protect customers' personally identifying information from loss, misuse, or alteration.
When customers send personally identifying information to FedLoan Servicing via FedLoan Servicing websites, FedLoan Servicing requires that a secure session be established first, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
==========
During a SSL session, data passed back and forth between the customer's computer and FedLoan Servicing servers is secured through the use of public key cryptography.
The customer's computer exchanges key information with FedLoan Servicing servers to create a private conversation that only the customer's computer and FedLoan Servicing servers may understand.
To benefit from SSL technology, customers must use a browser with SSL capabilities.
==========
Please note that while using any FedLoan Servicing website, customers will be notified upon entering and leaving a secured session, unless the setting is turned off on the customer's browser.
After leaving a secured session, information transmitted to FedLoan Servicing is not secure.
==========
For security purposes, FedLoan Servicing uses special software programs to monitor website traffic and to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage to FedLoan Servicing websites.
These programs do not collect personally identifying information about customers, but do enable FedLoan Servicing to collect information allowing FedLoan Servicing to identify website users attempting to tamper with FedLoan Servicing websites.
FedLoan Servicing has policies in place against the misuse, misappropriation, unauthorized access, tampering, damage, destruction, or unlawful utilization of FedLoan Servicing websites and computer systems and will seek the maximum enforcement of state, federal, and international criminal laws against any individual engaging in such activity.

FedLoan Servicing may permanently record and store any substantive e-mail received from its customers.
Customer e-mail sent to FedLoan Servicing is not necessarily secure against interception.
Do not initiate communication with FedLoan Servicing by e-mail if your communication will include nonpublic personal information like your Social Security Number, bank account number, or other personally identifying information that you wish to protect.
