adsquare GmbH (“adsquare”) offers a targeting solution that makes advertising more relevant for consumers.
Our platform was built from day one with user privacy at the core of its design, works completely without cookies and has been awarded the ePrivacyseal certificate for best practice data processing.
This independent and internationally recognised seal of approval guarantees strict compliance with both German and European privacy laws.
==========
Let’s start with you, the user…
If you’re a user of an online or mobile website or application, adsquare may use your location and other device data in an anonymized and privacy-friendly way.
What we do not have access to and have no intention of knowing is any personal identifiable information (PII) such as your name, your address and any kind of location history information.
Therefore, adsquare may use pseudonymous identifiers associated with your mobile device and utilise hashing, encryption and de-identification techniques to help ensure your privacy is safeguarded.
We collect this information in order to ensure advertisers can provide you with relevant advertising based on your interests and local context.
==========
The aim of this is to effectively reduce the amount of ads you see that aren’t beneficial or of interest to you.
What information do we collect?
adsquare processes anonymous device and location information without using any tracking cookies or fingerprinting solution.
At adsquare, we fully respect each citizen’s right of informational self-determination and require our publishers and network partners to inform users about the use of geo-location and provide an opt-out option (for more details please review adsquare’s Terms and Conditions).
The core of adsquare’s platform uses geo-location transitioned into non-precise location context information as input for services that aim at increasing the delivery precision and effectiveness of ads.
In addition to this, the adsquare platform receives device information such as model, network operator, publisher etc. to build probabilistic audience segments.
None of the information (technical and all other information) submitted to adsquare is personally identifiable information (PII).
It is not possible for adsquare to identify individuals via the information collected by the adsquare platform.
How and why do we collect information?
==========
Location information and other above described technical information (device model, mobile network operator, etc.) is submitted to the adsquare platform via interfaces such as an application programming interface (“API”).
The information is collected in order to provide services that allow adsquare’s clients to increase relevancy and effectiveness of delivered ads.
What information does adsquare share with third parties?
The adsquare platform delivers probabilistic audience segments and other information describing location context and general statistical information to its customers.
adsquare does not own, share, rent or sell any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name or address.
How is information stored?
adsquare enforces generally accepted industry security standards on the adsquare platform to protect the information both during transmission and once it is received.
We do not store precise geo location data, meaning no location tracking or movement profiles.
adsquare works completely without cookies in compliance with both German and European privacy laws.
Opt-Out
Data is only processed in order to show you the most relevant advertising content.
==========
If you’re opposed to this, always read the terms and conditions when installing new apps.
