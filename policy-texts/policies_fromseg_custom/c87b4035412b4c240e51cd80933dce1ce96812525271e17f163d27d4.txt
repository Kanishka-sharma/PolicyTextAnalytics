        change your mind and opt back in to
        personal information sales at any time by contacting us
        as provided above.
You do not need to create an account with us to exercise
        your opt-out rights.

        within 45 days of its receipt.

        the reason and extension period in

        provide will only cover the 12-month period
        preceding the receipt date of the verifiable consumer
        request.
The response we provide will also
        explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
        applicable.
==========
For data portability
        requests, we will select a format to provide your
        personal information that is readily useable
        and should allow you to transmit the information from
        one entity to another entity without
        hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your
        verifiable consumer request unless it is
        excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we
        determine that the request warrants a fee,
        we will tell you why we made that decision and provide
        you with a cost estimate before
        completing your request.
