DataXu Global Privacy Policy
Last Updated April 2017
For guidance on how you can opt-out of the delivery of advertisements which are based on your information / browsing preferences, please see the section headed “Opting Out and Your Privacy Rights” below.
PART I. GENERAL INFORMATION
Our commitment to privacy
DataXu, Inc. (“DataXu,” “we“, “us” and “our“) firmly believes in the importance of online privacy.
To ensure that your privacy is protected and your information choices are respected, we have set out in this Privacy Policy an explanation of our privacy practices for our website, available at www.dataxu.com, and its sub-domains (“Website“), as well as our privacy practices for our marketing analytics platform (“Platform“).
==========
Introduction to DataXu
Advertising supports free content and experiences we all love on the web, social media platforms, and on Internet-enabled mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
DataXu’s goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to display content that may be of interest to you.
Relevant advertising is less annoying and assists the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective content.
To deliver relevant advertising to you, we may collect information about your activity across multiple third-party websites or mobile applications.
We may use this information to predict the types of ads that may interest you and to display advertising to you based on that information (“Interest-Based Advertising”).
For example, if you visit multiple websites that feature articles about travel or you use a travel app, we may display travel-related ads to you on another website or app.
To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising and your choices with respect to it, please visit www.aboutads.info/consumers, http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ and https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/.

PART II.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
What information do we collect via the Website?
We do not collect any information that enables us to determine your actual identity (“Personal Information“) before, during or after your visit to our Website, other than Personal Information you voluntarily supply to us (e.g. by submitting information on our “Contact Us” page or leaving a comment and your name on our blog).
When you provide Personal Information directly to us, it is used by DataXu solely for the purposes identified at the point at which you provide the information (e.g. for general marketing purposes or to notify you regarding updates to our products and services).
==========
Please see the “What Technologies Do We Deploy to Collect and Use Behavioral Information?”
section below for further information on our use of cookies on the Website.
What information do we collect via the Platform?
DataXu is committed to respecting your privacy in the provision of our Platform.
==========
In particular, DataXu is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI“) and complies with the 2015 NAI Code of Conduct and 2013 NAI Mobile Application Code.
DataXu also adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA“) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and related DAA guidance, as well as the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“EDAA“) principles.
Behavioral Information 
We use cookies and similar technologies (like pixels and statistical device identifiers) to collect information about your browser type, operating system, internet provider, IP address, domain name, the pages that you visit on third party websites, the actions that you take on those websites, the date and time of your visits to third party websites, whether you respond to an online ad and, where applicable for mobile users, device types, device make and model, operating system, mobile advertising identifiers (e.g. IDFA on iPhone, Google adID on Android), operating system device identifier, information about the types of apps you use and the GPS location of your device (subject to your provision of opt-in consent) (“Behavioral Information“).
==========
DataXu does not collect health information or create data segments that are based upon sensitive information and we adhere to the codes and principles of the NAI, DAA and EDAA with respect to such activities.
Outside of the European Economic Area, platform users may use general health-related segments which do not contain sensitive health data.

==========
Personal Information 
We do not collect Personal Information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Social Security Number, credit card information, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers or health related information.
We do not link or combine Personal Information with Behavioral Information.
We appreciate that, in certain jurisdictions, an IP address may be considered Personal Information.
As such, we take steps to ensure that the IP addresses which we process do not identify you.
==========
What information do our customers / partners collect via the Platform?
Sometimes our customers include their own (or their partners’) pixels or similar technologies within advertisements that DataXu serves to websites.
This is in order for our customers to set and read their own cookies (which are not subject to the control of DataXu).
In addition, if you visit a website or mobile application that uses the Platform, or click through an ad to the website or online service of one of our customers, those customers may collect additional information about your visit beyond the information described in this Privacy Policy.
They may also allow other companies (such as other ad networks or web analytics services) to collect information through mechanisms such as cookies, pixels and similar technologies.
DataXu is not responsible for and cannot control the data collection and use practices of its customers.
==========
You should read the privacy policies of the websites you visit and the online services and interactive ads that you use in order to understand the type of information companies collect and how they use that data.
How do we use Behavioral Information collected via the Platform?
We use Behavioral Information collected via the Platform for a variety of purposes, including to:

deliver advertisements to websites and mobile applications on behalf of advertisers;
enable our customers to determine which advertisement may be suitable to be delivered to you;
to monitor the success of and manage advertising campaigns; and
compile statistics, create reporting and analytics – all of which are done in the aggregate and without identifying you.
With whom do we share Behavioral Information collected via the Platform?
We may share and disclose Behavioral Information in the following circumstances:

Customers and customers’ partners – we may share Behavioral Information with our customers and customers’ partners for lawful advertising purposes;
Vendors, consultants and other service providers – we may share Behavioral Information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are working on our or our customers’ behalf and require access to such information to undertake that work e.g. to provide data storage and processing services;
Compliance with laws – we may disclose Behavioral Information to a third party where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
Vital interests and legal rights – we may disclose Behavioral Information where we believe it necessary in order to protect the vital interests of any person, or to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights; and
Business transfers – we may share or transfer Behavioral Information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
PART III.
==========
WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DO WE DEPLOY TO COLLECT AND USE BEHAVIORAL INFORMATION?
We use a variety of technologies on our Website and our Platform including cookies, pixel tags and scripts to collect and use Behavioral Information.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on your computer or device when you view an advertisement or website relating to one of our customers.
==========
The cookie does not contain any data that enables us to determine your actual identity.
Instead, we use cookies to determine how visits to a website and views of an advertisement.
DataXu cookies may be served from any of the following domains: dataxu.net, us.dataxu.net, www.w55c.net, cdn.w55c.net, tags.w55c.net, cti.w55c.net, cts.w55c.net, ads.w55c.net, and i.w55c.net.
For more information on our operation of these domains, click https://www.w55c.net/.
==========
To read more about our use of cookies, including how you can change your cookie preferences, please see our Cookie Policy available here.
Pixel tags
Pixel tags are small, invisible images on a webpage or other document.
Pixel tags allow the operator of the webpage or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read and modify cookies.
Our pixel tags allow DataXu cookies to be set, read and modified when you visit the websites of our partners.
Our pixel tags also allow our partners to better understand how you interact with their websites by observing which pages on their websites are visited.
Server to server technology with third parties
We may synchronize Behavioral Information with the behavioral information of third parties (including cross-device identifiers as described below).
We do not control the privacy practices of these third parties.
==========
Cross-device and cross-app technology
We and our customers may use technology that establishes deterministic or statistical connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising analytics and reporting purposes.
For example, DataXu or its partners may match your devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or web browsers, or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household.
This means that information about your use of websites or applications on your current device may be combined with information from your other devices.
This allows, for example, ads you see on your tablet to be based on activities you engaged in on your smartphone.
==========
We may partner with third parties to provide such cross-device technology to our customers, and we may share anonymous identifiers (such as cookies or your mobile device’s IDFA or Google adID) with those third parties to make connections among related devices.
We may also use your device’s IP address to infer connections among related devices within the same household.
To opt out of DataXu’s use of such technologies for each web browser and on each of your devices, please follow the instructions for Opting Out in both web browsers and mobile applications, as described in the Opting Out section below.
==========
We and our customers may collect information about your activity across multiple unaffiliated third-party mobile applications.
We may share this information with our customers to help them predict the types of ads that may interest you and to display advertising to you based on that information.
For example, if you use a travel app, we or our customers may display travel-related ads to you on another app.
We or our customers may combine this information with a mobile advertising identifier (such as your mobile device’s IDFA or Google adID), and we may retain it for up to 13 months, as described in the Security and Storage section below.
If you would like to opt out of Interest-Based Advertising practices in mobile applications, please follow the instructions in the Opting Out section below.
==========
Do Not Track (“DNT”)
DNT is a privacy preference that users may set in certain web browsers.
It is intended to allow users another method of informing websites and services that they do not want certain information about their website visits to be collected over time and across websites.
Our technology does not respond to “do not track” (a/k/a DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers or mobile device operating systems (including the “Limit Ad Tracking” feature in Apple iOS version 9 and earlier).
To learn more about how you can exercise choices about the collection and use of certain data online for purposes of Interest-Based Advertising, please see the Opting Out section below.
PART IV.
==========
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS AND SECURITY
Personal Information collected outside the United States, including in the European Economic Area (“EEA“), is transferred to and stored on our servers in the United States, the Netherlands and Singapore, and potentially in other countries whose data protection laws may be different to the laws in your country.
We will protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.
EU-US Privacy Shield
DataXu complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.
DataXu has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.
If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

DataXu’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles.
In particular, DataXu remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless DataXu proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
==========
In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, DataXu commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.
European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact DataXu directly at privacy@dataxu.com.
We will respond to your complaint within 45 days of receipt.
We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

==========
