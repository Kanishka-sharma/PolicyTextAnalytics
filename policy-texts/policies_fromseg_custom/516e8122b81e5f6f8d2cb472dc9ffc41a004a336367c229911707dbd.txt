C. COPPA 
The Department of Justice is especially concerned about protecting children’s   privacy.
We hope parents and teachers are involved in children’s Internet   explorations.
It is particularly important for parents to guide their children   when children are asked to provide personal information online.
The Department’s   Kids’ Page does not require children to reveal any information that could   personally identify them.
If a child chooses to provide personally identifying   information to us, through an e-mail or otherwise, it will only be used to   enable us to respond to the writer, and will not be retained.
