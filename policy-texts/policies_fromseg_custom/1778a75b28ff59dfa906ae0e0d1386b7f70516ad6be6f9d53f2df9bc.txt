Information we collect
Adimo Adimo never collects more than three different types of information from you, the user.
These are:


Usage data:
Usage data refers to how you interact with Adimo and is collected automatically on all users.
The aim of this is
to provide our third party clients (e.g. retailers and brand owners) with aggregated data to help them get a better
understanding of how users interact with Adimo, to learn things like which products are most frequently added to baskets.
Usage data is never personalised and cannot be tracked back to specific individuals.
Specific usage data we may collect is:

Information about how you interact with Adimo: how you are using Adimo, e.g. products clicked,
products added, total baskets added, retailer selected.
Browser information: browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions,
operating system and platform, location data, weblogs and other communication data and the resources
that you access.
This helps us to ensure that Adimo continues to provide an excellent user experience
across the majority of browser and device types.
Location based information: The IP address used to benefit from Adimo, e.g. the country, region, and
city from which a computer is connecting to the Internet.
==========
This may be used to provide the brand owners with
some knowledge about where you are using Adimo.
We are really keen to reassure you that the usage data we automatically collect about you is statistical
data about browsing actions and patterns, and will not be used in a way to identify you as individuals.
Account data:
Account data is only collected when you register and create an Adimo account.
The aim of Adimo accounts
is to streamline Adimo process and make it easier for you to quickly add the products you want without
needing to select a retailer or enter login details.
To do this we need to collect the following data from you:

Email address you use for your Adimo account;
Password you use for your Adimo account; and
Login details for retailer:

Preferred retailer;
Email address you use with your retailer account; and
Password you use with your retailer account.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you are able to provide us with such details and we can assume no liability for any breach by you of any of the retailers terms.
Contact Us Information
When you chat to us by telephone, email etc. or fill out a form on our website we will collect the
information that you give us at that time e.g. your name, email address or telephone number.

out sensitive information to anyone who claims to be Adimo or asked by us to obtain your
details from you.
==========
How we use your information

Data is a means to an end; the primary end being to
improve the services we provide.

to provide Adimo to you and to do any of the things we have undertaken.
or have,
(e.g. legal obligations) to do in order to provide BasketsAds as a result;
to ensure that Adimo is presented in the most effective manner for you and
whichever device you might be using;
to respond to you when they contact us and/or to deal with any feedback or any
other information given us when you contact us;

The people we pass it on to will depend on the type of data.
We may pass on Usage Data to:

any company that is a member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our
ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries; or
selected third parties including business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for
the performance of any contract we enter into with them; or
retailers with whom you have accounts with and which you have provided us with user names and passwords for; or
our clients who allow users to add products to their baskets through Adimo
unless you tell us in writing that you don’t want us to do that; or
advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve
relevant adverts to you and others.
==========
We do not disclose information about
identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate
information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged
under 30 have clicked on advertisements about their product on a given day).
We
may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of
audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1).
We may make use
of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our
advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
This
might involve us aggregating or summarising account data but we would never pass
on account data that would identify an individual user; or
a prospective buyer or investor and their professional advisers; or
anyone because of a legal duty or obligation upon us (e.g. the police, The Information
Commissioner or any other government body); or
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of Adimo.

people if we are legally required to do so.
