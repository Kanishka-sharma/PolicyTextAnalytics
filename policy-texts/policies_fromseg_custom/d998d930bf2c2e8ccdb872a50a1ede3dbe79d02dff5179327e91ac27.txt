Before Beginning: Your Personal Data In Nicequest

Your data does not belong to any company.
It belong to you.
==========
Therefore, you have the right to know what data we will ask you for and why.
At Nicequest, you'll be in charge.
You'll know what data you send us and what data you don't.
Thanks to the data from everyone who takes part in Nicequest, we create statistics on surveys and consumption.
==========
These statistics help other companies improve their services.
And since this information has a certain value, you deserve to receive something in exchange.
==========
Selling anonymous statistics is our only business model.
At Nicequest, we're not in the market of selling personal data.
==========
Or advertising.
Nicequest is an initiative of Soluciones Netquest de Investigaci√≥n S.L., a company founded in Barcelona in 2001.
==========
We're committed to every individual's right to data protection.
Nicequest is governed by the data protection rules of the European Union, which represent the world's highest standard on privacy.
==========
We believe in transparency, and next we'll tell you how we use the personal information you provide us.
Our Privacy Policy
Last updated: 27/03/2018
What does "personal information" mean?
==========
All information that you give us is personal, insofar as it is information related to you as a person.
However, what we call "personal information" is data that allows us to identify you unambiguously.
For example, it includes your email address, mailing address and your first and last names.
Why do you need my personal information?
We need it so we can communicate with you, so you can be a part of our community or so we can send you gifts when you request them.
What personal information will you ask of me?
==========
Your email address: We need this so you can create an account at Nicequest and we can communicate with you.
Your physical address: We need this so we can send you the gifts you request in exchange for your Shells.
Your full name: We like to address you personally.
Your phone number: We use this from time to time if you win a prize draw, if we notice a problem with a gift or to make sure that you actually took part in a survey.
==========
What data can you collect on me with your computer programs?
Computer programs allow us to automatically compile information on the devices that you're using without you having to do anything.
We collect this information to statistically enhance your consumer profile.
==========
For example: 

Your digital fingerprint: Our technology allows us to discover the "digital fingerprint" of the devices you use (PC, phone, etc.).
The "digital fingerprint" is a way to precisely identify a particular device.
This is how we prevent people from taking part more than once in prize draws, which would affect the results.
==========
Your image:  On some surveys, we'll ask for your permission for us (or our clients) to record your reactions to certain stimuli (music, advertisements, videos, etc.).
Your image will only be used for research purposes and will not be publicly disclosed.
The ID for your devices: Devices that you use to connect to the Internet usually have an internal code that identifies them.
It's like their license number.
==========
Knowing this code will allow us to cross-reference it with the information that other companies may have on your device.
For example, an advertising network.
In this way we know which ads you've seen on the Internet, so we can ask you for your opinion on them.
==========
Your basic profile on social networks:  To make registering for Nicequest easier and so you don't have to duplicate data from your profile, we'll ask you for your permission to take this information from a social network of your choice (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).
Your geographical position:  We'll use this to locate you on a map and find out the opinions and habits of people in your area.
==========
What is my "unique identifier" as a member?
This is a code that we assign to you when you register at Nicequest.
==========
It consists of a sequence of letters and numbers.
The unique identifier is unlike anything else in your personal information.
==========
Its purpose is specifically to identify you inside Nicequest, all the while protecting your identity from third parties.
It's useful in the internal organization of information and in the coordination with clients to whom we send the information that you provide us.
We always use your unique identifier to share your opinions on surveys with our clients.
==========
In this way we avoid revealing your personal data.
By accepting this privacy policy, you accept that we may share your unique identifier with our clients.
Will you link my responses to surveys with my real identity?
No.
We'll keep your responses to surveys linked to your unique identifier, but never to your identification data.
==========
This rule is known as "information disassociation": We and our clients are interested in your opinions and your behavior, which we anonymously add to that of many other members and in this way create general statistics.
It is not in our interest or that of our clients to link your opinion to your real identity.
==========
What is the Nicestats program?
It's an application that tracks your digital habits.
At Nicequest, we want to understand how people use the Internet.
That's why we've created Nicestats.
==========
If you participate in this special program, we'll send you instructions on how to install it on your devices (PC, phone or tablet).
Installation is voluntary, free, secure and will not affect your connection speed.
==========
The data that the Nicestats program compiles allows us to create statistics about how we interact on the Internet.
Specifically, the information that we store is: 

Information on the websites you visit and their content.
In particular, Nicestats will save the website addresses that you visit with your browser and their source code (HTML).
Information on which applications you use on your mobile devices.
Information on which words you enter into search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.).
Information on the on/off status of your devices.
==========
There are only two ways that we use the information:

To create statistics that help our clients make better decisions.
For example, if a website wants to know how many people visit and what their profiles are, it can offer them some more suitable contents.
To invite you to participate in specific surveys based on your browsing habits.
==========
It is not in our interest or that of our clients to link your Internet activity to your real identity.
Therefore, to protect your privacy, we've adopted the following measures: 

We separate your personal information from your browsing information: We'll deliver your digital behavior to our clients linked to your unique identifier as a member.
We anonymize your browsing data: sometimes the addresses for websites you visit contain data that could identify you, such as email addresses, usernames on social networks, etc.
This information is masked by our automatic algorithms prior to being sent to our clients.
Of course, if you'd prefer not to participate in Nicestats or uninstall the program, you'll keep your Nicequest account just like normal, and you'll keep on receiving invitations to participate in opinion surveys.
Can my personal data leave the country?
Yes.
The Internet is a global network.
==========
We're located in Barcelona (Spain), but our clients and suppliers are international companies located in different countries.
By accepting this privacy policy, you authorize us to possibly transfer your identifying data internationally to other countries.
==========
We guarantee that we'll only collaborate with companies that have an adequate level of security.
For example, our providers located in the US have been certified in the framework of the Privacy Shield program and are committed to protecting your data.
==========
Does Nicequest use cookies?
Yes, we use cookies at Nicequest to invite you to take part in surveys to evaluate ads.
If you want more information on which cookies we use and how to configure your cookie preferences, please check out our cookies policy.
With whom will you share my personal data?
We don't know how to do everything at Nicequest.
==========
Therefore, we sometimes need to hire suppliers that provide us with their services.
Some of these suppliers need to access your personal data.
Below are some examples: 

Logistics or gift providers that need your address to send you the gifts you request.
Suppliers of technical services including data hosting, email delivery, support tools, data validation and fraud prevention.
We also give access to affiliates of the Netquest Group.
==========
These companies will support in your own language and within your schedule, if you have any problems with a survey or a gift.
Is Soluciones Netquest part of a larger company?
==========
Yes, it is a part of the family of companies that make up the GfK group.
GfK is a German-based company that has specialized at studying consumers for over 75 years.
==========
GfK will have access to your sociodemographic profile, your device identifiers and the data compiled by Nicestats.
We'll share this data with GfK linked to your unique identifier, but not to your real identity (your email, physical address, etc.).
Just like us, GfK is a company solely dedicated to creating statistics and it is not in its interest to link your opinions or behavior to your real identity.
==========
In the particular case of data compiled by Nicestats, GfK is also committed to masking it before sharing it with third parties.
Can other members see my personal data?
No.
==========
Nicequest is not a social network.
Your personal data will be published only in two situations: 

If you win any of our prize draws, your name will be published under the "Prize Draws" section on our website.
If you decide to add a comment to rate any of our gifts, your comment will appear along with the alias you choose.
Is my information save securely?
Yes.
==========
Our team is committed to and trained in security and privacy.
Your data will be hosted on secure servers.
We apply technical and physical measures to responsibly protect your information.
If we fall prey to a cyber attack and your information is compromised, we'll communicate this to you within 72 hours.
Do you compile intimate or sensitive data?
Yes, sometimes we'll send you surveys related to your health or your political, religious or sexual preferences.
And the Nicestats program compiles all web pages that you visit, without making a distinction.
==========
Taking part is always voluntary.
We want you to feel comfortable.
==========
Our commitment is not to use your information in order to link it to you personally.
Our mission is to create statistics on the habits of the general population.
==========
Do you allow the participation of people underage?
Only people older than the age of 16 can participate in Nicequest.
How long will you hold onto my data for once I've left Nicequest?
Once you leave Nicequest (whether by expressly requesting such or by our decision), we'll keep your personal data indefinitely, only to ensure you don't register again.
==========
We will not use the data that we save and it will remain duly blocked.
How can I leave Nicequest or exercise my right to data protection?
You can leave Nicequest at any time by accessing our website using your email address and password, clicking on "Your Profile" and choosing the "Leave Nicequest" option.
We recognize and protect your rights of access, correction, cancellation and opposition in relation to your personal data.
You can exercise them by writing to privacy@netquest.com.
==========
How often will you change this privacy policy?
It is likely that we will need to change this privacy policy in the future to keep it updated.
If we do so, we are committed to publishing the change on the Nicequest.com website, our mobile application or in an email.
With the objective of being completely transparent, feel free to take a look at the previous versions of our Privacy Policy:
