This Children’s Educational Privacy Statement (“Statement”) describes the personal data we collect, use or disclose from students under the age of 18 when they receive educational services from schools and other organizations who are using Zoom Video Communication, Inc.’s (“Zoom”) meetings, webinars, or messaging platform (“Zoom Products”) to provide educational services to children.
This Statement supplements Zoom’s <Privacy Statement> and applies only if the account settings selected by a school or organization confirm that it provides educational services to children under 18.
What Personal Data Does Zoom Collect from Students?
Personal data is any information from or about an identified or identifiable person, including information that Zoom can associate with an individual person.
==========
We may collect, or process on behalf of schools or other organizations providing educational services, the following categories of personal data when a student uses or interacts with Zoom Products to receive educational services, such as when they join their classroom or meet with their teacher on Zoom:
 

Profile and Participant Information:  Name, profile picture, contact information, and any other information a school or educational organization allows students to add to their profile or to add when registering for meetings, recordings or webinars hosted on the school or organization’s account.
Contacts and Calendar Information:  Contact lists the school or educational service adds or allows students to use on their account (such as names and email addresses for other students in the school), as well as calendar information added to the account (such as a class schedule or upcoming school events).
==========
Settings:  Preferences and settings students set when using an educational account, such as microphone, audio and video settings, and screen sharing settings.
Device Information:  Information about the computers, phones, and other devices students use when joining meetings or webinars or sending messages using Zoom Products, including device features (like microphone or camera versions and IDs), IP address (which may be used to infer general location at a city or country level) and WiFi information.
==========
Meeting, Webinar, and Messaging Content:  If the school or educational organization chooses to record meetings or webinars to Zoom Cloud, Zoom will store these recordings on behalf of the school or organization.
The recordings may contain a student’s voice and image, messages, Q&A, or other content (such as a presentation or whiteboard) shared by a student during a meeting or webinar.
Zoom employees do not access this content unless the school or educational service directs us to do so, or as required for legal, security, or safety reasons.
==========
Product Usage:  Information about how students and their devices interact with Zoom Products, such as when they join and leave a meeting, whether they send messages and with whom they message, mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes, or actions (such as mute/unmute or video on/off), and other inputs that help Zoom understand feature usage, improve product design, and suggest features.
How Do We Use Student Personal Data?
Zoom uses personal data collected from students to conduct the following activities:

Provide Educational Products and Services:  To provide products, features and services for schools and other organizations to use when providing educational services to children, including to customize the product and safety features and settings for a school environment.
This may also include using personal data for customer support, which may include accessing audio, video, files, and messages, at the direction of the school or organization.
==========
Product Research and Development:  To develop, test, and improve Zoom Products that are used in educational settings.
Authentication, Integrity, Security, and Safety:  To authenticate accounts and activity, detect, investigate, and prevent malicious conduct or unsafe experiences, address security threats, protect school and public safety, and secure Zoom Products.
==========
Legal Reasons:  To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or government agencies, to investigate or participate in civil discovery, litigation, or other adversarial legal proceedings, and to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service or policies.
Zoom uses advanced tools to automatically scan content such as virtual backgrounds, profile images, and files uploaded or exchanged through chat, for the purpose of detecting and preventing violations of our terms or policies and illegal or other harmful activity, and its employees may investigate such content where required for legal, safety, or security reasons.
==========
How Do We Share Student Personal Data?
Zoom does not disclose student’s data to third parties, except for:

service providers who help us provide Zoom Products and technical infrastructure;
 where required for legal, security, or safety reasons;
 or to other Zoom affiliates (such as Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which provides Zoom Phone) to enable additional products and features for use by schools and educational organizations.
What Student Information Do Schools See and Share on Zoom Products?
Depending on their policies, settings and how they use Zoom Products to provide educational services, the school or organization providing educational services may be able to see or to share the following personal data from students who join meetings or webinars on their account.
The school or other organization’s use and disclosure of student information is subject to the school or educational organization’s policies, not Zoom’s.
Zoom does not enable children to make personal information publicly available through the use of Zoom Products.
Student Usage and Content:  Depending on their settings, the school or other organization providing educational services – and the people they designate — can access (i) information about how students and their devices interact with the school or educational organization’s account; (ii) information about the participants who joined classrooms or meetings on their account (including participant name, display name, email address and participant ID); (iii) the content of recordings hosted on their account, as well as a transcript of audio, if enabled; and (iv) information provided in response to polls, Q&A or other content shared during classrooms, webinars and meetings on their account.
Teachers, Hosts and Participants: Teachers, hosts and other participants in a classroom or meeting may be able to see students’ email, display name, and profile picture, as well as content and information shared by students during a meeting and webinar.
==========
Depending on settings implemented by the school or educational organization, teachers, hosts and participants also may be able to record or save classroom or meeting content, audio transcripts, messages sent to Everyone or to them directly, and files, whiteboards, or other information shared during a classroom or educational meeting.
Third-Party App: Schools or educational organizations may choose to install third-party apps to add features or educational services to their use of Zoom Products, including apps that may receive access to personal information about students and other users on their account.
Zoom does not pre-install any apps on educational accounts, and apps will not be able to access personal information from students receiving educational services on Zoom Products unless the school or educational organization chooses to approve a specific app.
Personal information shared by schools and educational organizations with third-party apps is subject to the school or organization’s policies and the app developers’ terms and privacy policies, not Zoom’s.
==========
In the United States, before choosing to install third party-apps that may be used by children under the age of 13, schools or educational organizations must obtain parent or guardian consent to the third-party app’s data practices.
By installing any third-party app, these schools or other educational organizations agree to obtain such parent or guardian consent and must consent themselves to the disclosure of students’ personal information to the third-party app when installing the app.
How to Review and Delete Student Information
A school or other educational organization may review and delete a student’s information, if in compliance with any applicable law, from their administrator dashboard.
If you are a parent or student, please contact your school or other educational organization to access any personal information, limit a student’s access to Zoom Products features or services, or delete personal information or the student’s entire profile.
A school or other educational organization may also take steps to prevent a student from receiving educational services through the use of Zoom Products on its account in the future, such as by deleting the student’s profile from the school or other educational organization’s account and limiting the student’s access to use of Zoom.
