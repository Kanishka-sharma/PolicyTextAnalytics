(“Dotdash”,  “we”, “us”, or “our”), to help you make informed decisions about how you share information when you visit or use the Sites.
This Privacy Policy only applies to properties we own and operate and does not cover any information collected via any other website, application, or service.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices of third parties.
By using the Sites, you explicitly agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Understanding How Information Is Collected:
Information You May Choose to Provide to Us
We may collect information, including personally identifiable information, from you if you choose to provide that information.
==========
For example, you may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up for our newsletters, participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions on the Sites, or apply for a job with Dotdash.
You also may choose to provide personally identifiable information about yourself when you participate in surveys, forums or discussions, or other Interactive Services on the Sites.
Please be aware that information you post may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Sites, therefore you should avoid posting sensitive or personal information that you would not want to be available to the public.
==========
Information That Is Automatically Collected 
When you access the Sites, we and our third-party partners and service providers may automatically collect certain information from your device or web-browser about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, and other data collecting and tracking technologies, to help us understand how our users use the Sites and to target advertising messages to you.
We and our third-party partners and service providers may also collect and track information about your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and devices using certain data matching techniques.
The information collected automatically when you visit the Sites may include your IP address, characteristics of your operating system, information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Sites, unique device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Sites), and other information that generally is not considered personally identifiable.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies 
Cookies are small files that many websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own devices or computers.
The Sites may use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local storage in order to provide useful features to our users.
==========
For more information about cookies, you may visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
See the section below regarding Your choices to learn more about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer.
If you choose to disable cookies, that could affect your ability to use certain features of the Sites that use cookies to enhance their functionality.
==========
To manage our automatic data collection, we, and our third-party partners and service providers, may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) and other tracking mechanisms on pages on the Sites, in videos, or in emails we send to you.
Web beacons are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.
We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, on the Sites to provide us with statistics and other information about visitors to the Sites.
Click here to learn more about Google Analytics and how you may opt out.
Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins that may appear on the Sites (for example, Facebook “Like” or “Share” buttons), also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features.
This information collection is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those third parties.
==========
“Do Not Track” Signals.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit.
At this time there is no consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track” in this context.
Like many other websites, the Sites are not configured to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.

We may combine the information we receive from those other (online and offline) sources with information we collect through the Sites.
Social Network and Platform Integration
The Sites may be integrated with social media networks and other platforms whereby information may be shared between us and those platforms.
For instance, if you interact with our Sites through a social media feature such as a plug-in, then you may be granting us on-going access to certain information from that social media account.
