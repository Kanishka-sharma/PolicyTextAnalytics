We reserve the right to remove any offensive or personally identifiable information that is posted.
Special Offers on the Site:These offers vary from day to day, but in general if you are interested in a particular offer you will be taken to a third party site to complete the transaction.
==========

==========
Credit Karma displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.
Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
Credit Karma does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad.
Credit Karma advertisers may include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as cable providers, airlines, wireless carriers and software companies).
Credit Karma may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.
==========
Such information does not identify you individually.
Service Providers:
We use other third parties to provide credit checks on our site.
When you sign up for a credit report on our site, we will share your personally identifiable information and sensitive information with the third party to verify your identity and provide that service.
These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing.
Marketing choices and access to your information:
    You can access and make changes to the personal information you submit, including your marketing preferences, at anytime by using the username and password you selected at the time of registration.
New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time, but we will require your consent and notice before marketing to you in this new way.
We give you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having personal information used.
==========
For example, you can elect not to receive newsletters or alert emails.
You can do this by logging into your account and visiting the "Account" page and you may also follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each email.
Special Offers and Updates:We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications by logging into your account and visiting the "account" page and by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.
Service-related Announcements:We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.
For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.

If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

==========
TerminationBecause Credit Karma is a financial services company, there are certain legal reporting and information retention requirements with which we must comply.

Use of cookies:
    Cookies are small text files created by a web site that store information on your computer, such as your preferences when visiting that site.
Credit Karma uses cookies when you sign in, to identify you and keep track of your personal session.
All this information is securely stored, and no personal information is stored on your cookie.
Credit Karma uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
Session ID cookies expire upon 30 minutes of inactivity or when you close your browser whichever is shorter.
We use a persistent cookie that remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, so that we can recognize you when you return to our web site.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file; however, because we use cookies for our sign-in functionality, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to log on to the Credit Karma web site.
Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers or tracking utility company) use cookies on our site.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
==========
Use of web beacons:
    We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better understand user interaction with our web site.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
==========
We do not tie Web beacons to personally identifiable information.
We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate  e.g. usage and volume statistics to enhance and improve our Web site.
Third party links:
    Credit Karma may post links to third party web sites that are not subject to this privacy policy.
==========
We do not exercise control over the external sites.
These sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
We urge you to review their privacy policy policies before providing them with any personal information.
==========
Access to Personally Identifiable Information:
    If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our "Account" page.
Protecting your information:
    Credit Karma maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information that we collect about you.
We enable our servers with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to establish a secure connection between your computer and our servers, creating a private session.
We employ firewalls and other security technologies to protect our servers from external attack and securely store your personal information.
We control access to this information via secure web pages, and limit access to only those employees or third parties on a need to know basis.
Credit Karma tests our systems regularly to insure that our security mechanisms are up to date.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
==========
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send an email to us at privacy@creditkarma.com

Children under 18:
Credit Karma services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18.
