  RETURN PATH PRIVACY STATEMENT
Effective: May 19, 2005

  Protecting your privacy is very important to Return Path.
==========
We know that you're concerned with privacy on the Internet, and we've taken many steps to help safeguard your information.
This privacy statement is provided to inform you of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected online and how that information is used.
By personal information we mean information about you collected through this Web site, including your email address, or any other information.
The organization collecting information at this Web site:
Return Path ("Company" or "we"), owns and operates the websites located at www.postmasterdirect.com (including its specific product related sites itprosdirect.com and smallbizownersdirect.com) and www.surveydirect.com (collectively, the "Site").
==========
Through the Site, Company operates the service Postmaster Direct (the "Service"), by which it delivers advertisements, surveys and offers by email to its "list members," that is, people who sign up for the Service through our opt-in process via our Site or through one of our many partners' sites.
The Company operates Survey Direct® on the Site, where we offer people opportunities to participate in marketing research surveys (the “Surveys”) conducted by various research companies.
Often, these marketing research companies offer incentives to participants in the Survey.
==========
Members who opt-in through Survey Direct® are signing up to receive survey invitations, not email advertisements.
The mailings may come from either Survey Direct® or the market research company
List members can unsubscribe from our Service or Survey at any time, no questions asked.
==========
We know that just because you joined a list a month ago doesn’t mean that you necessarily want to stay on it forever.
Every message we send on behalf of a marketer is coded with a special footer that allows you to remove your name from our lists and services automatically by clicking a link provided in the message.
==========
In addition, you can discontinue the Postmaster Direct Service, cancel your Survey Direct® membership or remove yourself from the lists you signed up for by following the instructions at our subscription review site.
To update your email address, you will need to unsubscribe the old email address and sign up your new email address through Postmaster Direct or Survey Direct® sign-up forms.
==========
We want our list members to feel comfortable using the Site and participating in the Service and Surveys, so we have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the Site, through the Service and through the Surveys and how we may use that information.
Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy.
By using the Site and participating in the Service or Surveys, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or participate in the Service or Surveys.
The information we collect: 
  Collection and Use
  To simply view the Site without registering for the Service or for the Surveys, you will not be required to provide any personal information.
However, to register for the Service or to participate in the Surveys, whether at our Site or at one of our partners’ sites, you are required to provide your email address.
To serve you better and send you the most relevant offers, we may also seek other personally and non-personally identifiable information about you from you, our marketing partners where you have given them your consent, or where such information is otherwise publicly available.
==========
Such information may include postal, demographic or profile data.
If you provide us with your email address or other personal information, or if we obtain such information about you from you or from one of our marketing partners, we will retain and use that information solely for the purpose of sending you advertisements, offers and Surveys from selected marketers in categories of interest to you.
When necessary, we may also use your personal information to ensure compliance with Company policies and applicable law.
In addition, if you participate in Survey Direct®, you will be asked to provide certain demographic data (like your age, gender, zip code, income) and profile data (like occupation, shopping habits and other areas of interest) as certain Surveys may be directed to those participants who meet a particular demographic profile.
==========
You will be asked to answer certain “pre-qualification” questions on a pre-qualification page hosted by us.
The information we collect on this page will be used to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the Survey and will also be maintained by us to enable us to provide you with more relevant Surveys in the future.
==========
The information provided may be used by the Service to provide you with better targeted messages if you are also a member of the Service.
Your answers to these pre-qualification questions will not be provided to the marketing research company conducting the Survey or to advertisers.
If you qualify for a particular Survey after answering questions on our pre-qualification page, you will be directed to the Survey itself, on pages hosted by the research company.
Note that any information you provide on the pages hosted by the research company and during the course of the Survey will be subject to the research company’s privacy policy, not ours.
==========
We also collect information on the "contact us" page and other areas of the site to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have.
This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments.
We may also file your comments to improve our site or services, or review and discard the information.
With whom it may be shared:
  Except for the limited situations discussed in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties.
==========
We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain specialized services such as merge/purge (to prevent you from receiving duplicate offers), offer hosting technology providers, and other data processing services to bring you more targeted offers.
In such instances, we may provide your personal information to those businesses but they are not permitted to retain or use your information for any other purpose.
==========
As the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets.
Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions.
Thus, in the event that Company or all of its assets are acquired, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets.
==========
In the event of corporate change, users will be notified in accordance with the “Changes to these terms” section of the policy if their personal information is provided to the new corporate entity as a result of corporate ownership change.
Finally, Company reserves the right to disclose list member information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Company’s rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
Company also reserves the right to disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
==========
Aggregate information: 
  From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on.
The Company also collects and reports aggregate statistical information on the open rates and response rates generated by the email campaigns we send.
We collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”, which are discussed in greater detail below.
We collect this information in order to determine what types of advertisements are of interest to list members and to therefore enhance the Service.
We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and Service to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request.
However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Site.
IP Addresses
  An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the web.
Web servers, the computers that “serve” web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
Company collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties and to track the use of the Site.
==========
When visitors request pages from the Site or click on a link in a mailing sent through the Service or through Survey Direct®, our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses.
We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor or list member when it will enhance the users experience or if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s policies or to protect Company, the Site, its visitors, the Service, Survey Direct®, the list members or others.
==========
Cookies
  Cookies are pieces of information that a websites transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you’re at the Site.

==========
By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not.

==========
Links to other sites: 
  Please be aware that when you are on the Site, or when you receive an email message from us on behalf of a marketer through the Service, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control, such as the marketer’s site.
And, as discussed above, if you qualify for a Survey on our pre-qualification page, you will be directed to the marketing research company’s site.
==========
There may be links to other sites from the Site’s pages or from the email message we send to you that take you outside our Site.
These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information.
The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.
Note that when you link to a third party site from the Site, you may see pre-populated data fields with your personal information; however, that information is not available to the third party unless you take certain actions on the third party’s site, such as submitting a form
Firewalls: 
  Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us.
When we store information that you have provided to us when registering for the Service, that information is protected by security measures that include “firewalls” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network), “intrusion detection systems” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps detect any unauthorized visitors) and other tools such as data encryption and physical security, where appropriate.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data repository can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while Company strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.
==========
Privacy policy for children:
  We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 on the Site, through the Service, or through Survey Direct®.
On partner sites where we collect age, or year of birth, we do not opt-in subscribers who indicate a year that states their age to be less than 13.
==========
If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any personal information to us.
If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
==========
Changes to these terms: 
  The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made, that this Privacy Policy has been updated, and by changing the “Effective” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.
Your continued use of the Site and participation in the Service or in any Surveys offered through Survey Direct® following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
