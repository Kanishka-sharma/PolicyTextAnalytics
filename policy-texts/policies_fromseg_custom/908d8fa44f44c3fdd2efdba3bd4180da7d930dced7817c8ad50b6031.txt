Web User Privacy Policy
This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices of iPromote.com.
Does iPromote Collect Any Personally Identifiable Information From Web Surfers?
No.
==========
We don’t collect or serve ads based on personally identifiable information.
This means all Web surfers who receive ads served by iPromote retain complete anonymity where iPromote is concerned.
As ads are served, iPromote does not collect any personal information about you.
Your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address all remain your private information.
Like most standard Web servers, iPromote collects data that is non-personally identifiable such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, referring pages, operating system types, and date/time stamps.
iPromote uses this non-personally identifiable data to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services.
==========
There are instances where a Web user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire.
For such programs, iPromote acquires this information on behalf of the Advertiser.
The Advertiser uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the user.
Any personal information that a user voluntarily provides to an Advertiser is subject to the privacy policy of that Advertiser.
We recommend that anytime you choose to voluntarily submit personal information online, you should first visit and review the privacy policy of that site.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Like most digital marketing solutions, iPromote uses “cookies” and other technologies to enhance users’ experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads, and for ad delivery and reporting.
==========
We cannot use these technologies to personally identify you, and these technologies do not damage your system or files.
iPromote uses these technologies to help recognize a unique computer or device so we are able to deliver relevant advertising and measure the impact of that advertising.
The types of technologies used include:

Cookies – Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters.
==========
iPromote uses cookies to change the sequence of the ad banners that are delivered to your web browser and to limit the number of times your web browser receives the same advertisement.
Cookies are also used by our reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad campaign, the number of times an ad is clicked on, and how many Web surfers visit an Advertiser's website.
Web Beacons – Web Beacons are used to help web publishers understand how visitors interact with their websites.
Pixel tags are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that are placed on a site.
The use of a pixel tag allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the tag.
iPromote uses cookies and pixel tags primarily to: (i) report to iPromote's advertiser and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign; (ii) report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user and other measurement statistics; (iii) ensure that an ad displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination; (iv) deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; (v) deliver advertisements that fall within certain categories such as sports, music, travel, food, etc.; and (vi) limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement.

iPromote firmly believes that every individual who uses the Internet should be able to make informed decisions with respect to individual privacy matters, including the use of cookies.

Children's Privacy and Spam
As of April 21, 2000 the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act became effective.
The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 12.
iPromote is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet.
iPromote's Web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children.
Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 18 to do business with us.
==========
If you believe your child has provided iPromote with any personally identifiable data by registering at iPromote's Web site, please e-mail us at privacy@ipromote.com to have the data removed.
We also request that all Web sites using our advertising network disclose in their privacy statements any and all information regarding the collection of information from children.
In addition to the above, iPromote is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 7701).

A Special Note About the European Union
European Union Web surfers understand and consent to the processing of personal information in the United States.
iPromote Clients
If you are a "client" of iPromote (i.e. an Advertiser or Web Publisher who has registered with iPromote to do business with iPromote) you are requested to provide personal information in order to participate in these programs.
The collection of this information is part of regular business practices and is necessary in order to complete transactions and properly run and administer these services.
Should anyone be uncomfortable providing this information to iPromote, they can choose not to participate.
Information collected during the registration or application processes, include: company name, name, e-mail, street address, and phone number.
Overall, Advertiser and Publisher information is used for administering the program, maintaining account information, and processing billing and payments.
==========
Security
iPromote takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information.
Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
(To learn more about SSL, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).
iPromote also has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs.
Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium.
Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our ad servers or Web site.
In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that iPromote, or part of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company.
If that's the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to our information.
