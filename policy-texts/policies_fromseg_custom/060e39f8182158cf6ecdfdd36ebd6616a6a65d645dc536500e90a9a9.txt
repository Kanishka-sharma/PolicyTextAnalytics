1.2 INTRODUCTION TO BRAZE
Braze is a U.S. company, headquartered in New York, with global operations.
A reference to “Braze,” “we,” “us” or the “Company” is a reference to Braze, Inc. and the relevant affiliate(s) involved in the processing activity.
==========
Braze is a life-cycle engagement platform for companies around the world, supporting stronger relationships between brands and their clients, primarily by leveraging first party data to personalize and automate life-cycle marketing campaigns through first party channels, such as email, SMS, mobile and web push notifications, and in-app/in-browser messaging.
More information about Braze can be found at www.braze.com.
Our Japanese website can be found at https://www.braze.co.jp/.
==========
1.3 SCOPE OF THIS POLICY
What is in Scope?
This Privacy Policy applies to Braze, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data for our recruitment, marketing or business purposes (further details below) and in such capacity, we will use the term “Data Controller”.
What is not in Scope?
==========
Braze’s privacy commitments to its customers, where we process personal data on behalf of our customers, are outlined in Braze’s agreements with such customers.
In our capacity as a processor of our customers’ data, we will refer to ourselves as a “Data Processor.”
Specifically, in that capacity, Braze processes personal data of people who interact with customer applications or websites that are offered by our customers and that have incorporated Braze technology (“Customer Applications”).
==========
The protections that apply to such personal data will be described in the individual privacy policies of those customers, and not in this Privacy Policy.
If you wish to learn more about the privacy and data security practices of those customers you should reach out to them directly.
For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not cover any personal data that our customers choose to collect and share with Braze, where Braze is not the Data Controller, but is instead a Data Processor.
Braze also hosts Braze Alloys, which is an online marketplace for on-demand web applications that are provided by third parties (see here).
Because the partners listed on Braze Alloys are third parties, this Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection or use of Personal Data.
==========
Additionally, our Websites or Services (as defined below) may contain links to other websites, applications and services maintained by third parties.
The privacy and data security practices of such third-party sites are governed by the privacy statements of those third parties, and not by Braze.
PART II.
==========

PART III.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION
3.1 PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE
Our Website servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate in the United States, Singapore, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.
==========
This means that when we collect your Personal Data, we may process it in any of these countries.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective), but we have in place appropriate safeguards and international transfer mechanisms (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses).
We also provide a number of supplementary measures designed to better protect the Personal Data that we are entrusted with.
==========
Notwithstanding the fact that it has been held to no longer provide a valid mechanism for transfers of Personal Data from the EU to the U.S., Braze continues to comply with and self-certify to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States.
Braze has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Braze is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
==========
In connection with onward transfers, Braze has responsibility for the processing of Personal Data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to any third party who is acting as an agent on Braze’s behalf.
Braze will remain responsible under the Privacy Shield Principles if any such agent processes such Personal Data in a manner that is inconsistent with those Principles, unless Braze can provide evidence that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Braze commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data.
EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Braze at:
privacy@braze.com
Braze Privacy Policy Issues
330 West 34th Street, 18th Floor
New York, NY 10001
USA
Braze has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints regarding Personal Data transferred from the EU, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
Under certain circumstances, individuals may be able to invoke binding arbitration, in accordance with the Privacy Shield requirements.
In addition, as a U.S.-based company, Braze may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
3.2 SECURITY
We use technical, organizational and administrative security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of information.
==========
3.3 DATA RETENTION
We will retain Personal Data we collect from you for so long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out in Part II above).
We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the purpose for which we process the Personal Data, the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
PART IV.
==========

If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your Personal Data, you can do so at any time by contacting us through this FORM (which will ask from you information necessary for us to process your request) or by using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
We provide additional information below for California residents who wish to submit access or deletion requests.

==========
You can manage your cookie preferences by visiting our Cookie Consent Manager.
If we have collected and processed your Personal Data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

PART V. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR EEA AND UK VISITORS
If you are a visitor to our Websites from the EEA or the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us through this FORM (which will ask from you information necessary for us to process your request) or by using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
