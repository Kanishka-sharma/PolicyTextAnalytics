Evite ("Evite") Statement on Privacy and Security of Information ("Policy").
The following Policy explains our information collection, use and disclosure practices.
This Policy applies to all the information collected from you during use of our Web site, http://www.evite.com (the "Site").
By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.
==========
Information Collected 1.
Personally Identifiable Information Collected by Evite:   When you register with the Evite service, our registration form may require you to give us certain information such as your name, email address, and zip code.
Evite will also collect other information you volunteer to us through use of our service that may be used to identify you, such as your cell phone number.
We refer to this information as "Personally Identifiable Information."
You always may choose not to provide such Personally Identifiable Information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content.
We may also collect demographic and other data, which may include Personally Identifiable Information, generally through surveys and forms in which you may or may not choose to participate.
If you place an order for goods on Evite, you may be required to enter your credit card number and information, as well as your shipping address and/or other contact information.
==========
From time to time, Evite may also have special offers or promotions that are sponsored by a Business Partner.
In order to participate in these offers, you may be required to follow a separate registration process.
Evite may also offer goods or services for purchase available by our Business Partners.
If you purchase goods or services offered through Evite by a Business Partner, then you may be required to submit Personally Identifiable Information in order to complete the transaction and Evite may provide Personally Identifiable Information about you to such Business Partner for that purpose.
If you elect to receive information from a Business Partner, or if you provide information to obtain a product or service,  Evite may pass your information to such Business Partner.

==========
My Info Page:   If you choose to build a My Info Page you will be required to supply a user name, password, valid email address, your country and your zip code.
You will also be asked a series of questions, many, but not all of which are optional, regarding your interests that will allow other users to search for people like you who share common interests.
If you choose, you may allow your responses to these questions to be viewable only by other users and/or guests who are invited to the same events as you.
==========
Evite may capture searches conducted by you on the Evite service, including other My Info Pages viewed by you, in order to make suggestions to you regarding what activities or topics might be of interest to you, and in order to build your "network" of contacts.
You may also contact other people through their My Info Page, and Evite will hide your email address, by directing your message to that person's inbox in their Message Center.

==========
Personally Identifiable Information Collected by Evite's Business Partners:  Evite works with third-party advertising companies, sponsors and other companies with whom we do business ("Business Partners") to place advertising on our Site and in email communications sent to our registered users and to recipients of invitations, Reminders, and other communications related to the Evite service or to offer products and services on our Site.
Our Business Partners may read or set cookies on your hard drive, use pixel tags, track which ads you have viewed, or collect other information about you.
Cookies and pixel tags are discussed further below.
==========
In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with a Business Partner in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages that appear the same as or very similar to the pages of the Evite service.
These pages are known as "Co-Branded Pages" and these particular Business Partners are known as "Co-Branded Business Partners."
If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then Personally Identifiable Information about you may be collected by both Evite and the Co-Branded Business Partner.
Personally Identifiable Information collected directly by a Business Partner will be governed by the Business Partner’s privacy policy, not this Site’s Policy.

Guest Contact Information:   In order to send messages to guests through the Evite service, we require that you submit to Evite a current, valid email addresses for guests.
When you send messages to guests through our service (e.g., an Evite invitation or a Reminder), we collect and retain the email addresses or other pertinent contact information of those persons to whom you send the message.
If you receive such an invitation as a guest and choose to use the Site, we may request additional information and the treatment of information collected from you as a guest will be governed by this Policy.
For example, if you or your guests choose to use certain services offered through our Site, such as the carpool service, you or your guest may be asked to submit to Evite an email address, phone number and/or other contact information so that we may provide you with such service.

Cookies and similar technologies:   Evite wants to optimize your experience by ensuring that the most relevant information, promotions and offers are displayed to you while using the Site.
A common manner in which to do this is by using cookies or similar technologies to gather information.
Cookies are strings of text and numbers that our server places on your hard drive that can identify your computer to us when you visit our Site, and which may be correlated with Personally Identifiable Information about you in our log files.
In the event a location, like a zip code, is not available in your profile or you have not searched in a location on Evite, we will cookie your location from your last Evite invitation.

==========
IP Address:   When you visit our Site, we log standard information such as your IP address, which is a number that can be used to identify your location and Internet Service Provider, along with the URL from which you came to our Site and the URLs visited on our Site.
A URL is the full address of a Web site page, which may or may not contain some Personally Identifiable Information about the person who is viewing it.

==========
Pixel Tags:   Evite uses pixel tags to gather information about the emails we send to our registered users and to recipients of messages.
Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages.
When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with your email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the invite or reminder, that the recipient's email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email, and other standard logging information.
The pixel tag also may see or read cookies.
For more information about cookies and how to disable their use, see the section below on "Use of Cookies."

However, to ensure your privacy, Evite will not display or give out your email address or any other contact information to other users except as otherwise described in this Policy.
We have developed a Message Center that uses a "double-blind" email system, which hides the email addresses of both the sender and recipient of email messages to protect the privacy of both the sender and receiver.
When using the Message Center, it is up to you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your email address, or any other contact information, to others through private communications.
