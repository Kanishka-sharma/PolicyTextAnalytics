We also use the information for in-house research to:
improve our understanding of customer needs in developing Economist.com
build marketing profiles
aid strategic development
manage our relationship with advertisers
The results of all such research and analysis will be presented as anonymous or aggregated information and will not reveal any personal facts about individual customers.

Cookies
A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive during an Economist.com visit.
This file allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site.
It is used to identify returning users and to identify subscribers and registrants (a registrant - and subscriber - will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them).
This means that if you are a registrant or subscriber, you will not have to login each time you visit.
We also use a cookie to track a user's sessions.
==========
We use this information to find out what site features are most popular so that we can develop Economist.com in the light of our analysis of people’s usage.
We also use cookies and the information we collect to show you relevant content and advertising.
You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time.
Bear in mind, though, that if you delete these cookies, any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be reset when you log in again.
Unlike many sites, you will be able to use Economist.com even if you set your browser not to accept any cookies.
However, certain features and content may not be available to you and you will have to log in every time you visit.

E-mails
Economist.com uses reputable third parties to deliver the e-mails you will receive from our site if you subscribe to our e-mail newsletters or have chosen to receive information about Economist.com products and offers.
These third parties use unique identifiers and invisible images (often called "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") to perform message open sensing, message format sensing, and clickthrough sensing on behalf of Economist.com in order to bring you more relevant information.
==========
To find out more about these technologies as used in the e-mails sent on behalf of Economst.com by DoubleClick Inc., please click here.
Content and some ad services in these e-mails are provided by Economist.com or another third party ad server.
==========
Adverts
Our advert-serving software may place or use a cookie on your computer in order to make sure that you do not receive the same advert many times in the same session.
Some of the advertisers on Economist.com do not use our in-house advert-serving software and their adverts are served by third-parties who may place cookies.
==========
Security Policy
Economist.com has appropriate measures in place to ensure that users' personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered within the Economist Group server environment.
Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside the Economist Group to other data processors (i.e. fulfillment bureaus, database consultants etc.) but they will only act upon instruction from the Economist Group in order to perform the services required.
==========
Transfer of Personal Data Overseas
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.
Therefore, by browsing Economist.com and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.
Updating Customer Details
It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of products.
==========
Global Executive Self-Assessment Questionnaires
If you complete a Global Executive Self-Assessment questionnaire, we will collect personal details about you and the answers you submit.
This is to enable us to provide scores and personalised reports and to enable you to re-start the questionnaire within 24 hours of first taking the test.
After 24 hours, your answers will be anonymised and they may then be used for research and analysis purposes, particularly to help us and our suppliers improve the quality of the questionnaires.
Should you want to anonymise your data sooner, a link is provided throughout the Self-Assessment pages for this purpose.
==========
Children Under 13
The Economist Group does not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13.
When necessary, underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent or guardian has informed us that these details have been collected.
Changes to this statement
Due to changes in legislation and best practice or enhancements to functionality and content on Economist.com we may make changes to our privacy policy and will reflect those changes in this statement, so you should check here from time to time.
