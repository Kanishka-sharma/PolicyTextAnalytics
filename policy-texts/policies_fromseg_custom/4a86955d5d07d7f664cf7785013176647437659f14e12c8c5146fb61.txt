End User License Agreement
Giving Assistant's mission is to transform everyday shopping into charitable giving.
Our charitable loyalty platform - inclusive of a shopping rewards platform and charitable loyalty software - makes it easy to support over 1.5 million registered charities in the U.S. simply when shopping online.
==========
Our terms and conditions reflect our company values and have been carefully established to ensure the continued growth, enjoyment, and advantage of our platform for the community we proudly serve.
Please do not hesitate to notify Giving Assistant of any members or organizations benefiting from our platform who are, or may be, in violation of these terms.
About Giving Assistant: Shopping Rewards Platform.
Our consumer-facing shopping rewards platform allows shoppers to earn cash back and support their charity favorite cause when shopping at over 3,000 of the most popular brands including Macy's, Target, and Walmart.
==========
Only your email address and password are required to sign up and start saving.
Giving Assistant does not require you to install software on your computer, and we do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
==========
Members can earn cash back on purchases simply by using the website GivingAssistant.org.
Brands pay a commission to Giving Assistant for being sent paying customers, which we return to our shoppers in the form of cash back.
Typically the commission is a percentage of the sale, and varies by retailer.
Instead of keeping some or all of that money, like most sites, we give 100% of it back to our Power Shoppers, and 50% of it back to our Savvy Shoppers.
==========
Shoppers are able to automatically donate any percentage of their cash back to any Eligible Nonprofit of their choice.
(See “Eligible Nonprofit” criteria in the Nonprofit Terms and Conditions section below.)
==========
Cash Back Payments.
We offer our shoppers four convenient payment methods:
PayPal
eCheck
All methods are free and require a minimum cash back accrual of $5.99 USD before payout.
You can change your preferred payment method by going to your account page and clicking on “Cash Back” in the left side navigation.
To receive payment of accrued cash back and any other rewards, you must create and maintain an account with Giving Assistant using accurate and up-to-date information including: a valid email address at which you are able to receive email; your first and last name; and a password to protect your account.
==========
If Giving Assistant suspects fraudulent activity is associated with your account, we reserve the right to delay or withhold payment indefinitely.
Giving Assistant is not responsible for payments delivered to the wrong address through no fault of Giving Assistant or for errors made by payment partners like PayPal.
==========
If eChecks are returned or expired, Giving Assistant will reissue payment if requested.
After one year, if you have not claimed or deposited your cash back payment, Giving Assistant reserves the right to reabsorb these earnings.
For information on payment schedules and other cash back topics, please see our FAQs.

Nonprofit Donations.
For donations generated from our shopping rewards platform, Giving Assistant sends eChecks to Eligible Nonprofits within 7 days of the nonprofit verifying their payment email address in their Giving Assistant dashboard, typically on a Monday.
(After that, donation eChecks are sent quarterly, during the months of February, May, August, and November.)
The donation will be returned to the shopper if you, the Eligible Nonprofit to which the donation was allocated, do not accept the funds within 12 months of the shopper's original transaction date.
For donations generated through our charitable loyalty software on our partner websites, Giving Assistant engages with a Donor Advised Fund to facilitate quarterly distributions - February, May, August, and November - which are tax deductible by the Partner.
In the event a nonprofit is not eligible or the funds can not reach their intended nonprofit, the funds will be re-granted to an Eligible Nonprofit of the Partner’s choosing.
