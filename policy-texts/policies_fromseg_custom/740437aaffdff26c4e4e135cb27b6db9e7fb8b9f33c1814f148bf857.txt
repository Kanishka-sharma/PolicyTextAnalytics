About Cookies
Cookies are small files – usually made of letters and numbers – downloaded on to a device (computer, tablet, phone, or similar device) when you visit a website.
Cookies allow a website to recognize a user’s device and are used by website owners to operate their websites more efficiently.
Cookies are used to understand how the site or service is being used, to help you navigate between pages efficiently, to help remember your preferences, and generally to improve your browsing experience.
Cookies may also be used to ensure marketing information you see online is more relevant to you and your interests and to deliver advertisements and communications relevant to your interests, provided you have subscribed to these advertisements and communications.
==========

(i)     Strictly necessary Cookies.
These Cookies are essential for the operation of ST Sites (for example, to enable you to log into secure areas of our website or use a shopping cart).
These Cookies enable you to access the ST Sites and use their features.
Disabling these Cookies will encumber the ST Sites’ performance and may make the features and service unavailable.
(ii)     Analytics Cookies.
These Cookies collect information about how you use the ST Sites for the purposes of improving and optimizing the way ST Sites work and to ensure that visitors can easily find the information they are looking for on ST Sites.

These Cookies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device’s browsing activity on other sites or services other than ST Sites.
This information may be shared with organizations outside ST, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
==========
Session and Persistent Cookies
