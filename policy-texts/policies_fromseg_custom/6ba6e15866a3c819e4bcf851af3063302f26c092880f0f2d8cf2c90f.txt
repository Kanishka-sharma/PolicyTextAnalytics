We built Gravity to make it easy for you to share your thoughts and ideas with the world.
==========
Gravity gives you a voice on the web by making it easy for you to express yourself and your opinions by participating in conversations that you care about.
We invite you to share your thoughts and ideas and urge you to always be respectful of others when expressing your point of view.
==========
Gravity's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Project Rover, Inc. (we or us) collects and uses the personal and other information you decide to share, and to help you make informed decisions when using the current and future products and services offered by us through gravity.com and any of our Partner Sites (Gravity or the Service).
Our business is based upon the collection of user contributed content, user information, and user activity information via the Service in order to allow us and our partners to deliver customized content, relevant metrics, and advertising.
==========
As we add new Services, we will notify users of supplementary privacy notices applicable to such services.
We process all of your information under this Privacy Policy.
The controller of each Gravity Site (as defined in Section 1) may also process such information in accordance with their own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read.
Where a Partner Site (as defined in Section 1) uses our Services, we require them to accurately describe the practices and purposes of their information collection, use, and sharing.
Opting Out.
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish us to use or share your information as described in this policy, you may adjust your account settings to prevent some such use or sharing and you always have the right to cancel your account with us.
Information Collection & Use
When you visit and interact with gravity.com or a third-party website that offers our Services and includes a link to this privacy policy (each, a Partner Site) (gravity.com and Partner Sites, each a Gravity Site), you provide us with three types of information: Content (as defined in the Gravity Terms of Service); personal information including your IP address and other personal information that you purposely disclose or that you authorize to be disclosed on your behalf (Personal Information); and Measured Data (as defined in this Section 1).
==========
User Contributed Content.
We will receive any Content you contribute to a Gravity Site, including but not limited to text, messages, posts, html, URLs, images, video and other rich media content, that you knowingly submit.

We collect and retain this Content so that we can provide you the Service and offer personalized features.

In order to access certain functionality of the Service, you will be required to become a registered user.
When you register with us at a Gravity Site, we collect your name, email address, user name, location, IP address, age, and gender, as well as any other personal or preference information that you choose to provide.
If you submit your credentials (e.g., username and password) for a third-party website (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) during your registration for the Gravity Service, Gravity will receive such information, as well as any other information that is made available by such third-party website.
We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Gravity that we think you may find valuable.
We may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Service.
==========
For instance, if a user invites you to a conversation or sends you a new message, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact.
Generally, you may opt out of such emails from the Notifications page on gravity.com, though we reserve the right to send you important notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.

Providing additional profile information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to be discovered and understood by other users in the Gravity universe.

We present this information back to you when you access the Service and to other users of Gravity.

==========

If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to a conversation or to tell a friend about Gravity, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address.
We will use such information to send your friend(s) an email and reminder e-mails in your name inviting him or her to visit gravity.com, to allow you to see invitations you have sent, and to track the success of our referral program.
