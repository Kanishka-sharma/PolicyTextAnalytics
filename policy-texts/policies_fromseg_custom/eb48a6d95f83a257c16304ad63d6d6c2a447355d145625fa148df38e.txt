==========
The application of the United Nations Convention
    on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Any

For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under
    this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000,

    non-appearance-based arbitration.

    ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties.
The ADR
    provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the
    arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on
