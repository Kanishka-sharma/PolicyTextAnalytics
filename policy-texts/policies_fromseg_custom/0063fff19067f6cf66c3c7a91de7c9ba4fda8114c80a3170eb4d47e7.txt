Tencent is committed to protecting your privacy.
Sometimes we need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data collection and use in those situations.
This privacy statement only applies to Tencent.com and QQ.com.
Please read the complete Tencent.com privacy statement.
==========
Collection of Your Personal Information
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you.
Generally, this information is requested when you are registering QQ or other on-line services.
Personal Information collected by Tencent often is limited to your name, sex, age, birthday, ID number, address, educational level, information of your employer company, profession and your hobbies etc.
Control of Your Personal Information
Tencent may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or provided by the Terms of Service and Software License Agreement, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Tencent or the site; (b) conform to the Terms of Service or the Software License Agreement; (c) protect and defend the rights or property of Tencent and its family of Web sites, or (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Tencent employees, users of Tencent products or services, or members of the public.
Tencent will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions listed hereof.
Security of your information
Tencent is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
If you have any problem with the security of your information, please call us at Law@tencent.com.
==========
Use of Cookies
Tencent uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
For example, if you personalize Tencent's pages, or register with Tencent sites or services, a cookie helps Tencent to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
==========
This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, preferred email address, and so on.
When you return to Tencent, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Tencent features that you customized.
Please note that Tencent allows other companies that are presenting advertisements or researching users' response to advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer.
Advertisers' and researchers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not Tencent's privacy statement.
==========
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Tencent services or Web sites you visit.
Use of Web Beacons
Web pages may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
==========
Tencent uses web beacons in the following ways:
Within the Tencent Network
Tencent uses web beacons within the Tencent network of web sites in order to count users and to recognize users by accessing Tencent cookies.
Being able to access Tencent cookies allows us to personalize your experience when you visit Tencent web sites.
Outside the Tencent Network
Information recorded through these web beacons is used to report aggregate information about Tencent users to our partners.
This aggregate information may include demographic and usage information.
No personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners from this research.
==========
Use of Third Party Ad Networks
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on Tencent Web pages are displayed by Tencent.
In addition, Tencent allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Tencent Web pages.
Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer.
Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.
In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.
This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
Tencent does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.
==========
Access to Your Personal Information
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your Personal Information is correct and current.
If you register on Tencent.com or QQ.com, you can review and edit your Personal Information any time.
You can view and edit Personal Information you have already given us at Tencent.com or QQ.com as the case may be, or you can delete your Personal Information at Tencent.com or QQ.com as the case may be any time.
==========
Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information
Tencent is especially concerned about the safety and protection of children's Personal Information collected and used online.
Tencent suggests that children under 16 years of age get prior written approval from their parents or guardian (hereafter the "Guardian").
Tencent will not use children's Personal Information, nor will it disclose to any third party the recognizable information of the children without prior approval of the Guardian, unless it is necessary for us to provide our service to the children.
Having obtained consent from the Guardian, Tencent.com may collect the information of the children.
However, the Guardian shall have the right to change or revoke the consent it has previously made for Tencent services and to review or request the deletion of his/her children's Personal Information.
Tencent will not condition the child's participation in an activity on the provision of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
==========
Exemption of Liability
Tencent shall not be liable for (i) disclosing your Personal Information as required by law or relevant governmental authority; or (ii) leaking of your Personal Information, which results from your own negligent acts, such as disclosing your password to other people or sharing the same account with other people, or leaking of your Personal Information which does not result from Tencent's acts; or (iii) any dispute resulting from the use of Personal Information by any third-party, which has already been listed in this statement; (iv) any consequence resulting from hackers, computer viruses or temporary closure of our websites imposed by relevant governmental authorities; or (v) any consequence resulting from Acts of God.
In addition, exemption of liability stipulated in the Terms of Service provided by Tencent and its family of Web sites shall also apply here.
Tencent will occasionally update this privacy statement.
When we do so, we will also revise the "last modified" date of the privacy statement.
