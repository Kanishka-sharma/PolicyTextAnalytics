TERMS RELATING TO SUBSCRIPTION AND PURCHASES 1.
Terms relating to Subscription offerings.
1.
==========
Our Subscription offerings are available at different prices, as presented on our website, and updated from time to time.
We reserve the right to change those prices at any time.
In any event, whatever the price, it will always be clearly marked on the subscription page for the channel/package/downloadable content and clearly marked when you enter your credit card information.
2.
==========
A valid credit card or active PayPal account are required to pay for the order fees.
The fees will be charged only when you submit the credit card information to us or when PayPal has authorized the transfer of funds.
3.
==========
Once you subscribe to a particular channel/package, you're not limited to watching it on one device (PC, laptop, etc), but you are limited to watching it on one device at a time.
We do, however, reserve the right to change that policy at any time and from time-to-time.
2.
Terms relating to our Subscription Service.
1.
==========
In order to subscribe to our subscription service you will need to enter your credit card information or a valid PayPal account.
The subscriptions are set to automatic recurring charges so that service is not interrupted.
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION WITH EACH RENEWED BILLING CYCLE UNTIL YOU REQUEST TO STOP THE SUBSCRIPTION (or until we decide to stop, whichever comes first).
2.
==========
If you decide at some point that you want to cancel your subscription, you must request to cancel by contacting our Customer Support, contact details are listed on the site.
Subscribers to monthly plans may tell us to do so by giving 5 days’ notice.
Subscribers to multiple-month (i.e. Yearly) plans must give 14 days’ notice when requesting account cancellation.
3.
==========
Please note that once you cancel your monthly subscription, it will not actually expire until your next billing cycle.
Telewebion will not provide you with a refund for the current cycle.
What this means is, once we have charged you for a billing cycle this cycle cannot be cancelled and you will have access to the subscription for the full duration of this cycle.
This also applies in cases where you were charged within 5 days of giving notice of the cancellation.
Of course, once you cancel, you can re-subscribe at any time.
==========
When a multiple-month (i.e. Yearly) subscription is cancelled, the subscription will be broken down into monthly increments, according to the date of subscription, and closed at the end of the month in which the subscription was canceled.
For example, if a 1-year subscription was purchased on the 5th of January & is cancelled on the 20th of February, it will be closed at the end of that subscription month which is the 5th of March.
4.
==========
Once you subscribe to our channel(s)/package, we will bill your credit card or Pay Pal account on the same date at the beginning of each new billing cycle (the "Payment Date").
For example, if you subscribe for a monthly subscription on May 15, we will bill your credit card on May 15 and again on June 15 and again on July 15 and so on.
If the date on which you subscribed does not exist in certain future months/years, for instance, if you subscribe on January 31, what happens in February and April?
==========
We will bill your credit card on the closest available day.
So, in the above example, we would bill your credit card not on February 31 but on February 28 and, not on April 31 but on April 30.
Should you elect to cancel your subscription and then re-subscribe at a later date, that later date will be your new Payment Date.
3.
==========
Terms Relating to Refunds 1.
