DESCRIPTION OF CUEBIQ’S SERVICES

Cuebiq offers a location intelligence platform that provides marketers location-based, AI-driven analytics and measurement to map and measure the consumer journey, helping marketers answer strategic questions and make the right decisions in order to influence consumers through the sales funnel.
We collect and process device identified data from users who consent to location data sharing via our partners apps for purposes related to advertising, attribution, analytics, research, and cross-device identity.
Cuebiq receives this location information either from an “SDK” (software development kit) that it provides to mobile application partners (“apps”) or from a server-to-server transfer and integration with mobile app partners.
This location information includes data points such as lat/long (latitudinal and longitudinal) data, i.e., GPS-level data, and/or WiFi data (if feasible) associated with a mobile advertising ID, such as an IDFA on iOS platforms or a Google Play Advertising ID on Android platforms.
Advertising:  We use the information we collect to make inferences about what types of activities users tend to spend time doing.
==========
For instance, we may notice a particular Device frequently at locations associated with sports (e.g., an arena), music (e.g., a concert venue), eating out (e.g., restaurants) or health and fitness (e.g., a gym or health club).
We use this information to categorize Device users into “interest segments” – which advertisers can use to tailor advertising to those users who appear on mobile ad platforms they work with.
To see examples of those segments, please click here.
==========
Attribution:  We also use some of the information we collect (including location information, IP Address or mobile advertising IDs) to help advertisers analyze aggregate ad performance – such as by measuring whether or how Devices that saw a particular ad, whether it be in the physical world, in the digital world, or on TV, tended to engage with a particular product.
In addition, we sometimes use any or all of the above information to help advertisers better understand their customers or their marketing, such as for market research, customer analytics, or analytics of traffic patterns.
==========
We sometimes collect the above data through “pixels” (described above) (“Pixel Data”), and we use such data to perform aggregated “attribution” analysis.
This analysis can help marketers and their service providers understand which users have been exposed to which ad campaigns.
This data may be measured or matched against aggregate location data in order to provide a “match rate” for an attribution study as to devices that have been detected at a given location – to provide similar services and analysis for marketers as those described above.
For instance, if numerous devices that were sent an ad or offer for “Cuebiq Coffee” on Tuesday then went to a Cuebiq Coffee on Wednesday or Thursday, an advertiser might conclude that the ad campaign was successful.
Analytics:  We help marketers better understand the offline consumer journey with location analytics that provide use cases, such as: offline competitive intelligence, market-share, consumer preferences, path-to-purchase and footfall analysis.
==========
This helps them identify areas of growth and activate those insights to drive performance.
This may include sharing more detailed device and location information to allow marketers to bridge their own analytics with Cuebiq’s to develop combined aggregate insights.
==========
Cuebiq may receive non-app user data through public data sources or data partners who aggregate public, user consented psychographic and demographic data, television content and ad viewing data, or other forms of transactional data such as purchase information.
This information is used only to provide enriched views into aggregated analytics, is not used for advertising purposes, and is not shared with other partners.
Research:  We work with research partners to allow them to derive inferences about traffic patterns supports causes such as improving the quality of life in underserved communities, natural disaster response, and smart city development through our Data for Good initiative.
==========
Cross-Device Identity:  Cuebiq may use the various identifiers that it has collected from your device, such as Mobile Ad ID (MAID), Device ID or ID for Vendor (IDFV), other Device IDs, IP Address, hashed forms of persistent identifiers such as an email address (for example, an email address has gone through a one-way transformation process that does not reveal the actual email address to Cuebiq but could be used to link to experiences together where the same email address was provided to different parties), and information about your device (such as model, operating system type and version, carrier) in combination with the location information you have provided to Cuebiq with consent to help recognize you and your device across the internet.
Cuebiq may also share this information with partners, and receive similar information, to collectively allow each party to better recognize you and your device across the internet.
This form of identification may sometimes be based on probability and not certainty that one ID is related to another ID.
You may opt-out of cross-device identity at any time – please see your options in the Privacy Controls section.
==========
We refer to all of the above services as the “Services.”
