Arbitration Procedures.
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Seattle (WA), or any other location we agree to.
==========
Arbitration Fees and Incentives.

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.
Either you or Screencast-O-Matic may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Seattle (WA) or any United States county where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in King County, Washington to resolve your claim.
==========
NO CLASS ACTIONS.

These TOS create no third party beneficiary rights.
Waiver, Severability & Assignment
Screencast-O-Matic's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.

You may not assign any of your rights under these TOS, and any such attempt will be void.
Screencast-O-Matic may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

Referral Program Description
From time to time, Screencast-O-Matic may offer a referral program ("Referral Program") to its users ("Referring Users") permitting such Referring User to earn a Pro Recorder new or renewal subscription discount by inviting or referring another person who is not a then-current or past user of Screencast-O-Matic (a "Referred User"), to sign up for an annual Pro Recorder subscription to Screencast-O-Matic using the Referring User's Referral Link (defined herein).
Referred Users are eligible for a one-time 20% discount on their first annual Pro Recorder subscription fee when they use a Referring User's Referral Link to sign up for an account, as further described in these Referral Terms.
Acceptance of these Referral Terms; Revised Referral Terms
By participating in the Referral Program in any way, you agree to be bound by these Referral Terms.
If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of these Referral Terms, you may not participate in the Referral Program.
We reserve the right to change any of the terms and conditions contained in these Referral Terms at any time and in our sole discretion by posting the revised Referral Terms via the Screencast-O-Matic services in accordance with our Terms of Service.
If you do not agree to these Referral Terms or any revised version of these Referral Terms, your sole recourse is to terminate your participation in the Referral Program.
Except as otherwise expressly stated by us, your participation in the Referral Program is subject to, and constitutes your acceptance of, the version of these Referral Terms in effect at the time of your participation in the Referral Program.
While Referral Links (defined below) do not expire, any changes to these Referral Terms will apply to use of a Referral Link by a Referred User even if the Referral Link was sent prior to the revised Referral Terms effectiveness.

Earning Pro Recorder Subscription Discounts
When you register for a Screencast-O-Matic account, or from time to time thereafter, we may provide you with a hyperlink, text link, badge, button, or other code via email, text message or other format containing a URL link unique to your Screencast-O-Matic account (a "Referral Link"), which you may share with your contacts, either by email or social network as prompted by the Screencast-O-Matic services, or by other means outside of the Screencast-O-Matic services.
Subject to these Referral Terms, upon a Referred User completing a Qualifying Sign Up (defined herein), we will send you an email announcing your discount reward and update your awards status on your account page at screencast-o-matic.
com.
It is your responsibility to provide Screencast-O-Matic with a current email address through the Screencast-O-Matic Services to ensure timely email notification of any rewards, though your account page will be updated immediately.
==========
A "Qualifying Sign Up" means the first time a Referred User signs up for the Screencast-O-Matic services and subscribes to an annual paid Pro Recorder subscription.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Referring Users will not be eligible to receive a discount if we determine in our sole discretion that (i) the Referred User has previously signed up for an annual Pro Recorder subscription; (ii) if the Referred User cancels its annual subscription within 1 year of the Qualifying Sign Up.
You can keep earning discounts for each Qualified Sign Up, including earning a free annual Pro Recorder Subscription.
If you earn more than 5 discounts, your additional discounts will be applied to your Pro Recorder Subscription renewal on the anniversary of your Subscription plan.
You can keep earning discounts up to a lifetime subscription to the Pro Recorder.
Referred User Discount
Subject to these Referral Terms, a Referred User will receive a 20% discount (the "Discount") toward an annual Pro Recorder subscription.
Referred Users will be required to register and to accept our Terms of Service in order to use the Screencast-O-Matic services and to take advantage of the Discount.
The Discount shall only apply toward a Referred User's first annual Pro Recorder subscription fee, and without limiting the foregoing, will not apply to (I) subsequent renewal subscription fees; (ii) any subscription plan other than the Pro Recorder annual plan, or (iii) any other fees or charges which may apply to a Referred User's use of the Screencast-O-Matic services.

Restrictions and Limitations
We reserve the right to investigate any suspicious or inappropriate activity relating to the Referral Program.
You may not engage in any fraudulent or deceitful behavior in connection with the Referral Program, including, without limitation, if you, directly or indirectly, offer any person a financial or other incentive to use your Referral Link or attempt to redirect traffic from, or divert Referral Rewards from, any other participant in the Referral Program.
You may not use "bots," "spambots," "scrapers," or any program or means designed to automatically send your Referral Link to third parties, or attempt to use your own Referral Link by registering for an additional account with Screencast-O-Matic.
==========
Referring Users and Referred Users will not be eligible to receive a Discount if such user violates these Referral Terms or the Terms of Service.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to delay honoring of a Discount while we investigate your participation in the Referral Program or any use of a Referral Link.
Non-Exclusive
The Referral Program is non-exclusive.
You acknowledge and agree that we may, at any time, solicit customer referrals via any method in our sole discretion.
Termination or Suspension of Referral Program
You may stop participating in the Referral Program at any time.
We may, in our sole discretion, suspend, limit, or terminate the Referral Program and terminate these Referral Terms and Conditions for any reason at any time, with or without providing notice to you.
Termination of the Referral Program and these Referral Terms will not automatically result in the termination of our Terms of Service or your Screencast-O-Matic account, unless otherwise specified by us.
However, termination of our Terms of Service or your Screencast-O-Matic account will result in the automatic termination of your participation in the Referral Program and termination of these Referral Terms.
Upon termination of these Referral Terms, you must immediately cease all use of Referral Links, and any Discounts earned but not used as of the date of termination will remain available, unless we terminate these Referral Terms for your breach of these Referral Terms or our Terms of Service.
Provisions of these Referral Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Referral Terms will survive termination of these Referral Terms.
Privacy
When a Referring User shares their Referral link with a third party through the Screencast-O-Matic services, we may collect certain information about such third party as provided by the Referring User.
Please see our Privacy Policy at http://screencast-o-matic.com/privacy for information about how we collect, use, and disclose such information.
