        The front door to your home.
Open, it invites and welcomes friends and family.
Closed, it provides important privacy and security.

Information is a "door" which we should just as thoughtfully consider before

Getting 
        to Know You
        When you make a purchase in one of our Crate and Barrel or CB2 stores, join our gift registry, 
        or answer one of our surveys, you may choose to give us 
        basic information: name, email address, mailing address, ZIP code, 
        phone, and credit card numbers.
This allows us to process your transactions 
        more efficiently, and ultimately, to give you a higher caliber of customer 
        service.
When you visit our Web site, we may collect more information: 
        your Internet service provider's address, the name of the Web page directing 
        you, as well as your clicks and activity on our site.
This tracking data 
        helps us understand how to make our site more available and user friendly to our customers.
Getting 
        To Know What You Like
        We also gather customer information by taking note of the purchases you make online, 
        in our stores, and from our catalogues.
Think of it as a concierge service where 
        customer preferences are remembered for future consideration.
==========
By looking at your 
        purchases in context with marketing demographics or with information from companies 
        whose products and services you may be interested in, it helps our buyers and 
        merchandisers continue to seek out products and designs you may find relevant and unique.
Likewise, other companies may also forward to us additional names, mailing addresses, 
        and email addresses when we have news or product offerings that may be of special interest 
        to their customers.
In order to serve you better, we may at times contract with other companies to help us 
		process information.
For instance, their assistance can help us better fulfill customer orders, 
		manage and enhance customer data, and comply with postal regulations.
For your security, 
		these companies are bound by our non-disclosure agreements or contractual arrangements to 
		provide privacy protection for your information.
Information 
        At Your Service
       The personal information we collect is primarily intended to offer better customer service 
       and to improve communications.
==========
When a purchased item is not immediately available, many of 
       our customers appreciate receiving an email to update the status of their order.
We also 
       may need to contact customers by phone, postal mail, or email if questions arise regarding their orders.
When you shop at a Crate and Barrel or CB2 store, order from our catalogues, or visit us online, 
		it is also an opportunity for you to provide us with information and feedback that helps us 
		continue to bring new ideas, unique products, and a creative approach to shopping for your home.
==========
Information Secure Under Lock And Key
	    We take all reasonable steps to protect our customers' personal information against loss, 
	    misuse, and alteration.
We use encryption technology whenever receiving and transferring your 
	    personal information on our site.
When you make a purchase online, either a solid key or a locked padlock icon will appear in 
		the lower right of your browser window.
This icon indicates that your transaction session is 
		secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
If one of these icons does not appear, please 
		contact Crate and Barrel at 800-967-6696 to complete your purchase.
==========
Update Your Information  
        Updating your contact information is quick and easy.
Just contact 
        us, including your previous and current full name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.
Please understand updates may take from six to eight weeks to process from the date of request receipt.
Information Sharing
        Information sharing can provide a valuable type of consumer networking.
==========
By helping to make new connections 
        and introduce new resources to our customers, you may discover new opportunities and products compatible 
        with your interests and needs.
With that end in mind, when you purchase an item from one of our catalogues, 
        your customer information is shared with other select companies whose products and services you may find useful.
Information Sharing Is Up To You
        We appreciate and respect that not all customers may wish to benefit from 
        the opportunity to share information with other select companies.
If you 
        do not want Crate and Barrel and CB2 to share your customer information, please immediately 
        contact us 
        and we will remove your name from lists we share with other companies.
==========
After 
        the six to eight week time period it takes to process your request, 
        your information will no longer be shared.
When contacting us, please clearly 
        state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.
It is important to understand that with some companies or online partners, for example 
		WeddingChannel.com, your information must be shared in order to receive their services.
By agreeing to share information, our customers may have the opportunity to participate 
		in a wider array of services and offerings.

         and identifiable information from our records in compliance with the Online
