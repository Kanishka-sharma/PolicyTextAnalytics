What information do we collect at target.com?
How do we use it?
Your personal information.
At target.com, we only collect 
              personally identifiable information about you to the extent you 
              specifically provide it to us.
==========
This includes, for example, the information 
              you provide when you place an order, register for a club or service, 
              respond to a survey or apply for a credit card online.
We use this 
              information you share with us 
            
to provide the products, services or membership benefits you 
                request, 
 to improve the content of our site and enhance your shopping 
                experience, and 
 for marketing and promotional purposes.
We may share this information with other members of the Target 
              Corporation family of businesses.
They may use this information 
              as we would, and you may occasionally receive product and service 
              information from them.
In addition, we may share this information 
              with third parties that we believe are reputable in order to offer 
              products and services that may be of interest to you.
Finally, we 
              may share this information with outside vendors and organizations 
              that provide support services to us or that help us with our marketing 
              programs.
Other information about you.
==========
In addition to personal information 
              you provide us, target.com uses technology that lets us know what 
              type of browser you are using, the Web site from which you enter 
              target.com, and the pages you view as you tour our site.
This technology 
              does not identify you personally - it simply helps us compile statistics 
              about our guests and their use of our site.
We use these statistics 
              and share them with third parties to improve our Web site design 
              and content and in connection with marketing programs.
==========
What if you do not wish to receive promotional information as 
              a result of using the target.com Web site?
We intend to offer our guests only opportunities that will interest 
              them, and we believe they will welcome the information they receive 
              as a result of visiting target.com.
However, we respect some guests' 
              preference to limit their e-mail, mail and telephone calls.
If you 
              would prefer not to receive promotional information as a result 
              of using the target.com Website, we will do our best to remove 
              your name from our marketing programs .
We will act promptly 
              to honor your request.
However, even if we remove your name from 
              use in our marketing programs, you may still receive catalogs and 
              other promotional materials from the Target Corporation family of 
              businesses and their partners if they obtained your name before 
              it was removed or from a source other than target.com.
==========
Children
target.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information 
              from children under the age of 13.
If a child has provided target.com 
              with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or 
              guardian click here and we will 
              do our best to delete the information from our files.
Your consent
By using the target.com Website, you consent to our use of guest 
              information as described in this Online Privacy Policy.
As we implement 
              new technology and introduce new services, we will update our Online 
              Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to review it often.

Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)
target.com uses Secure Socket Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal 
              credit information, including your credit card number, before it 
              travels over the Internet.
SSL technology is the industry standard 
              for secure online transactions.
Because we use SSL, placing an order 
              online at target.com is just as safe as giving your credit card 
              number over the phone.
The law protects you, too
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing 
              and using your credit card number.
In addition, consumer protection 
              laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card.
Under federal law, if someone steals your credit card or your credit 
              card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much 
              the thief charges to your account.

Our Safe Shopping Guarantee
When you shop at target.com, you are protected by our Safe Shopping 
                Guarantee: If your credit card information is stolen because you 
                used your credit card to make an online purchase from target.com, 
                we'll make sure you don't have to pay any fraudulent charges made 
                to your account.
Here's how it works: 
If fraudulent charges are made to your credit card, you must notify 
                your credit card company in accordance with its rules and procedures.
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card company cannot 
                make you pay more than $50 of the fraudulent charges.
If your 
                credit card company makes you pay any part of this $50, then target.com 
                will reimburse you, up to the full $50.
Of course, we will do 
                so only if the unauthorized use of your credit card number occurred 
                because you used it to purchase something online through target.com 
                and only if you properly notified your credit card company.
