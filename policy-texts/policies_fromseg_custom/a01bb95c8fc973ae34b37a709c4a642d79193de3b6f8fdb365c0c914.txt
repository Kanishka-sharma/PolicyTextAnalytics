Sprint Privacy Policy for its high-speed Internet services
General
Sprint respects the privacy of every individual who visits our 
                  Web sites, responds to our interactive advertisements or sends 
                  us e-mail.
This Privacy Statement outlines the information Sprint 
                  will collect and how we will use that information.
This Statement 
                  will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your 
                  personal information collected or shared when you visit Sprint 
                  Websites, respond to our Web-based advertisements or send us 
                  email.

Security
All order forms on Sprint.com utilize a Secure Socket Layer 
                  (SSL) or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol to provide 
                  "secure sessions" for our visitors.
Through the "secure session," 
                  information that you input into a Sprint.com order form will 
                  be sent and will arrive privately and unaltered at a Sprint 
                  server.
This security prohibits other companies and Web users 
                  from being able to access your information.

Personally-Identifiable Information
Sprint will not collect any personally-identifiable information 
                  about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or 
                  email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.
The following are some examples of when Sprint may require that 
                  you provide personally-identifiable information:

to complete an online order for a product or service (if 
                      you do not wish to complete an online order form, we will 
                      always provide an option for you to complete an order by 
                      calling a toll free phone number) 
to enter an online contest or sweepstakes (if you do not 
                      wish to complete an online contest or sweepstakes form, 
                      we will always provide an option for you to enter by mailing 
                      a 3x5 card to a specific address)  
to request more information about new or current Sprint 
                      products or services  

If you do not want your personally-identifiable information 
                  collected, please do not submit it to us.
If you have already 
                  submitted this information and would like for us to remove it 
                  from our records, please contact us at the email address listed 
                  at the bottom of this Statement.
We will use reasonable efforts 
                  to delete your information from our existing files.
When you do provide us with personally-identifiable information, 
                  we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated 
                  otherwise:

we may store and process that information to better understand 
                      all customer needs and how we can improve our products and 
                      services for all customers  
we may use that information to contact you with new promotions 
                      and announcements if you have previously provided your permission 
                      and if the promotions and announcements are in your interest 
we may contact you if we have questions about your account 

Sprint will not sell personally-identifiable information to 
                  third parties, unless stated at the time of collection.
==========
We may 
                  share information with business partners.
We are committed to 
                  giving you the choice whether or not we use your information 
                  for marketing purposes or share information with business partners.

Children
Sprint has no intention of collecting any personally-identifiable 
                  information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email 
                  address) from individuals under 18 years of age.
Where appropriate, 
                  Sprint will specifically instruct children not to submit such 
                  information on our Web sites or advertisements without consent 
                  of a parent or guardian.
If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable 
                  information without the consent of a parent or guardian, a parent 
                  or guardian of that child should contact us at the email address 
                  listed at the bottom of this Statement if they would like this 
                  information deleted from our records.
We will use reasonable 
                  efforts to delete the child's information from our existing 
                  files.

                  you linked to our site or advertisement.
Similar to personally identifiable information, we will not 
                  sell non-personally-identifiable information to third parties, 
                  unless stated at the time of collection.

==========
