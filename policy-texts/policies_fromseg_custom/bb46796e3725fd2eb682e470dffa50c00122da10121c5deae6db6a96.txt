By registering, you certify that you are not on any list of restricted persons with whom it is unlawful for a United States company to do business.
==========
Chegg operates the majority of its Services in the United States.
Chegg makes no representations or warranties that the Services are appropriate for use or access in other locations.
Anyone using or accessing the Services from other locations does so on their own initiative and is responsible for compliance with United States' and local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent such laws are applicable.
We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Services and/or the provision of any content, program, product, service or other feature to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any such content, program, product, service or other feature that we provide.
==========
We will notify you before we exercise these rights, except when we are not required to and when required to protect our reputation, the integrity of our services or if you breach these Terms of Use.
Proprietary Rights
The Services are owned and operated by Chegg.
Unless otherwise explicitly specified by Chegg, all materials that are included in or otherwise a part of the Services, including past, present, and future versions, domain names, source and object code, the text, site design, logos, graphics, bibliographic and citation information, citation guides, icons, and book cover images, as well as the selection, assembly and arrangement thereof and the "look and feel" of the Services (collectively, "Chegg Content"), are owned, controlled, or licensed by Chegg or Chegg's third-party partners.

You may only use the Services for your own personal use.
You agree not to view, copy, or procure content or information from the Services by automated means (such as scripts, bots, spiders, crawlers, or scrapers), or to use other data mining technology or processes to frame, mask, extract data or other materials from the Chegg Content (except as may be a result of standard search engine or Internet browser usage), unless formally authorized by Chegg under separate written agreement.

For example, the Services may allow you to send certain Chegg Content to friends, display Chegg Content on your personal website or post Chegg Content on a third-party website.
You agree that you will not imply that you and Chegg are affiliated in any way or that Chegg approves of your comments.
We reserve the right to revoke our permission for Social Distribution at any time to protect our reputation, the integrity of our services or if you breach these Terms of Use, and you agree to immediately cease Social Distribution upon receiving a notice revoking our permission and to comply with any terms we post in connection with the Social Distribution of Chegg Content.
Similarly, the Services may provide content that you may choose to embed on your personal web page, third-party website or social networking site by pasting the HTML or other code provided by us (typically labeled as an embed code) ("Widgets").
Widgets are Chegg Content and subject to the limited, revocable license described above.
==========
We may discontinue providing the services necessary for the Widgets to operate or we may disable Widgets you have embedded at any time for any reason without any liability to you.
You agree that our permission to you to use Widgets does not provide you (or any third-party) with any intellectual property rights in or to the Widget or any Chegg Content made available via any Widget.
Notice to Third-Party Websites
Any Chegg Content made available in connection with your site, or otherwise, by our Widgets, third-party widgets or otherwise, is our exclusive property and no grant of any intellectual property rights is made by us.
We retain the right to demand that you cease any use of Chegg Content upon notice.
==========

Read the Digital Content Terms for each Digital Content you rent or purchase, as different Digital Content may come with different restrictions or may be updated from time to time.
If there is a conflict between the Digital Content Terms and these Terms of Use, the Digital Content Terms supersede the Terms of Use only to the extent of your use of the relevant Digital Content.
==========
User Content and Activities
When you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate, link to, email or otherwise distribute or publish any review, problem, suggestion, idea, solution, question, answer, class notes, course outline bibliographic and citation information comment, testimonial, feedback, message, image, video, text, profile data or other material ("User Content") to Chegg, any Chegg employee or contractor, or a Chegg Website, you grant Chegg and our affiliates, licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other entities or individuals authorized by Chegg, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, unlimited, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully sublicensable (through multiple tiers) and fully transferable right to exercise any and all copyright, trademark, publicity, and database rights you have in the content, in any media known now or in the future, and to make, use, reproduce, copy, display, publish, exhibit, distribute, modify, sell, offer for sale, create derivative works based upon and otherwise use the User Content.
Note that we may create, facilitate, or display social advertisements, whereby your name, profile and photo may be used to advertise products and services to your network based on your use of the Services and your interactions with Chegg.
You further agree that Chegg is free to use any ideas or concepts contained in any User Content for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services, and creating informational articles, without any payment of any kind to you.
You authorize Chegg to publish your User Content in a searchable format that may be accessed by users of the Services and the internet.
==========
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you (a) waive (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) any moral rights you may have in any User Content you submit in favor of Chegg and its successors-in-interest, even if such User Content is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you and (b) agree and consent to Chegg doing, or refraining to do, any act that would otherwise infringe any moral rights you have (to the extent that any moral rights cannot be waived under applicable law).
Chegg is not required to host, display, or distribute, and may remove at any time, any User Content.
Chegg reserves the right to change the format, sizing, and any other display specifications of the Content as it sees fit.
You represent and warrant that (i) you own the User Content submitted by you on, through or in connection with the Services, or otherwise have the right to grant the licenses set forth in this section, and (ii) the posting of your User Content on, through or in connection with the Services and/or Linked Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity.
Upon Chegg's request, you will furnish Chegg any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms of Use.
==========
Except as otherwise described in the posted Privacy Policy, or other agreement on the Services presented at the time you provide your User Content (defined below), you agree that your User Content will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and will not be returned.
You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Chegg is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any User Content does not place Chegg in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your User Content.
None of your User Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Chegg.
It is our policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials other than those we have specifically requested, to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply.
This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently.
==========
You agree that Chegg has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User Content but has the right to protect and enforce its and its licensees' rights to your User Content.
You further acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Chegg will not have any obligation to you with regard to User Content and that Chegg may or may not monitor, display or accept your User Content and may delete it at any time.
We may, but are not obligated to, review User Content prior to posting it on or distributing it through the Services, or allowing them to be distributed through the Services.
This includes private messages exchanged by you and other users through the Services.
This "User Content and Activities" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.
==========

In addition to removing such prohibited materials, Chegg may terminate the responsible accounts, and/or report such activities to law enforcement authorities as appropriate.

using the Services in a manner inconsistent with any applicable law.
==========
Service Modifications
Chegg reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes to or discontinue any of the Services at any time.
Any description of the Services provided by Chegg is not a representation that the Services are working or will always work in that manner, as Chegg is continuously updating the Services, and these updates may not always be reflected in the Terms of Use.
==========
Mobile Use
The Services may offer features and services that are available to you via your mobile device.
These features and services may include, without limitation, the ability to upload content to the Services, receive messages from the Services, download applications to your mobile phone or access features from the Services (collectively, the "Mobile Features").
We may charge for Mobile Features and these charges will be disclosed prior to completion of registration for the Mobile Feature.
==========
Also, standard messaging, data and other fees may be charged by your carrier.
Carrier fees and charges will appear on your mobile bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance.
Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Mobile Features and certain Mobile Features may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device.
Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.
==========
If you change or terminate your mobile account, you agree to promptly update your Chegg account information so that any messages or notices from Chegg regarding the Services are sent to you and not to the person who is assigned your old number.
For any of our mobile apps, you agree that the third-party store or platform through which our apps are available (including, without limitation, the Apple App Store) is not liable to you in connection with our apps.
==========
If you use any ISBN scan feature of the Services, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the scanned code before relying on it.
Notwithstanding any other provision within these Terms of Use, the following additional terms are applicable to those using any app governed by these Terms on an Apple iOS device (“App”): You understand that these Terms of Use are between you and Chegg only, and not Apple, Inc. (“Apple”), and that Chegg (or any third-party developer that may own and operate the App) are responsible for the App and the content thereof.
You further understand that the App may not be used in any manner inconsistent with the Apple App Store Terms of Service as of the date hereof.
You are granted a license to use the App on any iOS device that you own or control and as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.
==========
We are solely responsible for providing maintenance and support for the sites, as specified in these terms or as required under applicable law.
You understand that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the sites.
We are solely responsible for any warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed.
==========
In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App to you (if any); and that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of us.
We, not Apple, are responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third-party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
Our liability is limited so far as permitted by applicable law.
==========
In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of such App infringes that third-party’s intellectual property rights, we, not Apple, are solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.
You and we acknowledge and agree that Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to a United States government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and that you are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
==========
You must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the application.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the App, please contact us as described in these Terms of Use.
==========
Email and Text Message Notifications
Notifications or receipts from Chegg will be delivered to you by email at the address you provided to Chegg when you created your account or as later updated.
You may also opt to receive text message reminders from Chegg as a courtesy to you.
Please review our text message mobile disclosures, which are incorporated into the Terms of Use.
Chegg may contact you, sometimes through an automated or pre-recorded message, using the phone numbers you provide to Chegg, including wireless numbers, to remind you that rental books are due to be returned or otherwise provide the Services.
You are still responsible for compliance with the Terms of Use, including, e.g., timely return of your books, whether or not you receive such reminders via email, text or otherwise.
==========
Chegg will not ask you for your personal information, account username, and password, or any information about you or your method of payment via email or text message.
If you receive such an email or text message purportedly from Chegg, it is fraudulent and Chegg will have no responsibility for any misuse of any information you provide as a result.
==========
Account Cancellation
You may request cancellation of your account at any time throughout your use of our Services.
To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, your account will only be cancelled and closed after you have returned all books that have been rented to you (if any) and all transactions have been processed including payment of assessed penalties or the cashing of any refund check, if applicable.
Chegg may cancel your account in its sole discretion for any reason, including but not limited to inactivity or misuse.
Even if your account is cancelled, your photos, bibliographic and citation information, comments, likes, friendships, and any other data you have shared via the Services may persist within the Service after cancellation of your account (for example, if your content has been reshared by others).
==========
Payments and Payment Processing
Validation: Chegg may require users of the Services to provide a valid method of payment (e.g., credit or debit card, PayPal account, etc.) tied to an account at a financial institution when they register for an account (to ensure users are able to make applicable payments to Chegg) or upon ordering products or services.
If a method of payment is required, you are responsible for ensuring that a valid method of payment is associated with your Chegg account at all times (either the original method of payment or a replacement).
To confirm your method of payment is valid, Chegg may initiate a "pending" charge on the account.
==========
This charge will not be confirmed and, therefore, you will not be charged, and it will simply disappear from your financial statement (usually within seven days - check with your financial institution for additional information).
Please be aware that this pending charge may be initiated each time you edit the payment information for your account or place an order that cannot be processed.
==========
Authorization Holds: For certain transactions (e.g., book rentals), we may authorize anticipated charges and taxes from your method of payment.
The amount of the authorization sought will depend on the transaction and may also vary depending on the nature of the payment method you have provided.
This is sometimes referred to as an authorization hold and these funds may not be available for your use.
==========
If the fees incurred exceed the authorization hold (e.g., because of an auto-extension or unreturned, lost, stolen, or damaged book), we may automatically request additional authorization holds.
If the provider for your method of payment rejects any authorization, you agree that we may charge any other method of payment we have on file for you (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law).
At the conclusion or termination of an ongoing transaction (e.g., return of a rented book), if the charges do not exceed the amount due, the authorization for the amount not utilized will be released per the rules of your payment method provider.
The timeframe for an authorization hold to be removed will depend on the policies of your financial institution.
You are responsible and liable for ensuring that enough funds are available in connection with the payment method used at the time any transaction is processed.
Other Policies: Where your billing address is requested, you must provide the address and phone number your financial institution has on record, as well as the card's security code (e.g., CVC, CVV, CID).
Chegg will make reasonable efforts to process your transactions in a timely manner, but we make no guarantees regarding the processing time for charges.
==========
Chegg may store your method of payment and you hereby acknowledge and agree that Chegg may charge you for, and you will pay for, any charges specified on the Services and for any auto-extension or unreturned, lost, stolen, or damaged books associated with your account under the terms of your book rental and in accordance with the General Policies.
For any books or other materials kept beyond the applicable rental term, you agree to be charged the applicable late fees as set out in our General Policies.
For any books or other rental materials that are never returned (an item is deemed "never returned" if it has not been returned in the period posted in our General Polices) or that are returned damaged, you agree to be charged for the value of the item(s) as set out in our General Policies.
==========
Chegg reserves the right to place you into collections if you fail to timely pay for the products and services ordered through the Services; collections may be done by Chegg or a third-party on Chegg's behalf.
You also agree that we may, at our discretion, send your account to a collection agency, and except where prohibited by local law, recover our reasonable costs of collection from you, if you fail to pay all fees due and owing to Chegg.
For security reasons or to otherwise confirm a financial instrument or payment, Chegg may delay mailings of books or otherwise delay providing payments or services even if such delay impacts a guaranteed delivery date.
==========
Third-Party Links, Content and Applications
There may be links from the Services, or from communications you receive from the Services, to third-party websites or online features.
The Services also may include third-party content that we do not control, maintain, or endorse.
Functionality on the Services may also permit interactions between the Services and a third-party website or online feature, including applications that connect the Services or your profile on the Services with a third-party site.
For example, the Services may include a button enabling you to indicate, on your social networking page, that you "like" a specific product on the Services, or a feature that lets you post to your social networking page a link to a specific product or the ability to share content from the Services or your User Content with a third-party, which may be publicly posted on that third-party's website.
Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party website.
We do not control any of these third-party sites or any of their content.
Neither Chegg nor its service providers are responsible for the practices of any third-party.
Accordingly, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we make no representations or warranties about the completeness, accuracy, or existence of any advertising, products, or other materials on or available from third-party sites or online features and any reliance placed by you on such materials is at your own risk.
YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PAYMENT AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND ANY TERMS, CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SUCH DEALINGS, ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD-PARTY.
==========
Linking Policy
Chegg grants you the revocable permission to link to the websites on which these Terms of Use are posted; provided, however, that any link to such a website: (a) must not frame or create a browser or border environment around any of the content on such websites or otherwise mirror any part of such websites; (b) must not imply that Chegg or the Services are endorsing or sponsoring any third-party or its products or services, unless Chegg has given the third-party prior written consent; (c) must not present false, misleading or offensive information about Chegg or its products or services; (d) must not use any Chegg trademarks without the prior written permission from Chegg; (e) must not contain content that could be construed as distasteful, offensive or controversial or otherwise objectionable; and (f) must be owned and controlled by you or the person or entity placing the link, or otherwise permit you to enable such link subject to these Terms of Use.
By linking to a Chegg Website, you agree that you do and will continue to comply with the above linking requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms of Use, Chegg reserves the right to prohibit linking to any Chegg Website for any reason in our sole and absolute discretion.
Course Searches and Other Information Specific to an Academic Institution
We may tie your Chegg experience to information about the school you have identified to Chegg.
For certain schools, the Services enable you to search and retrieve information about the materials required for particular courses.
==========
Please be aware that course information and assigned materials may change from time to time, and Chegg may not receive updated information from the school in a timely manner.
Chegg is not responsible for any errors in the information provided in the course searches on the Services.
==========
Where specific school names or information relate to a specific school are displayed, they do not imply any endorsement or approval by the school.
Except where specifically stated, Chegg has no affiliation with nor endorsement from any academic institution, and school names and information are used on the Services only to the extent necessary to organize, identify and permit use of information and sections of the Services that may be tailored to students of a particular school, or for other lawful uses.
Categories of Users
You may use Chegg's homework help services as a "Member" or a "Visitor."
==========
"Members" may include a variety of designated levels of members who may be charged for services according to the terms of the particular offer or registered free members (a "Free Member") or other membership levels.
"Visitors" are users that have not registered for an account with access to and use of certain aspects of the homework help services, which may be restricted and only available to certain Members.
==========
The membership levels, the benefits and pricing of each level of membership may vary and are subject to change at any time, please read the terms of any particular level of membership carefully before accepting it.
Chegg may modify these levels and benefits from time to time, and each such modification is effective as soon as we post it on the relevant Services except to the extent that your particular pricing structure is established in writing for a period of time in the future, such as an annual plan.
It is therefore important that you review the membership page regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes.

Homework Help, Study Guide and Note Usage
Chegg's homework help, study and note services are available merely as informational and study aids and should not be considered substitutes for applicable coursework, homework, class and lecture requirements, assignments, and related materials.
In using the Services, you specifically agree not to use, claim, or submit as your own any portion of the help materials.
Chegg does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of answers or other study material that appear on the Services, some of which may be posted by other users.
You further agree the Services may present information that is incorrect or inconsistent when compared to similar content and materials, including solutions and their methodologies, provided, or preferred by publishers of applicable problems or instructors of applicable courses.
Outlines, Study Guides and Notes
Chegg may permit users to upload and in some cases sell content for the purpose of aiding others in the education and learning process.
==========
Users may not post content owned or created (except if it is in the public domain) by another person and hereby represent and warrant that: (i) each was created by the user and the user is the sole owner of all content posted to Services sites and all rights in such content (except for public domain content), including, without limitation, copyright and (ii) the posting of Content on or through the Services will not breach the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third-party.
Users agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing to any third-party for any content provided by you to the Services.
==========
Users of the Services agree to exclude from such content any documents, records or files made accessible to them by (a) your school, professor or other instructor, (b) any board of examination, (c) any author or publisher whose works have been used as part of studies or (d) any co-student.
In creating study related content, students must respect any intellectual property rights that others may have in content.
==========
All content posted on the Services must be independently created, transformative and non-derivative.
It should not be a transcript or recording of another's independent efforts, nor should it copy from materials purchased from or created by others.
==========
It should go beyond simply summarizing material covered in class or in written or recorded materials, but include information raised by students in or outside of class, and independent thought, analysis, and commentary.
Class notes, for example, must be substantially rewritten after class and include independent thought and analysis, research and information; notes that use a lecturer's words or that are not carefully reviewed, rethought and rewritten after class are not useful to or appreciated by students, and not permitted on the Services.
==========
Schools may have their own policies that place restrictions on a student's ability to make commercial use of study materials, even otherwise lawful materials that the student has independently created.
You are responsible for becoming familiar with such policies, abiding by them, and discontinuing the use of any Services if such use is contrary to your school policy or the instruction of your professor.
==========
Class notes and study guides are solely for the specific use of students in the designated class for which they are created.
Individuals who are not registered for a class may not purchase study guides, class notes or outlines for that class.
Check the accuracy of all information from study guides, class notes, answers, and outlines – to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg does not guarantee their accuracy or completeness, they are simply an aid to the study process.
==========
Career Information and Jobs
Chegg's site may help students identify potential careers by providing a basic description for a variety of potential jobs.
In some cases, Chegg may provide salary ranges for jobs, and point users to potential job opportunities in that field, based upon your interests and skills that you have represented to Chegg that you possess.
Chegg may also help identify skills that are commonly required for those jobs and recommend learning materials that (combined with your own efforts) may help you achieve better proficiency with those skills.
Chegg's attempts to assess your skills, identify gaps, and match those gaps to available learning materials may not be accurate in your particular circumstances.
Chegg is simply one starting point, not an exhaustive list of all potential jobs or opportunities that might be available to you, and in a fast-changing employment landscape Chegg does not guarantee that the descriptions, salaries and job opportunities set out on our site are always up to date, reflect the current job market, or are applicable to the market in your area.
We believe that the materials on our site, if you use them and apply yourself, can improve your skills and employability.
Still, Chegg does not provide in-depth, individualized job counseling, and your success in landing a job in a particular career depends on a wide variety of factors.
Our system's efforts to identify skills gaps, and recommend learning materials to address those gaps, may not result in improved employment prospects; completing recommended classes is not a guarantee of finding employment in that field or any other field.
==========
Chegg may also help students or alumni find internships or entry level jobs or other positions by accepting postings of job descriptions from third-party employers, through its Internships.com website or other Chegg Websites.
Chegg does not confirm the accuracy of the postings, nor can Chegg know whether a particular position has been filled.
Chegg may recommend particular job postings to particular users based upon available data about the position or the user, or other criteria, but the actual criteria for job positions lie within the discretion of the employer and Chegg makes no representations about the suitability of any candidate for any listed position.
==========
Learning Courses
Chegg may offer third-party learning videos and instructional material.
Chegg does not hire or employ Instructors.
We are not responsible for the content of such third-party materials, nor the advice provided in such materials.
==========
We do not control such materials and, as such, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, do not guarantee their reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness.
Completing such courses may provide you with skills and experience that may help your career prospects, but as noted above, there are a large number of factors tied to your career and completing such courses is no guarantee of improved employability or enhanced career prospects.

Reporting Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Violations
Chegg respects the intellectual property rights of others and takes the protection of copyrights and other intellectual property seriously.
Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content.
If you believe your work has been infringed through the Services, please notify us at Chegg, Inc., Attention: Copyright Agent, 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054, 408-855-5700, CopyrightAgent@Chegg.com.

A reasonably specific description of where the allegedly infringing material is located on the Services (including, e.g., the URL);
A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the allegedly infringing material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
Your electronic or physical signature;
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf; and
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party.
==========
NOTE: This contact information is for inquiries regarding potential copyright and other infringement only.
It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met.
We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material.
If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter.
Chegg will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third-party complaint of alleged infringement of the third-party's intellectual property rights.
IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT MATERIAL IS OR IS NOT INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES.
THESE INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED BY CHEGG, BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER, OR BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER'S LICENSEE THAT IS INJURED AS A RESULT OF RELIANCE UPON YOUR MISREPRESENTATION.
YOU MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY.
==========
You agree we may provide your notice to the provider of the allegedly infringing material.
We have a policy of terminating accounts of users who repeatedly and intentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
==========
Informal Dispute Resolution
There might be instances when a Dispute (as defined under “Dispute Resolution” below) arises between you and Chegg.
If that occurs, Chegg is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.
You and Chegg agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome.
Except to the extent prohibited by applicable consumer protection law, you and Chegg therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration or against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference").
==========
If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.
The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of his or her intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.
Notice to Chegg that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to legal or regular mail to our offices located at Chegg, Inc., 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attn: General Counsel.
The notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, email address associated with your account and your account username; (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your claim.
==========
The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a claim, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree otherwise; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree otherwise.
In the time between a party receiving notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s claims.
Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.
The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.
==========
THE FOLLOWING “DISPUTE RESOLUTION,” “CLASS ACTION WAIVER,” AND ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS IN QUEBEC, OR IN ANY OTHER PROVINCE OR TERRITORY IN CANADA, AND ARE INTENDED TO ONLY APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
TO THE EXTENT THE BELOW “DISPUTE RESOLUTION,” “CLASS ACTION WAIVER,” AND ARBITRATION PROVISIONS DO NOT APPLY TO YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE PROHIBITED UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS IN QUEBEC OR ANY OTHER PROVINCE OR TERRITORY IN CANADA, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TERMS OF USE OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (“CANADIAN DISPUTES”) SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND EVALUATED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF YOUR PROVINCE OR TERRITORY OF RESIDENCE, AND THE FEDERAL LAWS OF CANADA APPLICABLE THEREIN, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.
YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION TRIBUNALS OR COURTS IN YOUR PROVINCE OR TERRITORY OF RESIDENCE AS THE PROPER AND MOST CONVENIENT FORUM FOR ANY CANADIAN DISPUTES.
==========
Dispute Resolution
If a dispute arises between you and Chegg, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.
Accordingly, you and Chegg agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between us arising out of or related to the Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, of the Services or your use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be finally settled by individual binding arbitration in accordance with this “Dispute Resolution” section, and not in a court of law.
This “Dispute Resolution” section shall also be referred to as the "Arbitration Agreement."
==========
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court, if the claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate Disputes in a court of competent jurisdiction if you provide Chegg with written notice of your desire to do so by email to legal or regular mail at our offices located at Chegg, Inc., 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attn: General Counsel within thirty (30) days following the date you first receive these Terms of Use ("Arbitration Opt-out Notice").
Such notice must include your full name, address, Chegg username, the email address you currently use to access your Chegg account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
If you do not provide Chegg with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within this thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute in court except as expressly set forth with respect to individual actions in small claims courts.
You acknowledge and agree that you and Chegg are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
==========
An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms of Use as a court would.
However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
==========
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.
Class Action Waiver
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Chegg agree to waive the right to have any Dispute within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, collective, or mass action basis, and as such all disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class, collective or mass basis, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear, arbitrate or resolve any claim on a class, collective, and/or mass action basis, or to award relief to anyone but the individual in arbitration ("Class Action Waiver"), or to consolidate arbitrations, except as provided in the Batch Arbitration section below.
If, however, this Class Action Waiver is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular Dispute, or if the Class Action Waiver is not permitted in your jurisdiction of residence, neither you nor Chegg will be entitled to arbitration of such Dispute.
If a court determines by means of a final decision not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the Class Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief, or if the Class Action Waiver is not permitted in your jurisdiction of residence, you and Chegg agree that that particular claim or request for relief may be adjudicated in court, but shall be severed and the court proceeding stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.
This Class Action Waiver does not prevent you or Chegg from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
Commencing the Arbitration, Arbitration Rules, Governing Law
If the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process above does not resolve satisfactorily the Dispute within 60 days after receipt of the notice, you and Chegg agree that either party shall seek to finally resolve the Dispute through binding individual arbitration.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this section of these Terms of Use.
(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org.)
==========
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a Request for Arbitration (the "Request").
The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, email address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username as well as the email address associated with the account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference as described above; and (5) the party’s portion of the applicable filing fee.
If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address and email address.
Counsel must also sign the Request.
By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
==========
The Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions, except where your jurisdiction states local law prevails.
The parties acknowledge that the Terms of Use evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and that notwithstanding the provision in the preceding sentence with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. ("FAA") will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.
If for whatever reason the FAA is inapplicable, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.
Except as follows, the arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, scope, applicability, enforceability, validity, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement.
The exceptions to the preceding sentence are (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the Class Action Waiver, including any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or such Class Action Waiver has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (3) all Disputes arising out of or relating to whether either party has satisfied the condition precedent of engaging in the pre-arbitration Informal Dispute Resolution Conference discussed in the “Informal Dispute Resolution” section above, shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
The parties agree that any and all due dates for arbitration fees shall be suspended, and no action for unpaid fees shall lie, while any Dispute arising out or relating to the Class Action Waiver, the payment of arbitration fees and/or the pre-arbitration Informal Dispute Resolution Conference are being resolved.
==========
Arbitrator
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process is triggered (as described below), the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.
Arbitration Location and Procedure
Unless you and Chegg otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000 United States dollars, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Chegg submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000 United States dollars, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
The arbitrator has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claims or counterclaims.
Batch Arbitration
You agree that any and all Disputes not resolved by the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process will be finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the AAA Rules then in effect, except as modified herein.
==========
Fees will be assessed based on the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filings fees then in effect.
To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Chegg agree that in the event that there are 100 or more individual Requests of a similar nature filed against Chegg by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms or organizations within a 30 day period (or otherwise in close proximity), the AAA (1) will administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of case management fees and arbitrator compensation due per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award ("Batch Arbitration").
==========
All parties agree that Requests are of a “similar nature” if they arise out of the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.
To the extent the parties disagree on the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the Batch Arbitration process’ applicability ("Administrative Arbitrator").
In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.
==========
The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Chegg.
You and Chegg agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration approach including the payment of single case management fees and arbitrator compensation for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.
This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this section.
==========
Arbitrator's Decision
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA rules.
The arbitrator's award will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
==========
The arbitrator's awarding of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration, you may seek an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
Chegg will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party.
The arbitrator may consider, but under no circumstances is the arbitrator bound by, decisions reached in separate arbitrations.
==========
Fees
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing fees, case management fees and arbitrator compensation will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules (see Costs of Arbitration).
However, if the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), Chegg shall have the right to seek recovery of any AAA filing fees, case management fees and arbitrator compensation it has paid.
==========
Invalidity, Expiration, and Termination
If any part or parts of this "Dispute Resolution" section are found to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the "Dispute Resolution" section shall continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.
This "Dispute Resolution" section shall survive any expiration or termination of these Terms of Use or your relationship with Chegg.
You agree that any Dispute that you have with Chegg as detailed in this "Dispute Resolution" section must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.
Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.
Changes
Chegg reserves the right to change the "Dispute Resolution", “Class Action Waiver”, “Informal Dispute Resolution”, and arbitration sections.
If Chegg changes any such section after the date you first accepted the Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Terms of Use), it will notify you.
==========
You agree that your continued use of Services will be deemed acceptance of those changes.
If you do not agree to such changes, you may reject any such changes by sending us written notice (including by email to legal) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date.
In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name, address, Chegg username, the email address you currently use to access your Chegg account and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to such sections.
==========
Chegg’s updates to the "Dispute Resolution", “Class Action Waiver”, “Informal Dispute Resolution”, and arbitration sections do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of the Terms of Use and did not validly opt out of arbitration.
If you reject any change or update to such sections, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate disputes arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use, Services or your use of the Services, the provisions of such sections as of the date you first accepted the terms of these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use) remain in full force and effect.
Chegg will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of the Terms of Use.
==========
Updates to the "Dispute Resolution", “Class Action Waiver”, “Informal Dispute Resolution”, and arbitration sections will not change your standing with respect to any litigation between Chegg and you that is already pending in a federal or state court or an arbitration as of the date these updated Terms of Use go into effect (as indicated in the "Last Updated" date).
Updates to such sections will apply to any litigation or arbitration between Chegg and you that is commenced after these Terms of Use go into effect (as indicated in the "Last Updated" date), including in relation to events, circumstances or claims that pre-date this update, unless you validly opt out as described above.
==========
Policies
When using the Services, you are subject to any posted policies or rules applicable to features you use through the Services, including without limitation the General Policies and all policies referenced in the General Policies or elsewhere in this Agreement.
All such policies or rules are hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use.
==========
These policies may change from time to time.
Privacy Policy
Please refer to our Privacy Policy (https://www.chegg.com/privacypolicy) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users.
==========
You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy
List Prices
The list prices displayed on the Services for publications come from bibliographic information we receive from leading third-party sources and publishers.
Each list price is the publisher's suggested retail price.
To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg is not responsible for errors in that third-party data, including prices for the sale or purchase (buyback) of books.
If a title does not have a publisher's suggested list price, the Services may not show a list price in the online catalog.
==========
If a product is listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error or an error in pricing information received from our suppliers or for any other reason, Chegg shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law), whether or not the order has been confirmed and your method of payment charged.
If your method of payment has already been charged and your order is canceled, Chegg will issue a credit to your method of payment.
Chegg Credit
From time to time, Chegg may issue you "Chegg Credit."
Upon providing you Chegg Credit, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg may place limits on its use, and Chegg Credit may not be moved from one Chegg Service to another.
==========
If provided to you in exchange for goods or services or as a refund, it will not expire, though we may with notice after a posted period of time convert your credit to cash and send it to your address of record.
If the credit was given to you with terms explicitly authorizing redemption for cash, you may convert that credit to cash.
If you receive a credit from customer support, you may not redeem it for cash.
Chegg Discount Codes, Bonuses, Coupons, Loyalty Programs, Points Programs and Other Promotions
From time to time, Chegg may offer discounts, bonuses, coupons, loyalty programs, points programs, sweepstakes, contests or other promotional incentives.
==========
These incentives typically have their own specific rules, restrictions, and limitations (e.g., limiting when, how often, and under what circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion).
You are responsible for carefully reviewing and complying with these applicable rules, restrictions, and limitations.
==========
You agree not to engage in any self-dealing, collusion, smurfing (defined as breaking large orders or sales transactions into multiple individual transactions for the purpose of obtaining multiple discounts or payments), or otherwise gaming or defrauding the system.
By participating in such promotions, you agree to be bound by the applicable rules and restrictions, and that Chegg, in its sole discretion, may deny payment or benefits to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (e.g., when it believes improper activity has occurred or when a code has expired).
All promotions may expire at any time without notice to recipients.
Discounts apply only toward the actual base product/service rental or purchase cost; they do not apply to taxes, shipping, extension or late fees, or any other additional fees (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).
==========
Return of Digital Access Codes
Through the Services, you may purchase, as a separate product, a digital access code (DAC) to certain Digital Content.
The DAC publishers allow only one user (one activation) of these codes.
==========
Chegg will ship your ordered DAC to you in sealed packaging.
If the DAC packaging is opened, Chegg must assume that the code is activated and therefore cannot be resold.
Thus, you may not return a DAC with opened packaging for a refund.
==========
Tax
Rentals and purchases through the Services may be subject to taxes in many jurisdictions.
Depending on your jurisdiction and the nature of the product or service you receive from us, this may be a rental tax, sales tax, use tax and/or value-added tax.
Tax rates are different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
You are responsible for paying all such taxes and all prices quoted on the Services are (except to the extent expressly indicated otherwise) exclusive of applicable taxes which may apply in your jurisdiction.
Supplemental Materials
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that supplemental materials (CDs and CD-ROMs, Workbooks, Study Guides) will be included with book rentals.
==========
However, they are available for purchase on select titles.
If you receive your rental book with any of the above items, you are welcome to use it.
We ask that you return your book complete with any supplemental materials you received.
==========
Asset Ownership
All rentals remain the property of Chegg, or third-party partners for physical text books, even while the item is in your possession.
You may be given the option to purchase rented books from Chegg or third-party partners, either at the end of a rental cycle or at any point during the rental cycle.
If you wish to purchase a book you have rented through the Services, you may be able to do so by accessing your account on the Services and looking for the purchase option.
==========
In this case, title (ownership) transfers to you as soon as your method of payment is approved for purchase value.
If you purchase the title through our purchase program, title (ownership) changes hands when we or our third-party partners provide the book to the shipping company.
Certain digital products may not be available for purchase or may have different purchase terms, and you should review their specific terms prior to rental or purchase.
==========
Certain Payments and Renewals
Payment for certain Services is due in advance of each applicable membership period (e.g., monthly or annually).
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LOCAL LAW, MONTHLY AND ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOU WILL BE CHARGED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD UNTIL YOUR MEMBERSHIP IS TERMINATED BY US OR CANCELLED BY YOU.
IF ANY OF OUR CHARGES ARE REJECTED FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU HAVE INDICATED IS YOUR PREFERABLE PAYMENT METHOD, YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION: (I) RETRY SUCH PAYMENT METHOD; AND/OR (II) COLLECT FROM ANY OTHER PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOU.
Also, for some of our paid Services, you may be able to temporarily "suspend" your membership, for example, during school breaks or vacation, for up to a total of 90 days in any one membership year (i.e., during each 12-month period following the commencement of your membership), and the period of your membership will be extended by the total amount of such suspended period(s).
==========
You agree to pay all applicable fees for your memberships and use of our paid Services, plus any applicable taxes or other charges as may be required, when due and payable.
All fees and charges are payable in advance and non-refundable, including after cancellation, unless otherwise disclosed at the time of purchase.
==========
If you wish to cancel your membership in a Service (if available), please visit the customer support web area on the Services.
Cancellation of memberships (if available) will take effect as detailed in the cancellation information for the specific Service you want to cancel.
Free Trial Memberships
Where permitted by local law, we may from time to time offer free trials for some of our Services.
Such trials may require you to register with a valid credit card to commence.
==========
Users that sign up for a free trial membership at a particular level will be automatically renewed at the promoted membership rate for that level at the end of the trial period unless the user cancels the membership at least before the end of the trial, unless the terms of the offer explicitly state otherwise.
You can cancel a free trial online on the Services or by contacting Chegg's customer support.
After cancellation of a free trial, you may be able to continue as a Free Member with reduced benefits or access.
Only one free trial membership is allowed per person.
Subsequent registrations do not qualify for free trials.
Unless the terms of a promotion state otherwise, for promotions that include "free" periods with "paid" periods, paid periods will elapse first.
We may introduce new or additional features, services or materials to the Services which may be a part of, or priced separately from, existing levels of membership at our sole discretion.
==========
Chegg Honor Code
You agree to abide by our Honor Code Terms, available here.
A Message to Students
As current and former students, the Chegg team understands the pressures and time constraints school creates.
That being said, we also know from the unfortunate tales of our peers that the risk you take by violating your school's code of academic integrity is not worth the reward.
==========
Copying solutions or posting unexplained final answers promotes completion without comprehension, and that's something we don't support on the Services.
A Message to Educators
We are always seeking opportunities to work with educators in making our Websites a valuable resource for both you and your classroom for years to come.
If you need to contact us concerning an issue of academic integrity, please email us at on Honor Code.
==========
Miscellaneous
Unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use, if any provision of the Terms of Use is declared to be wholly or partially void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision is severed to the extent that it is void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable and all remaining provisions continue in full force and effect.
The failure of Chegg to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use is not a waiver of such right or provision.
The section titles of the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Non-performance of either party, except for the failure to make required payments, will be excused to the extent performance is delayed or rendered impossible by any reason where failure to perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party.
==========
This "Miscellaneous" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.
Changes
Chegg may modify the Terms of Use including the linked policies contained herein from time to time ("Updated Terms").
You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Chegg Website so that they are accessible via a link on the home page, and that your use of our Services after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify), you agree to be bound by the then-current version of the Terms of Use, including any changes we may have made since the last time you used our Services.
==========
It is therefore important that you review the Terms of Use regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes.
The updated Terms of Use will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms of Use and will apply to your use of the Services from that point forward.
==========
Entire Agreement
The then-current Terms of Use, including (a) any related policies and terms referenced in the Terms of Use and (b) any Additional Terms, are the entire agreement between you and Chegg regarding the Services.
The Terms of Use may not be modified without the consent of a duly authorized representative of Chegg and will supersede and prevail over any terms or conditions you may include with any purchase order or other transaction document or communication with us, regardless of whether Chegg signs them or fails to object to them.
This "Entire Agreement" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.
==========
Contacting Chegg
