We may share Personal Information internally, including with affiliated companies that may have different privacy policies.
When we do this we require the affiliated company or companies to protect the Personal Information in a way consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We may also combine Personal Information with data derived from an application that has a different privacy policy.

The relationship between AT&T branded companies can typically be identified through the use of the AT&T name or brand, the use of the AT&T "globe" logo, or through advertising, cross-promotional offers, or widely reported news or information in the press or social media that highlights the company as an AT&T affiliate Button Icon (like Xandr and our highly publicized merger with the Time Warner family, now called WarnerMedia).
Affiliated companies that are not publicly recognized as part of the AT&T family of companies are treated as though they are non-AT&T companies for purposes of information sharing under this policy.
