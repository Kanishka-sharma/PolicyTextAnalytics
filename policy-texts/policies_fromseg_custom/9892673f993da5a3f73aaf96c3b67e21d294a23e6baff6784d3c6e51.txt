Optanon Auditor Data Collection
The Optanon Auditor plug-in for Google Chrome gathers data about cookies and submits it to our database.
This data contains information both about the cookies found, and the pages on a particular site they were found on.
It also contains values of cookies, which in some circumstances may contain personally identifiable information - if the cookie is designed to hold such information.
Such information is only ever used to help us identify the purpose of a cookie, where a website owner has requested this service from us.
The data may also be provided to the owner of a website if they request it.
We do not use any personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and nor do we make it available in any other way.
==========
All submissions of data via the Optanon Auditor plug-in are otherwise completely anonymous.
No information is collected about the device the plug-in is installed on, or the person using the device.
No browsing history, other than a record pf pages that set cookies, is complied, and no profile linked to a device can be created from the data.
The names and some attributes of the cookies gathered by the auditor are made publicly available on the Cookiepedia website.
However there is to our knowledge no personally identifiable information contained within this data.
Cookie Collector Plug-ins 
Aside from the Optanon Auditor there are two Cookie Collector plug-ins in circulation which submit data about cookies to our database.
Although the old Chrome Collector is no longer available for download, a Firefox Cookie Collector extension is still available in the Mozilla Add-ons store.
Both plug-ins if installed will submit data about cookies to our systems.
==========
They do this automatically, without any kind of user input, feedback or control.
The Collector submits only names of cookies and their other attributes, along with the top level domain name of the site being visited by the browser, when the data was submitted.
The values (contents) of the cookies are not stored, nor the specific pages of the site they were found on.
==========
Therefore no personal data is collected.
We do not identify the source of the data submitted - so it cannot be used to build up a browsing history of any person using the Collector.
The sole purpose is to source data about cookies to inform our research.
Statistics and other intelligence garnered from analysis of this data are published freely on Cookiepedia.
==========
Disclosure of your information
We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

If Cookie Collective LLP or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Cookie Collective LLP, our customers, or others.
==========
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Your rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes.
You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.
==========
You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998.

Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
==========
Links to Other Websites
We may from time to time publish links to other websites we believe to be of interest.
