DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE;
    NO WEB ACCESS »

SourceForge.net is a website owned and operated by VA
      Software Corporation ("VA"), for the purpose of fostering
      software development and content creation under Open-Source
      Initiative ("OSI")-approved licenses or other arrangements
      relating to software and/or content development that may be
      approved by SourceForge.net (the "Purpose").
SourceForge.net
      currently offers users access to a rich collection of on-line
      resources for Open Source software development and content
      creation, including various communications tools, source code
      control and project management tools, online forums, shopping
      services, personalized content and branded programming
      through its network of properties (collectively, the
      "Services").
To use the Services, each user must
      independently obtain access to the World Wide Web, either
      directly or through devices that access Web-based content,
      and pay any and all service fees or equipment costs
      associated with such access.
4.
==========
REGISTRATION
    OBLIGATIONS »

If required by SourceForge.net, each user must: (a)
      provide true, accurate, current and complete information on
      the Service's registration form (collectively, the
      "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the
      Registration Data as necessary.
If, after investigation, we
      have reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's
      information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
      we may suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit
      any and all current or future use of the Services (or any
      portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly
      provided herein.
Each user will receive a password and account designation
      upon completing the Service's registration process and is
      wholly responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
      thereof and wholly liable for all activities occurring
      thereunder.
==========
SourceForge.net cannot and will not be liable for
      any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to comply
      with this Section, including any loss or damage arising from
      any user's failure to (a) immediately notify SourceForge.net
      of any unauthorized use of his or her password or account or
      any other breach of security and (b) ensure that he or she
      exits from his or her account at the end of each session.
SourceForge.net handles user Registration Data in
      accordance with the SourceForge.net Privacy Statement
      accessible at http://sourceforge.net/tos/privacy.php.

CONTENT »

All information, data, text, software, music, sound,
      photographs, graphics, video, messages or any other materials
      whatsoever (collectively, "Content"), whether publicly posted
      or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the
      person from which such Content originated.
This means that
      the user, and not SourceForge.net, is entirely responsible
      for all Content that he or she uploads, posts, emails or
      otherwise transmits via SourceForge.net or any Service.
No
      user shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or
      participate in any activities on SourceForge.net and/or any
      Service which, in the judgment of SourceForge.net, is likely
      to be prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction,
      including laws governing the encryption of software, the
      export of technology, the transmission of obscenity or the
      permissible uses of intellectual property.
SourceForge.net will not pre-screen or review Content, but
      SourceForge.net reserves the right to refuse or delete any
      Content of which it becomes aware that it reasonably deems
      not to fulfill the Purpose.
In addition, SourceForge.net
      shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole
      discretion to refuse or delete any content that it reasonably
      considers to violate the Terms or be otherwise illegal.
SourceForge.net, in its sole and absolute discretion, may
      preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to
      do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as
      reasonably determined useful by us to protect the rights,
      property or personal safety of SourceForge.net, its users and
      the public.
==========
SourceForge.net does not control the Content
      posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the
      accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content.
Under no
      circumstances will SourceForge.net be liable in any way for
      any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any
      errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage
      of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content
      posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via SourceForge.net
      or any Service thereon.
Each user, by using SourceForge.net or any Service, may be
      exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or
      objectionable.
Each user must evaluate, and bear all risks
      associated with, the use of any Content, including any
      reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such
      Content.
