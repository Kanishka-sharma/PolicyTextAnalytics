When you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we believe you would like to see.
For example, you may receive advertisements for Tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that sell children’s clothing or school supplies.
==========
And from that information we may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested in a powerful laundry-cleaning product.
In this way, we intend to send you relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you.We learn from groups of consumers sharing similar
interests
We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same
interests.
==========
For example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados” if
we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a
“bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts or
sales.
We notice these things about you as you look at web pages, links you
click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications you
use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails.
==========
We group
together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends, habits,
or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly online
and/or offline.
By doing this, we can find and serve many others who “look
like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we believe will be
relevant and beneficial product offers and information.We link other information to your cookie and device IDs
Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such as
information about the products you buy offline or information that you provide
directly to us when creating an account on our sites.
==========
We generally do this in
ways that will not directly personally identify you.
For example, we could know
that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor aficionado group based on person’s
web site visits, age, gender, and shopping habits, but we would not know that
person’s name or address or other information that would identify him or her as
a person.
Should we ever want to personally identify your cookie or device
information (web and app viewing history), we will always ask you before doing
so.We may know you across all of your computers, tablets,
phones, and devices 
We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be
connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with device
ID EFG15647.
This means that you may search for diapers on your laptop, click
on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later see an
ad for our Pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone.
==========
We might assume or
deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone because, for example,
they sign on to the same WiFi network every day at the same time.
Understanding
what devices seem to be used by a person or household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across all of your devices.
==========
And this is important because that way you don’t get annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive.
How you can stop receiving traditional interest-based ads
To stop receiving P&G interest-based advertising, you can click here  or click on the AdChoices icon on one of our sites.
Please make sure to opt out of all of our advertising partners:TapadTradeDeskMediaMathNeustarFacebookAmazonGoogleLiverampYou can also prevent getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in
your browser(s).
declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually present when you install them, or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.
==========
Please note that you may also receive personalized ads based on your email address or phone number, if you have provided those to us for marketing purposes.
To opt out of that usage, please
contact us.You will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads
Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from our brands on your computer or mobile devices.
These ads, however, are based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads.
Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile phone or computer viewing activities, contextual ads are ads shown to you based on the context of the specific site you are visiting.
For example, you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly new or expecting parents as visitors.
You should also know that we may still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer research, or detecting fraud.
==========
Deleting cookies also deletes your opt out
When you opt out of interest-based advertising, we send an opt-out cookie to your browser that tells us that you no longer want to receive interest-based ads from us.
Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you decide to delete all cookies.
This means that you will need to opt-out again if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.
==========
Facebook’s Advanced Matching
Some of our sites use Facebook’s Advanced Matching features, which is a service they offer to advertisers.
Through Advanced Matching, we will send some of
the information you enter into our site form fields (e.g., your name, email
address, and phone number – not any sensitive or special category data) encrypted
in hashed format to Facebook, or the Facebook pixel will encrypt and pull that
data automatically, for the purpose of helping associate you with your browser
cookie or device ID.
We do this so that we can better target and measure the
effectiveness of our advertising on Facebook’s platform.
This is how we can
know that if we showed you an ad on Facebook, you clicked on it, came to our
site and bought something – or not – and therefore whether we should continue to
buy ads on Facebook – or not.
