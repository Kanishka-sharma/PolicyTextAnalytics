==========
Sociomantic Labs (referred to as “Sociomantic,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is an online advertising technology company that helps advertisers to deliver more relevant online display (banner) advertisements using anonymous, non-personally identifiable information.
Sociomantic’s online advertising technology helps our clients to deliver more relevant online advertisements.
This section of the privacy policy refers to your interactions with our online advertising technology.
If you are interested in learning more about how these technologies work in general, we recommend starting at one of these sites:
IAB Europe’s Your Online Choices site
IAB’s Privacy Matters site (learn about online behavioral advertising)
Digital Advertising Alliance’s AboutAds site
Additionally, Sociomantic adheres to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“EDAA”) principles.
Types of Anonymous Information (non-PII) Collected
Our online advertising technology collects and stores only non-PII data, which is accessed using cookies.
==========
These cookies are saved to your web browser to help us collect information such as the web pages visited by your browser, the advertisements clicked, the items viewed in an online shop or added to an online shopping basket, etc.
We also collect information on the performance of the ads delivered, for example how many times an ad was shown to a particular browser, whether or not the ad was clicked, and if that click resulted in an online purchase.
How the Information is Used
The information we collect is used to help make the ads you see more relevant to you.
We do this by showing you ads based on your previous online actions and other dimensions we have assigned to your browser based on the non-PII we have collected.
This helps to reduce the amount of “spam” advertisements you see as you browse the web, and it enables advertisers to connect to people who would be most interested in their offering.
==========
Storage and Retention of Data
Sociomantic Labs has taken reasonable measures to encrypt and keep secure all of the data we collect.
This data is stored for a finite amount of time within the bounds of German law and in compliance with international standards.
Controlling the Use of Your Information

The provision of your personal data to government institutions is only possible within the framework of the national law of the Federal Republic of Germany or in compliance with international governance.
We may also share your information for the following purposes:
as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
if Sociomantic is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
