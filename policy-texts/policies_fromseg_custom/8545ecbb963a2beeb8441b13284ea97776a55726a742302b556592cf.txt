You have the right to request that we delete any personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records.
However, we may retain information that has been de-identified or aggregated.

==========
In any access or deletion request that you make pursuant to this notice, you should include your full name, e-mail address, and clear instructions regarding changes and/or information you are requesting in sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.
In addition, we ask that you please provide sufficient information to enable us to reasonably verify that you are the person (or an authorized representative of the person) regarding whom we collected the personal information.
Generally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.
==========
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
In order to protect the security of your personal information, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity (or, in the case of an authorized representative, authority to make the request) and confirm that the personal information relates to you.
With respect to any requests to delete your data, once we receive and verify your request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception under applicable law applies.
==========
If we cannot comply (in whole or in part) with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply.
We will respond to consumer requests in a reasonably timely manner.
If we require extra time to respond, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you use an authorized agent to exercise the right to opt-out, you must provide the authorized agent written permission to do so, and we may deny the request if the authorized agent does not submit proof that it has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
==========
Note – Subject to applicable law, opting out through this mechanism will not prevent your personal information from being shared with third parties for non-marketing purposes (for example, to process one of your transactions).
Further, this opt out mechanism will not prevent the transfer of personal information in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets.
