Teads offers an advertising marketplace that proposes innovative advertising solutions to publishers and advertisers all over Europe, the United States, Latin America and Asia.
Publishers use Teads’ advertising solutions to monetize their ad spaces either directly or through Teads advertising demand including other advertising buyer partners.
Advertisers or their intermediaries (e.g. media agencies) display their advertising campaigns through Teads advertising solutions on the websites or apps of our publisher partners.
Teads advertising technology collects and uses data to help make online advertising more relevant as well as for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
Scope of this privacy policy
Teads SA., together with its affiliates (“Teads”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) recognizes the importance of privacy and is committed to providing transparency and control over the use of the data in online advertising.
This privacy policy details Teads’ data practices on how we collect, use, process and share the data we may collect through our advertising services (collectively, the “Services”) as well as the ways in which individuals may exercise control over the use of information collected by us.
This privacy policy does not describe Teads’ data practices relating to information Teads collects through its website www.teads.com, and only pertains to Teads’ Services.
Your use of the Services is also governed by the Terms of Use.
As used herein, “personal data” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular Teads customer or consumer or his or her household.

User identification
We do not collect or process information related to (i) name, user address, place of work, date of birth, email address, or phone number, (ii) hardware-based identifiers such as UDID or MAC Address or (iii) sensitive targeting categories as defined by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) in the European Economic Area (EEA) and under other applicable law (e.g. religion, political opinion, health).
In order to deliver personalized ads as well as non-personalized ads, Teads uses the following 3 methods to identify users depending on the device they use, whether they access our Services on web or mobile, and operating system:
Cookie-based identification
Teads drops a cookie on the user web and/or mobile browser.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are created on your device through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies are used to identify a user and store a randomly generated identifier to identify his or her browser across visits.
Cookie-less environments
For browsers setup to not allow cookies to be dropped, Teads uses an identification methodology based on IP address non-reversible encryption, browser, and device characteristics.
This method allows Teads to identify a user in order to provide the same level of services, such as reporting and targeting information to users, segmenting users, and capping the number of times the same ad is shown to the same user.
Advertising ID
Teads uses its software development kit (“SDK”) technology to identify your advertising ID for mobile applications.
For Google Android operating system, we use the Google Advertising ID and for Apple iOS the IDFA.
==========
You can opt-out of the use of these technologies as described in Section 9.
