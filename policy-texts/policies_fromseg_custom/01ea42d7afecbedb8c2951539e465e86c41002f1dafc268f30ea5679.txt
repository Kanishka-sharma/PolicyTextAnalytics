Slickdeals Terms of Service
Effective Date: November 16, 2016
Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using our website, www.Slickdeals.net (the "Site").
These Terms govern your use of the Site, and are a legally enforceable contract between Slickdeals LLC ("Slickdeals" or "we") and you.
If you don't agree with these Terms, please do not use the Site.
We may make changes to these Terms at any time by posting them to the Site.
Any changes will be effective at the time of posting.
==========
Accounts
In order to use certain services on the Site, you will need to create an account.
All the information you provide when you create your account must be true, accurate, current and complete.
You are responsible for all activity in your account, so please secure and protect your login information and password.
==========
Offers
You will find third party coupons, deals, advertisements and other offers on the Site ("Offers").
Offers are for products and services provided by third parties (each, a "Seller"), and if you choose to accept an Offer, the transaction will be between you and the Seller.
Slickdeals has affiliate relationships with certain Sellers, and may receive compensation for your purchase from these Sellers.
Slickdeals is not a party to, or in any way responsible for, your transaction with a Seller, including when we have an affiliate relationship with Seller.
==========
We are not responsible fulfilling any Offers.
Slickdeals may allow you to accept Offers or make other purchases from Sellers on our Site, using our checkout tools.
While our platform helps facilitate your purchase, the transaction is solely between you and the Seller.
You will need to contact the Seller directly for customer service issues, including questions about the products or services for sale, order status inquiries and refund requests.
Slickdeals does not provide any warranties or other protections for your purchase.
Before you purchase a product or service or otherwise accept an Offer, please read the entire description of the Offer, including the fine print and any additional terms and conditions set forth on the Seller's website.
==========
You are responsible for understanding what you are buying and for following the Seller's instructions.
The terms and conditions of Offers, including refund and cancellation policies, are governed by the Seller's policies, not ours.
Please contact the Seller directly for questions regarding the Offer or your transaction with Seller.
