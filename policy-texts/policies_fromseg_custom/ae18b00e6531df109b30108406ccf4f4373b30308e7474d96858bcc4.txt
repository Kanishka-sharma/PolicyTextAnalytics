1.
WHAT IS A COOKIE?
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device.
They are widely used in order to make websites work or work in a better, more efficient way.
They can do this because websites can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).
==========
The types of information typically collected by cookies include information relating to your use of the ZD Sites, your device's IP address and browser type, how you arrived on one of the ZD Sites, your name and email address if you are logging in, etc.
Cookies come in two main categories, and then a number of sub-categories.
The two main categories are persistent and session cookies.
==========
Persistent cookies stay on your device for a limited period of time after you have visited the ZD Sites and are reactivated the next time you visit.
Session cookies are deleted from your device when you leave the ZD Sites.

WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?
Below we list the different types of cookies used on the ZD Sites.
Essential Cookies.
These cookies are essential to the ZD Sites in order to enable you to move around them and to use their features.
Without these absolutely necessary cookies, certain aspects of the ZD Sites would not work.
No information about your browsing habits is gathered by these cookies.
==========
Cookie name Further information
PHPsessid Used to provide breadcrumb navigation, that is, to help users track their location within all ZD Sites (except as described below for the sites that use different Essential Cookies) and to allow them to navigate back to previous pages.
You can control these cookies via your browser setting, but please note that the ZD Sites may not function smoothly if you do.
ASP.NET_SessionId Same as the PHPsessionid, but used on ToolBox.com
JSESSIONID Same as the PHPsessionid, but used on Techbargains.com
zm%5Fuser Same as the PHPsessionid, used in addition to the PHPsessionid on pcmag.com when a user logs in

Functional Cookies.
==========
We use functional cookies to remember how you like to use the ZD Sites and to personalize them accordingly.
We can't identify you personally through the use of these cookies, nor do these cookies track your browsing habits, but they do help us serve you with ads.
Analytics Cookies.
Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the ZD Sites, and enable us to improve the way it works.
For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the ZD Sites, help us record any difficulties you have with the ZD Sites, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not.
==========
This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the ZD Sites, rather than the use of a single person.
Some of the analytics cookies we use may be operated by third parties.
Accepting analytics cookies is a condition of using the ZD Sites.
By continuing to use the ZD Sites, you agree we can place analytics cookies on your device.
We can't identify you personally through the use of these cookies; we just use them for statistics.

Behavioral Advertising Cookies.
The ZD Sites use Ziff Davis proprietary technology.
In the UK, on occasion we use nugg.ad AG (www.nugg.ad) technology.
Ziff Davis:  We use cookies and other technology to collect information about your visit to the ZD Sites (“Online Data”).
==========
We analyze what pages you visit on these sites, what products or services you view, and whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you.
We use this information to send you interest-based ads.
All such data is also collected anonymously and aggregated with other data we collect and/or similar data collected by third parties to create segments, groups of users, and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data, and a general geographic location derived from your IP address, and (b) the pages you view and links you click when using certain search services.
We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests.
We will engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of this Online Data, and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
These efforts do not result in the collection of personally identifiable information such as name or address, and we do not intentionally collect sensitive data such as financial, health or medical information.
==========
This Online Data is retained for not more than 180 days, after which it shall expire.
There is an exception for situations in which the same user subsequently visits a ZD Site; in that case, the 180 day period will start over.
If you do not want ZD to collect this information click here.
==========
Nugg.ad:  In the UK, nugg.ad saves the frequency of use of various website topics in the form of cookies.
These cookies are stored in the browser of your device for a maximum period of 26 weeks.
nugg.ad's technology may also save basic information on your use of other Internet websites in order to estimate what advertising might interest you the most.
If you would like to see advertising on Internet sites that are of interest to you, then you can opt in to receive a further theme-based analysis of your usage behaviour.
==========
If you give your consent, then this opt-in cookie will also be stored in the browser of your device.
It will be stored for one year.
If previously collected nugg.ad cookies are present in the browser of your device, by setting the Opt-In cookie the following will happen: With your permission, the nugg.ad cookie lifespan is lengthened to one year (calculated from the moment the cookie is set).
Information stored on nugg.ad cookies prior to Opting-In is retained and will be deleted upon the expiration of cookie (maximum one year).
You have the right to prevent the recording of information by the nugg.ad system at any time by exercising your right to opt out.
If you have already given your consent, you can also cancel it at any time, effective thereafter.
An opt-out will also be stored in a cookie in your browser's device with a lifespan of 10 years; it will be named "nuggstopp,” and will be set by "nuggad.net.”
For further information about nugg.ad's privacy policy, please go to this section of the nugg.ad website.
==========
The topic monitor will show you how your interests are estimated on the basis of your previous surfing behavior.
This site also contains an option to not have nugg.ad analyze your surfing behavior, or you may choose the option to see advertising that is relevant.
Please note the following: If you wish to prevent the nugg.ad system from monitoring your data, the Opt-Out cookie (named “nuggstopp”) must remain in your browser’s device.
If you decide to delete all the cookies on your device or use a different browser, you will need to visit the nugg.ad website again and repeat the opt-out process.
Other Cookies.
Some of the cookies on the ZD Sites are operated by third parties, such as Twitter, YouTube or Facebook.
We do not control these third parties or their use of cookies.
This means it is not possible for us to manage these cookies.
Please check the websites of those third parties for details on how they use cookies.
Flash Cookies.
==========
We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation.
To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as "Flash cookies") are employed to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences.
Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.
This means it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level, in the same way you would manage cookies.
==========
Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's website directly.
The Adobe website provides comprehensive information on how to delete or disable Flash cookies—see Adobe's website for further information.
Please be aware that if you disable or reject Flash cookies for this website, you may not be able to access certain features, such as video content or services that require you to sign in.

You may refuse to accept cookies from websites at any time by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse cookies.
Further information about the procedure to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider's website via your help screen.
