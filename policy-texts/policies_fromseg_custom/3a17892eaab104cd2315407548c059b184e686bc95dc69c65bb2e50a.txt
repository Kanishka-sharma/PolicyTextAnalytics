At Piriform we take privacy seriously and want you to be happy that we won't give your email address to anyone else.
:)
Here's how we handle the small amount of mainly anonymous information we collect.
All of our procedures are governed by the United Kingdom Data Protection Act of 1988.
==========
What Information Do We Collect?
Some information about you we collect passively - information that your computer and your browser send automatically while you browse our site.
Other information we actively solicit, such as your email address when you subscribe to our newsletter.
We collect these types of information from site visitors:
Site usage information

Site Usage Information
We use cookies and log files to track our users and may analyze the data to provide a better experience for site visitors.
Cookies are small text files that are written to your hard drive by your browser and help the site 'remember' who you are.
For example, when you register for forum access and log in, the site writes a cookie to your computer so that you don't need to log in again if you come back within a certain period of time.
==========
Log files tell us generally about the visitors to our site - general geographic regions, length of visits, pages clicked on, and so forth.
We can't tell who you are by examining our log files, except as anonymous users.

==========
Feedback
We encourage you to provide us with feedback in the form of emails or forum posts.
When you email us or use the Contact form, we maintain the anonymity and privacy of your message.
==========
We keep these messages on file for a period of one month, and then delete them permanently.
Forum posts are generally visible to all site visitors, and may be archived or deleted as necessary.

This information is kept confidential.

==========
Newsletter Registration
If you choose to sign up for the Piriform newsletter, we will send you an email confirmation to ensure that you in fact requested the newsletter, and to avoid unwanted emails.
Your email address is always kept confidential, and we will only use it to send you newsletters or special announcements.
You may unsubscribe at any time and details on how to do this are included in every email.

Donations
We encourage and appreciate donations via PayPal, so that we can continue developing software.
If you donate to us, we will receive receipts which include your email address and may include other information from PayPal, but we do not receive any credit card details from PayPal.
PayPal have their own privacy policies which govern when you are using their sites to make donations.

Purchases
If you purchase one of our products, the payment will be handled by a 3rd party payment gateway, http://www.cleverbridge.com.
They will collect information about you, such as your name and address and credit card details.
They only share the minimum with us that we need to set up your account with Piriform.

We hate spam.
We will never spam you with any unsolicited email, and we will never sell information you have given us to other parties.
