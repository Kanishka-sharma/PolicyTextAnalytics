ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Top
YOU SHOULD READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
Scope: You and Branch agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.
==========
Initial Dispute Resolution: You may contact us at info@branch.io to address any concerns you may have regarding the Discovery Services.
Branch is able to resolve most concerns quickly to our users’ satisfaction.
==========
You and Branch agree to use best efforts through Branch’s internal dispute resolution processes to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations, which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the initial dispute resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the exceptions and terms set forth below.
Except as set forth below, any claim that you might have against Branch must be resolved through binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) using its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by AAA and resolved by a single arbitrator.
==========
The AAA rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitrator is bound by the Terms herein.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms, you and Branch are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.
In the absence this arbitration provision, you and Branch might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.
==========
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing.
For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America.
==========
You and Branch further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Northern District of California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
Costs of Arbitration: Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against Branch and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then Branch will advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then Branch will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse Branch for all such cost and expenses that Branch paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.
==========
Class Action Waiver: YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BRANCH WILL EACH ARBITRATE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS.
This means that you and Branch may not join a claim with any other person or entity, and there shall not be authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions in this section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
==========
Exceptions: Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (meaning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
==========
Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Branch Metrics, Inc., 1400 Seaport Blvd, Building B, 2nd Floor, Redwood City, CA 94063.
The notice must be sent within 30 days of November 15, 2018, or your first use of the Discovery Services, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Branch also will not be bound by them.
==========
Changes to this Section: Branch will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by updating these Terms, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are using the Discovery Services.
Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are updated on these Terms or sent to you.
Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.
If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Discovery Services.
==========
Governing Law.
These Terms and all matters arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
Venue.
Any legal action or proceeding relating to these Terms and not subject to arbitration shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the Northern District of California.
==========
You and Branch hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, those courts in any such legal action or proceeding.
Service of Process.
You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
==========
No Waiver.
Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.
Assignment.
==========
These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Branch’s prior written consent.
Branch may transfer and assign any of its rights and obligations under these Terms freely and without consent.
==========
Statute of Limitations: You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or related to the Discovery Services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.
Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
==========
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this statute of limitations shall not apply to residents of New Jersey.
Section Headings: The section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
==========
Entire Agreement.
These Terms, together with the Discovery Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or additional terms and conditions or policies governing use of the Discovery Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Branch concerning the Discovery Services.
Except as explicitly stated herein, if any provision of the Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.
==========
We may change this Discovery Privacy Policy at any time in our sole discretion.
We will post all changes to this Policy on this page and will indicate at the top of the page the modified Policy’s effective date.

Last updated March 9th, 2020
We value privacy and are committed to providing our services in a privacy-first way, including by practicing data minimization, limiting the information we disclose, and implementing measures to safeguard our data.
==========
At a high level, our Discovery Services allow our Customers to provide their Users with more relevant results in response to search queries.
To provide these services, we collect certain technical data (e.g., IDFAs, IP address, and geolocation information) and search data (e.g., “best restaurant in San Francisco”) about Users.
We use this information to provide and improve the Discovery Services, as well as to provide other Branch products and services, and generally to serve or communicate with our Customers.
We may also de-identify or aggregate data we collect through the Discovery Services and use it for any purpose.
We disclose information to our service providers and Customers and also to comply with laws, to protect ourselves and others, or as part of a business transaction.
Users may opt out of certain data collection by following the instructions in the User Choices section below.
Because we are a service provider to our Customers, they may use a different name to describe their use of Branch’s Discovery Services (for example, “Place Search”).
Users should review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use, which may give them additional options or rights regarding how our Customers use their data.
Branch Metrics, Inc. ("Branch", "us" or "we") offers a discovery service (the “Discovery Services”), available in the United States and India only, that enables developers of mobile applications and device features using the Discovery Services (our "Customers") to provide contextual results and intent-based links in their apps, which gives their end users ("Users") simplified access to completing an action (for example, to identify nearby restaurants).
Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
==========
This Branch Discovery Privacy Policy (the “Discovery Privacy Policy”) explains what information Branch uses to provide the Discovery Services, and how it shares and protects data obtained by Branch through the Discovery Services.
Please note that this Discovery Privacy Policy only applies to the Discovery Services.
==========
Branch also offers a website and other services, some of which may be accessible by Users who, through their use of the Discovery Services, click on a Branch link or interact with an app or website of a Branch customer.
For the privacy policy applicable to the Branch website and other Branch services, including services accessible by Users through the Discovery Services, please review the Branch privacy policy posted here.
The Discovery Services, and the Branch services described in the Branch privacy policy, are collectively the “Branch Platform”.
What are the Discovery Services?
Branch provides technology so Customers can provide their Users with content results in response to queries.
We do this in two main ways.
First, Branch leverages data from Users through the Discovery Services and through other Branch services to enhance and tailor results in response to queries.
==========
Second, Branch provides Customers with mobile deep linking technology to return deep links to queries.
“Deep linking” means providing links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed, piece of content in an app or on a website (e.g. “https://branch.io/security/”), rather than the app’s landing page or website’s home page (e.g., “https://branch.io”).
Deep links thus enable Users to be directed to specific content within an app.
==========
Branch has no direct relationship with Users.
When Customers install the Branch technology on their apps (via an application programming interface and/or software development kit), the technology enables Customers to respond to Users’ queries with contextual results and intent-based deep links, which in turn helps Users by giving them results and deep links to simplify access to completing an action (for example, to identify nearby restaurants, order food for delivery, travel to a location, or find a contact on their device).
==========
What Information Does Branch Collect from the Discovery Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect from Users through the Discovery Services.
We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
==========
In addition to the information summarized in the charts below, through the Discovery Services, we collect your queries and, when you have enabled geolocation tracking, your geolocation information.
We require that each Customer commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained and that it has the right to share information with Branch.
We strongly discourage Customers from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Discovery Services.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Discovery Services.
Information Collected by the Discovery Services
Software development kits (“SDKs”) and application programming interfaces (“API”) include code that allows Customers to integrate and use the Discovery Services.
The Branch Discovery Service SDKs and APIs collect the following information when Customers use the SDKs and APIs in their mobile apps, some of which is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”):
Information Collected Purpose

==========
IP Address Used for matching, and to understand general location to serve more relevant results and advertising.

Please see the User Choices Section below for more information about opting out of geolocation tracking.
==========
Query
Any query submitted by a User for purposes of responding to the User’s queries.
Queries may include information that identifies an individual (for example, if a User searches for a friend “John Smith” or for news about a particular celebrity) as well as information that does not identify anyone (for example, “pizza nearby” or “phone cases”).
Queries may be Internet-based or device-based (for example, to search for a contact or an app on a User’s phone).
For Internet-based queries, we collect the information described in this table.
For device-based queries, our SDK will collect and store information locally on a User’s device (for example, a User’s contacts or the apps stored on a User’s device), but Branch does not receive this data.
==========

Device Manufacturer Used for identification and matching.
==========
Operating System Used for identification and matching.

All categories of information we collect may be shared
The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information.
Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months.
Instead, any information we share is limited to as set forth in the “How does Branch Share Information?”

section of this Privacy Policy.
California Rights and Choices
Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California Consumers have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect about you and to delete that information, subject to certain restrictions.
==========
You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.
This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.
==========
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
Right to request access to your personal information
California Consumers have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell.
You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you and can associate with you.
==========
However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information.
Right to request deletion of your personal information
You may also request that we delete any personal information that we collected from you.
However, we may retain personal information necessary (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.
==========
Additionally, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you.
If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.
==========
How to exercise your access and deletion rights
Subject to restrictions under applicable law, California Consumers may exercise their California privacy rights by submitting your request to us, or by contacting us at discoveryprivacy@branch.io.
Because Branch cannot associate the personal information collected via the Discovery Services with a particular individual or household, it is not reasonably possible for Branch to verify the identity of any particular consumer.
To comply with CCPA’s security requirements, we therefore can only respond to requests for the categories of personal information we collect, but we cannot provide you with specific pieces of information collected about you or delete your personal information.
Right to nondiscrimination
We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.
Submitting CCPA Requests
If you are a California Consumer, contact us at discoveryprivacy@branch.io.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
