Our Policy


            This privacy policy governs the interactions between Survata, Inc.
("Company", "we", "us" and/or "our") and  individuals ("respondents",
            "you", "yours") who engage with a survey across Company's Network of
            publishers ("Network").
The Network is operated by Company to collect
            survey responses from respondents on behalf of Company's clients.
This
            Privacy Policy sets forth Company's policy with respect to information
            collected from respondents across the Network.
Information We Collect


            When you interact with us through the Network, we may collect information
            from you ("Response Data"), as further described below:
            
Survey Responses

            When you engage with a survey on Company's Network, you are granting Company
            permission to transfer and store your survey responses.
These responses may
            be provided and/or sold to 3rd parties, such as the Company's customers.
==========
Survey Response Metadata

            You also grant Company permission to transfer and store the "metadata" of your
            survey, including but not limited to: your operating system, your web browser,
            the time you completed each question of the survey, the amount of time it took
            you to complete each question of the survey, the IP address from which you engaged
            with the survey, and the geographic location from which you engaged with the
            survey.
All of the Survey Response Metadata, with the exception of your IP
            address (covered below), may be provided and/or sold to 3rd parties, such as the
            Company's customers.
==========
Personal Data

            We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from you.
Your IP address is used to determine approximate geographic location only, and is never
            shared with 3rd parties.
==========
We do not
            run surveys across our Network that ask for any Personally Identifiable Information via
            a survey question.
Company is not responsible for any special handling of Personally
            Identifiable Information that you submit unsolicited via a "free response" survey question
            on the Network.
==========
By voluntarily providing us with the Response Data described above, you are consenting
            to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If you provide Response Data,
            you acknowledge and agree that such Response Data may be transferred from your current
            location to the offices and servers of Company and the authorized third parties referred
            to herein located in the United States.

Use of Cookies


            In operating the Network, we may use a technology called "cookies."
A cookie is a piece

            access the Network.
Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Network and
            help us analyze Network usage more accurately.
For instance, our Network may set a cookie
            on your browser that allows you to bypass engaging with a survey due to your previous
            completion of a survey.
In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal
            Data except with your permission.
On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on
            the toolbar.
Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification
            when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
We recommend that you
            leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the
            Network's features.
==========
