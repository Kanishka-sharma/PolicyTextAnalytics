To better protect your privacy, we provide this web site privacy policy explaining our information practices.
This privacy policy covers the information we collect on this web site, which is designed to provide information to potential business partners.
What kind of information do we collect on this web site?
Intent IQ clients are businesses, not individual consumers.
==========
As a result, this web site is designed to provide information to, and in some instances, collect Personally Identifiable Information from our business partners and prospective business partners who request information or services from us.
We also collect Non-Personal Identifiable Information about web site visitors, as follows:

Personally Identifiable Information: Personally identifiable information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person, such as name, telephone number, company, physical address, or email address.
Intent IQ only collects personally identifiable information on this web site when visitors voluntarily provide such information.
For example, visitors may choose to provide us with their personally identifiable information while corresponding with us via email, or via a web form located on this web site.
It is not necessary to provide any personally identifiable information on our web site.
Non-Personal Information: Intent IQ technology is used to collect non-personal information about visitors to this site.
We use that information to better understand how our web site is being used as well as to present visitors with relevant advertisements on different sites and apps visited or used by them on their different devices.

How do we use the Personally Identifiable Information collected on this web site?
If you voluntarily choose to provide your email address or other personally identifiable information to us, we will use that information to respond to your question or request and to send you information about Intent IQ.

We will share your personal information with affiliate companies and companies that provide services to us.
We will not sell your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, except in connection with the sale or merger of Intent IQ or a division of Intent IQ.
See “Changes to this policy” section below.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law, when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Intent IQ.

What types of security procedures are in place?
The security of your information is very important to us.
Intent IQ follows generally accepted industry standards to protect your personally identifiable information.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
