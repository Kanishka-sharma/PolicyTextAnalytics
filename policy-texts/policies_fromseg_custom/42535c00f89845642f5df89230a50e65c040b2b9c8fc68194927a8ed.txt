We do not rent, sell or disseminate personal information to third parties for promotional purposes without consent.

BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING AND YOUR CHOICES
Because the effect of “Do Not Track” signals remains unclear, and there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a “Do Not Track” signal from your browser.
Nonetheless, there are many ways to opt-out of the use of Rubicon Project technology for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements.
Please see our advertising technology privacy policy, located here, should you wish to do so.
