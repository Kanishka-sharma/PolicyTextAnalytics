We do business under the name RUN and RUN DSP, and our clients are primarily online advertisers, website owners, data providers, and other businesses that utilize our services.

As an individual accessing content on the Internet, you will likely interact with our Technology.
However you interact with our Technology (as a consumer/individual, client, or other user) this privacy policy is intended to help you understand the kinds of information we collect, how we collect information, how we use and disclose collected information, and how you can control, correct and/or update the information.
What We Do
Our Technology is used to connect advertisers with consumers who are interested in their product.
By analyzing consumer data and targeting ad placement, we are able to optimize the performance of an ad campaign for an advertiser while providing a more relevant and meaningful online experience for consumers who view the ads we deliver.
==========
We process Anonymous Data in the United States, as well as Personal Information that we collect only from our own website (www.runads.com).
How We Do What We Do
We collect, store and analyze anonymous information about your interaction with a website or ad and serve future ads to you based on that analysis.
We collect this information using cookies, pixel tags, or similar technology to record and store anonymous information about your interaction with the ad, the website, and/or our Technology.
==========
This exchange occurs when you visit a website or view content on the Internet, whether by computer, smart phone, gaming console, or other Internet-enabled device, and you view an advertisement that our Technology sent to that device or website.
The information we collect can include the type of device (for example, a computer, tablet, smart phone, or game console), the date and time of your visit, the type of browser you used (for example, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.), the web pages you visited when viewing an ad served by us, and whether or not you interacted with that ad (for example, whether you clicked on the ad and the content you viewed).
Your Privacy and our Policy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users like you.
==========
We support industry self-regulation and adhere to applicable industry guidelines.
RUN is a member in good standing of industry associations that establish best practices in the area of online advertising, including the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) and the Mobile Marketing Association.
Our Privacy Policy covers how we treat information that we collect and receive through our Technology as well as how you can control, correct and/or update the information.
The information includes Non-Identifying Personal Information ("Anonymous Data"), IP Address, and may include Personal Information.
==========
RUN's Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by third-party advertisers, website owners, data providers, or other parties that we may do business with, or other parties linked to or otherwise accessible via our Technology.
The information collected or received by any third-party or provider is subject to their own privacy policies.
Collection of Information
Personal Information
Personal Information is information relating to you, such as name, street address, and email address.
In the course of delivering an ad to you, RUN does not collect Personal Information from you.
However, if you engage RUN from it's website, you may be asked to provide Personal Information, such as when requesting media information, or making an inquiry about the RUN FUND, or any other communication with RUN.
If you enter into a business relationship with RUN, we may require that you provide us with Personal Information for administrative purposes, such as invoice/payment processing, account management, etc.
If you do provide us with Personal Information, your information will be used only for the purpose for which it is submitted.
==========
Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Anonymous Data")
Non-Personally Identifiable Information, often referred to as Anonymous Data, is information obtained when you visit a website or view content on Internet-enabled devices (e.g. computer, smart phone, tablet, gaming console, etc.) and view an advertisement that we've sent to that site or device.
RUN may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to record and store anonymous information about your interaction with our Technology, most commonly known as "click-stream data."
The association is made with your device's Internet browser or content delivery software and the click-stream data is collected when you view an ad we delivered to that site or device at the request of one of our clients.
The click-stream data can include information such as device type (for example, a computer, tablet, smart phone, gaming console, smart/connected TV), the date and time of your visit, browser type, web pages visited when viewing an ad, and information on your interaction with our Technology when viewing content on your device's Internet browser, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what content you viewed (which advertisement we delivered to you).
For example, if you visit a number of auto websites, you may be flagged as being interested in purchasing an automobile.
==========
For Anonymous Data that we collect, directly or indirectly, we typically employ the use of "pixel tags" and/or "cookies."
Pixel tags are small bits of code that reside on a webpage and provide a method of information delivery allowing the operator of the page or a third party to collect information about the visitors to the page.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on the browser of your computer that uniquely indentify your browser and provide information to the cookie sender.
==========
We use pixel tags, cookies (and similar technology) and our servers to store non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data we collect along with data received from third party data providers, publishers and other partners we work with.
This data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range, but cannot be tied to an individual and is stored in an encrypted format within our cookies and/or on our servers.
Like most Internet sites, we use cookies to enhance a user's experience on the Web.
We cannot use them to personally identify you and they do no damage to your operating system or files.
If you want to refuse cookies or receive an alert when a cookie has been placed on your browser, you may be able to do so by changing your browser settings.
For Anonymous Data that we obtain from third party providers (such as behavioral and demographic data), the privacy policy for each of those third party providers applies to their collection and use of that Anonymous Data.
Our use of that Anonymous Data, however, is governed by this Policy.
==========
IP Address
IP Addresses are the fundamental method for computers and other Internet-enabled devices to identify themselves on most computer networks.
Every computer (or other device) connected to the Internet has its own IP Address.
Typically the IP Address information is automatically sent to us by your internet browser software each time we deliver an ad to a site on which you are viewing content.
IP Addresses assist us in reporting to our clients the number of ads served in a particular geographical area, as well as selecting an appropriate ad, based on geographic region, ISP provider, and other information such as web browser, to deliver to the consumer.
==========
Data Collection on Behalf of Our Clients
In the course of delivering an ad to you, RUN does not collect Personal Information from you.
However, we do collect certain Anonymous Data from users in order to display relevant advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of ads on behalf of our clients.
We may also obtain Anonymous Data from third-party sources that collect and make available information such as behavioral, contextual and demographic data, and may combine it with the Anonymous Data we have collected.
We use this Anonymous Data to create data segments, and these data segments are generally based upon the websites that you visit.
Using the previous example, if you visit a number of auto websites, you may be flagged as being interested in purchasing an automobile.
==========

Personal Information

RUN has established reasonable safeguards consistent with industry standards and applicable law, to help prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or destruction of the information we collect (the "information data").
While we are committed to ensuring the security of the information data, you should be aware that no data protection measures can provide 100% guarantee of security.
Consequently, we do not warrant or guarantee the security of the information data in our possession.
