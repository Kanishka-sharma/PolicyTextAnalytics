Cookies and Related Technologies
When you use our Sites, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs.
As you use our Sites and applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.
The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices.
These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.
For example, when you visit our Sites, Groupon and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices.
Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience.
They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud.
A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Sites.
Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Sites.
==========
Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.
“Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.
Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser.
"Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser.
We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences (e.g., the cities for which you want to be shown GROUPONs).
==========
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.
When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.
These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
==========
We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.
For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Sites, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device.
Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers.
Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Sites.
An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet.
==========
We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Site and the website you visit after you leave our Site, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information.
For example, we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Sites and understand its traffic and usage patterns.
In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information.

In that case, this Privacy Statement governs how we use that information.
Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically.
If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Statement governs how we would use that information too.
