Comcast High-Speed Internet ServicePrivacy Policy



Collection and Use of Information



Comcast will use basic customer information from you to provide the Service.
When you sign up for the Service, you are required to provide your name, address, telephone number and appropriate billing information.
That information is available only to authorized Comcast personnel for installing, maintaining, and billing you for the Service.
Comcast will use information that you give us to offer a more customized online experience.
==========
For example, since we know your zip code we can deliver local weather information on the home page as well as a home page of localized news or content tailored to interests that you specify.
Comcast or third party content and commerce providers may send promotional email messages to specific groups of people based on our database of customer information (for example, customers living in a specific geographic area).
However, when sending messages tailored to a specific group, the actual names and personal information about individual customers is not disclosed.
While Comcast reserves the right to send out administrative mailings to all its customers (for example, changes in pricing or operating policies), you can advise us that you don't want to receive promotional mailings and we will honor that request.
==========
Comcast or third party content and commerce providers may collect and use billing and shipping information when you purchase goods online.
Billing and shipping information may include your name, email address, shipping address, and credit card information.
This information is necessary to deliver the service or product to you.
When you use a credit card, the basic payment information is transmitted to the appropriate financial institution for purposes of processing the transaction.
==========
If you are concerned about the reputation and trustworthiness of any third party content or commerce provider, we encourage you to check their privacy policies.
Comcast or third party content and commerce providers may use personal information if you participate in a contest.
If you enter a contest, you may be required to provide information about how we can contact you.
This information will be used to contact you if you win the contest, and aggregate information may be used for marketing or research purposes.
==========
However, like other information you provide to Comcast, personal details about you will not be shared with others or used to send you promotional email messages if you indicate you do not wish to receive them.
Comcast may share aggregate information such as the number of customers who match certain statistical profiles (e.g., the number of customers in various parts of the country).
Comcast may from time to time share such aggregate information, or create reports for our advertisers based on aggregate information we collect, but we will not provide them with personal information unless we have received your consent first.
While it is our general policy to refuse to make personal information about you available to government entities in the absence of a legal requirement to do so, Comcast will release personal information if compelled by a lawfli court order.
==========
Where we have a legal requirement to disclose personal information, we will notify you before providing the requested information if we are required to do so by law.
Comcast may release personal information in accordance with our Acceptable Use Policy.
What Comcast will not do with information about you



Comcast will not share personal information with advertisers, content provider, other providers of unrelated services or other outsiders without your consent, unless we are compelled to respond to a court order or legal process in accordance with applicable law.
==========
Comcast will not read your outgoing or incoming email, private chat or instant messages.
We do store email messages on our computer systems for a brief period of time and could be compelled to disclose the messages along with personal information to comply with a valid court order or if we believe that a state of emergency exists where it is necessary to disclose this information to protect Comcast's property or an individual's safety or security.
Comcast will not send promotional email messages to you if you ask us not to do so.
We do send promotional messages to our customers from time to time.
However, we will stop sending you such messages if you advise us that you no longer wish to receive them.
Comcast will not share personal information about where you go on the Service or on the Web.
==========
We do, however, review this information in aggregate form to better understand how the Service is being used and to help us determine the popularity of our various Service features.
Comcast will not record any information that you provide to any Web site other than ones operated by Comcast.
However, Comcast's Privacy Policy does not apply to Web sites operated by persons or organizations other than Comcast.
You should review the privacy policy of the Web sites you visit to learn how they treat your personal information.
Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), Comcast will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen without first obtaining parental consent.
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and telephone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.
Comcast will implement all of the applicable requirements of COPPA, including these related to parental notice, consent and access, in connection with the collection or use of personal information about children under the age of thirteen.
==========
What is spam and why might you continue to receive it


In the online world, unsolicited junk mail is referred to as "spam".
Nearly all of us at one time or another will find spam in our email inboxes.
Unfortunately, there is no current solution to completely prevent the delivery of spam.
==========
Spammers find your email address in a number of ways.
For example, you may have offered your email address at a non Comcast Web site where you signed up for a product or service or maybe you posted a message to a discussion board and included your email address.
Some spammers may also send massive amounts of email to various Internet domains simply based on large lists of possible names and email addresses.
This allows spammers to get mail out to people who have not provided their names or addresses.
Your best bet is simply to delete the email from your inbox.
Comcast is not responsible for spamming activity and cannot stop it from occurring, especially when it originates outside of our network domain.
Comcast's Acceptable Use Policy prohibits use of the Service to deliver spam.
==========
What information is stored in "Cookies"


Cookies are small files stored on your computer's hard drive to simplify and improve your Web navigation experience.
A Web site may store information about your computer configuration so that it can more efficiently provide information to you the next time you visit.
Or, your browser might save a text file with your username and password so that a Web site's server will recognize you the next time you access the site.
This allows you to return to a site without having to log on each time you visit it.
Comcast uses cookie files to identify your locale and time zone so that you can access information for your local area.
==========
Additionally, we use cookies to deliver personalized content based on preferences you've previously chosen on our service.
We do not store your name or other personal information in cookies.
Tips on how to protect your privacy and safety in cyberspace:


Never provide any information to a Web site that doesn't post a privacy policy unless you have reason to trust that site.
Keep your passwords private.
Children should be instructed not to give out their passwords to anyone other than their parents.
==========
Never say anything in a public chat room or a forum (newsgroup) that you don't want the public to know about.
Be very cautious before posting your name, address, telephone number, place of work or any other information that could identify you.
Information that you post in such areas can be seen by anyone and archived for use later on.
==========
When shopping online, be sure you are dealing with reputable businesses who handle transactions securely before giving out credit card numbers or other personal information.
Instruct your children never to give out information about themselves without first checking with you.
