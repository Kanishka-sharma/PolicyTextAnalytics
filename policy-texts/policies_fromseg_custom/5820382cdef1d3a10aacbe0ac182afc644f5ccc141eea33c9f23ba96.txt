What Personal Information Does UCAR Collect?
You can visit most UCAR Web sites  and access most of our services without identifying who you are, or revealing personal information such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address, that can be used to identify you.
However, some services may require registration.
When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional), as well as choose a user name and password.

In these situations, if you choose to withhold any personal information requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain services or parts of a specific Web site.
If you do provide personal information when signing up for a service or completing a survey, UCAR will process such information for specific and limited purposes which we inform you about when we ask you for information.
For example, we may collect and use personal data to provide you with services, to respond to a question, or to communicate with you for other purposes.
Except as described in Section 3 hereof, unless expressly described in an applicable privacy policy, UCAR will not distribute your information to third parties.

Sharing of Information.
From time to time, UCAR may share information with its sponsors, outside contractors, auditors, consultants, and others hired by UCAR to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities.
