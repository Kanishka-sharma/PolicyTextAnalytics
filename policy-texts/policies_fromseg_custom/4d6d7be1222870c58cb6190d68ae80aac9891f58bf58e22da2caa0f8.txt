X. EU Privacy Rights
Users based in the European Union have the following legal rights in respect of their information:

The right to require AAO to confirm whether or not their information is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which their information is to be stored, and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to their information;
The right to require AAO to rectify inaccurate information without undue delay;
The right to request the erasure of their information.
Subject to certain conditions, AAO may be required to erase the information in response to such request where:

the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected, such as where a user chooses to terminate his or her use of the Content;
where the processing of the information is based on the user’s consent (and the other circumstances described in the Legal Bases for Processing Your Information and How Your Information is Disclosed sections above no longer apply), if the user withdraws his or her consent; or
the user objects to the processing of his or her information and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.
Where AAO has disclosed the information of a European Union user to a third party and the user requests the erasure or rectification of the data, AAO will take all reasonable steps to inform the third party of such request.
The right to restrict AAO from processing their information in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that information is disputed or an objection has been raised (see below).
In such circumstances, AAO will only process that information with the express consent of the user, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest;
The right to receive their information from AAO in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
The right to object to the processing of their information by AAO where:

AAO has relied on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that information, in which case we will immediately stop processing the user’s information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the user; or
the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will immediately stop processing the user’s information for such purposes.
The right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority of the EU member state where the user resides.
The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment.
