Information Collection and Use







ClubSwim,
      operator of
      ClubSwim.com, is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.
We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.
We collect information from our users at several different points on our website.

Everyone is welcome to register.
During the registration process, you are required to
      submit personal information such as your first and last name, zip code, and email address.
We use your name and zip code to personalize your experience on the site.
We use your email address as your login name.
If you ever forget your password, we will send it to the email address that you registered under.

If you do not choose to receive emails from us, we will never send you anything.
Correction/Updating Personal
      Information







If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.
This can be done from the Account Overview page or by emailing the address given at the website.

Listing Your Services In Our Directory







We ask for more detailed information from users who choose to list their own services in our Directory.
However, we never supply other people with your contact information.
We use your contact information to notify you when people have expressed interest in your service.
To preserve your privacy, we email you the contact information of interest users so you can contact them yourself.
==========
Special Offers







We send all new members a welcoming email.
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, or a newsletter.
Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
You may opt out now or at a later date.
==========
Refer A Friend







If a user
      chooses to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s email address.
ClubSwim will automatically send a one-time email inviting the friend to visit the site.
Surveys
      And Contests







From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).
Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
==========
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

Cookies







Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive
      through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to customize your experience at
      ClubSwim.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
      your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when
      you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of
      ClubSwim's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
==========
Security







This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry -
      SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.
To learn more about
      SSL, follow this link 
http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html. 

      While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.
==========
Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.
When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.
Notification of Changes








    ClubSwim may amend this policy from time to time.
If we make any 
    substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will 
    notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.
