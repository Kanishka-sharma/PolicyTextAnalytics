RIM's processing of your personal information  a) Retention RIM retains personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of RIM's identified purposes or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable laws.
When personal information is no longer necessary or relevant for RIM's identified purposes, or required by applicable laws, RIM will take steps to have it deleted, destroyed, erased, aggregated or made anonymous.
Consistent with good business practice, RIM continues to evolve our controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to your personal information.
==========
b) International operations and onward transfers RIM has an international presence, with offices and facilities in multiple jurisdictions.
Except where a RIM subsidiary or affiliate has its own separate privacy policy, all of RIM's international operations and onward transfers are subject to this Privacy Policy.
You agree that, to be able to better serve you and facilitate the use or functioning of RIM Offerings, your personal information may be collected, used, processed, transferred or stored by or on behalf of RIM in multiple jurisdictions including Canada, the United States, the European Economic Area, Singapore and any other country where RIM or our service providers have offices or facilities, including countries which may be outside the region in which you are situated and may have different privacy or data protection legislation, and may therefore be subject to the laws of these countries.
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or a country which restricts data transfers outside of that jurisdiction or region without your consent, you consent to your personal information being transferred outside of the European Economic Area or your country for processing or storage by or on behalf of RIM.
==========
Given the international nature of our business, RIM may also be required to disclose or otherwise provide access to your communications data, including the contents of your communications, and other information under the laws of countries where RIM, our service providers, affiliates and data are located.
By using RIM Offerings, you consent to our compliance with applicable laws including any legal process that RIM believes requires that we produce or provide access to your communications data and other information.
c) Marketing communications from RIM RIM may communicate with you by a variety of means, such as using the email address(es) that you associate to your RIM device or your unique device identifier (e.g. PIN).
RIM may communicate information, surveys, marketing materials, advertisements or customized content which has been personalized to try to make it more relevant to you as part of your existing business relationship with RIM.
For example, we may do so where you have not unsubscribed from receiving such communications and it is permitted by law, where you have explicitly agreed to receive such communications, where you use free services which rely upon advertising (including targeted advertising based on profile information), or through utilizing aggregated data or data that has been made anonymous.
==========
RIM may ask you from time to time if you would like to receive from RIM or authorized third parties selected by RIM additional announcements, news, offers or event invitations regarding RIM and RIM Offerings.
You may also choose to provide RIM with information in response to various RIM promotions.
If you agree to participate in contests, surveys, giveaways, reviews, or other promotions that RIM sponsors or co-sponsors, please ensure that you read the Notice that may be associated with these initiatives in order to obtain further details about how your personal information will be managed.
==========
Typically, an unsubscribe mechanism is included with every RIM marketing or commercial communication.
Please visit the section below on "Managing your preferences" for more information on managing marketing or commercial communications from RIM.
d) Service-related communications from RIM RIM may also send you certain service-related communications.
For example, RIM may send a welcome email or message when you first register your device to inform you about the service and its terms, to notify you of important changes, to tell you how to manage your credentials or account, to provide service infrastructure notifications or information about upgrades or updates, to provide warranty information, product recall information, safety or security information, or for surveys of current or former users.
Because such service-related communications are important to your use of RIM Offerings, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.
==========
e) Information sharing In accordance with this Privacy Policy, RIM may share your personal information within RIM or with our service providers.
RIM may also share information with our financial, insurance, legal, accounting or other advisors that provide professional services to RIM.
RIM may also share information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy with third parties involved in providing RIM Offerings to you including airtime service providers, authorized resellers, distributors, merchants of record or payment processors, subcontractors or entities participating in RIM's supply or repair chains.
In certain situations where you purchase or use a Third Party Offering (e.g. paid content subscription service, downloaded application), RIM may share certain information with the third party for purposes of providing you with the product, service or software and your information will then be subject to the third party's privacy policy.
We encourage all our users to learn about the privacy practices of such third parties before agreeing to purchase or obtain their products, services or software.
==========
RIM uses contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being processed by our service providers.
It is RIM's policy to enter into confidentiality obligations with any third party that obtains confidential information including personal information from RIM.
For example, except where RIM is required or permitted by law to disclose personal information, our service providers to whom we provide your personal information typically agree to hold the information in confidence and only use the information for the purposes for which it was provided or to comply with applicable laws.
In the event of the sale of all or a portion of RIM's assets, RIM may provide personal information to the third party purchaser.
RIM may utilize third parties (e.g. advertising networks) to target advertisements at non-personally identifiable attributes or aggregated data that is derived from profile data processed by RIM, and provide such third parties with general statistics relating to the advertisements delivered.
Please visit the section below on "Managing your preferences" for more information on managing marketing or commercial communications from RIM.
==========
f) Third Party Offerings RIM does not own or operate all the applications or services that you download and use on your device or through other RIM Offerings.
When you download or utilize Third Party Offerings, personal information from your device or other RIM Offerings may be accessed by such third parties.
For example, a Third Party Offering might access on-device data such as contacts, calendar entries, email, location-based information, or it may access or share files or data stored on the device (including with additional Third Party Offerings).
==========
You should review the privacy policies and any agreements with such third parties to understand how your personal information will be treated by those entities, as RIM is not responsible for your dealings with third parties or their applications, products, services or software.
RIM does not directly control how such third parties process any personal information they collect in connection with the Third Party Offerings you use.
In some cases, you may adjust the permissions granted to Third Party Offerings.
You should periodically review these permissions including default permissions, as well as the Options or Settings menu on your device, in order to learn more about its security and available controls.
