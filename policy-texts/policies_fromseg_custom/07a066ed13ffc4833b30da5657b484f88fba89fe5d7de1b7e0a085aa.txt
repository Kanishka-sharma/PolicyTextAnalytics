Overview
PayPal has developed this Privacy Statement to explain how PayPal, as a Data Controller,  may collect, retain, process, share and transfer your Personal Data when you visit our Sites or use our Services.
This Privacy Statement applies to your Personal Data when you visit Sites or use Services, and does not apply to online websites or services that we do not own or control, including websites or services of other PayPal Users.
As a European bank registered in Luxembourg, we comply with data protection and financial regulatory requirements.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Statement does not constitute a “framework contract” for the purpose of the EU Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC) or any implementation of that Directive in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom.
This Privacy Statement is designed to help you obtain information about our privacy practices and to help you understand your privacy choices when you use our Sites and Services.
==========
Please note that our Service offerings may vary by region.
This Privacy Statement may be supplemented with additional notices depending on the Sites and Services concerned.
Supplementary information can be found in the Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies and the Banking Regulations Notice.
We have defined some terms that we use throughout the Privacy Statement.
You can find the meaning of a capitalised term in the Definitions section.
Please contact us if you have questions about our privacy practices that are not addressed in this Privacy Statement.

What Personal Data Do We Collect?
We collect Personal Data about you when you visit our Sites or use our Services, including the following:
Registration and use information – When you register to use our Services by establishing an Account, we will collect Personal Data as necessary to offer and fulfil the Services you request.
Depending on the Services you choose, we may require you to provide us with your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and identification information to establish an Account.
==========
We may require you to provide us with additional Personal Data as you use our Services.
Transaction and experience information – When you use our Services or access our Sites, for example, to make purchases from merchants, to receive money, to process payments, or to send money to friends and family, we collect information about the transaction, as well as other information associated with the transaction such as amount sent or requested, amount paid for products or services, merchant information, including information about any funding instruments used to complete the transaction, Device Information, Technical Usage Data, and Geolocation Information.
Participant Personal Data – When you use our Services or access our Sites, we collect Personal Data you provide us about the other participants associated with the transaction.
Send or request money:  When you send or request money through the Services, we collect Personal Data such as name, postal address, telephone number, and financial account information about the participant who is receiving money from you or sending money to you.
The extent of Personal Data required about a participant may vary depending on the Services you are using to send or request money.
==========
Pay or request someone else to pay a bill:  If you use our Services to pay a bill for the benefit of someone else, or if you request a User to pay a bill for you, we collect Personal Data from you about the account holder such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and account number of the bill that you intend to pay or request to be paid.
Add value to your accounts:  If you use our Services to add value to your Account or any other account you may have, or if you ask a User to add value to any of these accounts, we may collect Personal Data from you about the other party, or from the other party about you to facilitate the request.
For example, if you use our Services to reload a mobile phone, or to request value be added to your mobile account, we may collect Personal Data and other information including mobile account number from the other participant.
==========
Information about your public profile and your friends and contacts –  It may be easier for us to help you transact with your friends and contacts if you choose to connect your contact list information with your Account or if your Account profile is publicly available.
If you establish an account connection between your device or a social media platform and your Account, we will use your contact list information (such as name, address, email address) to improve your experience when you use the Services.
When your Account profile is public, other users can find your profile to send you money by searching for you by name, username, email, or mobile number on PayPal and confirm it’s you by viewing your photo.
You can make your Account profile private anytime in your PayPal.me settings.
==========
Personal data that you choose to provide us to obtain additional Services or specific online Services – If you request or participate in an optional Site feature, or request enhanced Services or other elective functionality, we may collect additional information from you.
We will provide you with a separate notice at the time of collection, if the use of that Personal Data differs from the uses disclosed in this Privacy Statement.
Personal Data about you if you use unbranded Services – certain Services are available without being required to log in to or establish an Account.
We will collect Personal Data when you are interacting with and making payments to merchants using our card payment services that do not carry the PayPal brand and when you checkout with PayPal without logging into an account.
For our unbranded payment services, your interaction is with the merchant, on their platform.
==========
If you are an Account holder, or create an Account at a later date, we may collect information about unbranded transactions and associate them with your Account to improve your customer experience as an Account holder and for compliance and analytics purposes.
If you are not an Account holder, we will collect and store all information you provide and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
Personal Data about you from third-party sources – We obtain information from third-party sources such as merchants, data providers, and credit bureaus, where permitted by law.
Other information we collect related to your use of our Sites or Services – We may collect additional information from or about you when you communicate with us, contact our customer support teams or respond to a survey.

==========
Why Do We Retain Personal Data?
We retain Personal Data in an identifiable format for the least amount of time necessary to fulfill our legal or regulatory obligations and for our business purposes.
We may retain Personal Data for longer periods than required by law if it is in our legitimate business interests and not prohibited by law.
If your Account is closed, we may take steps to mask Personal Data and other information, but we reserve our ability to retain and access the data for so long as required to comply with applicable laws.
==========
We will continue to use and disclose such Personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
The cookies we use have defined expiration times; unless you visit our Sites or use our Services within that time, the cookies are automatically disabled and retained data is deleted.

With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers: We may share information about you and your Account with the other parties involved in processing your transactions.

6.
==========
How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?
A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.
For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorise or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.
When you authorise such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.
Examples of account connections include:
linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;
connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or
using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.
==========
If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.
For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.
If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.
We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.
Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.
==========
Before authorising an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that you authorised to have an account connection that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.
For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.
7.
International transfers
Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers.
==========
The parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own and outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.
These countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection.
We have taken specific steps, in accordance with EEA and UK data protection law, to protect your Personal Data.
In particular, for transfers of your Personal Data within PayPal related companies, we rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent Supervisory Authorities (available here).
Other transfers may be based on contractual protections.
==========
Please contact us for more information about this.
If you make transactions with parties outside the EEA, UK or Switzerland or connect our Service with platforms, such as social media, outside the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we are required to transfer your Personal Data with those parties in order to provide the requested Service to you.

How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?
When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognise you as a User and to customise your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions and perform analytics; and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Sites and Services.
