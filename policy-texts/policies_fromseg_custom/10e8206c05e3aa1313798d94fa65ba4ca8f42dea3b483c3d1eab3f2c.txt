Protecting your privacy 


Protecting your privacy, along with your financial assets, is at the core of our business.
You have 
chosen to do business with us, and we recognize our obligation to keep the information you 
provide to us secure and confidential.
==========
Our commitment to protect your financial information will continue under the principles and 
online guidelines described below.
Keeping your information secure


Keeping your financial information secure is one of our most important responsibilities.
We 
value your trust and handle your information with care.
==========
Our employees access information about you when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs.
We may also access information about you when considering a request from you for additional services or when exercising our rights under the law or any agreement with you.
==========
We safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures, and we continually assess new technology for protecting information.
Our employees are trained to understand and comply with these information principles.
==========
Working to meet your needs through information


In the course of doing business, we collect and use various types of information, such as information available from public records, market research and credit reports, as well as information you provide to us.
We use this information to service your accounts and to help you learn more about the financial services you're interested in.
==========
Keeping information accurate


Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important.
If you ever find that your account information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please call or write to us at the telephone number or address listed on your account statement.
We will correct any erroneous information as quickly as possible.
==========
How - and why - information is shared


We limit who receives information and what type of information is shared.
We share information with the goal of bringing you greater convenience and more choices.
==========
Sharing information with Bank of America affiliates.
Bank of America is made up of a number of companies, such as our bank, brokerage company, credit card company, auto leasing company and more.
==========
All of these companies work together to provide the accounts and services you want.
By sharing information about your accounts and relationship among our family of companies, we can serve you more efficiently and make it easier for you to do business with us.
For example, if you have an account with one of our companies and want to open an account with another of our companies, we may share information you have provided to us.
This could save you time in opening your new account since you may not need to furnish the same information twice.
==========
We may also share information from your applications and external sources, such as credit reports, among the Bank of America family of companies in an effort to serve you.
We will not share information obtained from these sources or provided by you on applications unless we have given you prior notice.
==========
Sharing information with companies that work for us.
To assist us in offering you services, we may occasionally share information with companies that work for us, such as check-printing and data processing companies.
These companies might, for example, assist us in offering you certain products and services or help us mail account statements.
These companies act on our behalf and are obligated to keep the information that we provide to them confidential.
==========
Consolidation Sites.
Please use caution when using consolidation sites.
Consolidation sites are Internet sites which offer the ability to collect all of
your personal information on one site.
For example, you may be encouraged to
provide consolidation sites your personal finance information, such as your
Online ID, Access ID, PC Password or Online Passcode for Online Banking.
==========
NEVER
PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO A SITE THAT YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE AND FULLY
TRUST.
YOU SHOULD KNOW:  ALL transactions initiated by a consolidation site using
access information you provide are considered to be authorized by you, whether
or not you were aware of the specific transaction.
You may revoke this
authority only by notifying us, and we may need to block your account until we
issue new access codes.
==========
Bank of America is committed to making sure that your Online Banking is safe and
secure.
With our own security infrastructure in place, we are confident that
access to your accounts is private and secure; we are unable to provide similar
assurances for other websites.
While Bank of America works to protect your
banking privacy, you also play a role in protecting your accounts.
Only provide
your Access ID or Online ID when your browser shows a Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
connection directly to the Bank of America website or to another site you have
investigated and fully trust.
Other.
==========
Information may also be exchanged with credit bureaus and similar organizations,  provided when legally required or permitted, or in connection with a fraud investigation, an acquisition or the sale of your account to another financial institution.
If we receive a subpoena or similar legal process demanding release of any information about you, we will generally attempt to notify you (unless we believe we are prohibited from doing so).
==========
Except as required by law or as described above, we do not share information with other parties, including government agencies.
Certain information, such as trust and fiduciary information, is subject to very strict limitations regarding the sharing of information, both internally and externally.
==========
Bank of America does not share any customer information with third party marketers offering their products and services.
While we may continue to offer products and services from third party marketers, Bank of America and the companies that work for us will control the customer information used to make the offers.
==========
Offering you choices 


To make your financial life easier, we offer you different ways to manage your money.
You also have choices when it comes to learning about new offers and services.
==========
For example, you can choose not to receive notification about any offers made by mail, telephone or e-mail.
You can also choose not to have information from an application or an outside source, such as a credit report, shared within our family of companies.
==========
Whatever your preferences, we will honor your request.
(Please note that we will continue to share some account information among our family of companies as permitted by law.
We will do so for internal purposes or to provide more value and better service.)

Online Privacy Guidelines


Protecting information online


Whether you are a current customer or just visiting us online, we safeguard the information you provide to us at www.bankofamerica.com.
How we use and protect this information is described below.
Protecting online applications


When you apply online for accounts or services, or enroll in online banking, you provide personal information that is necessary for us to process your application.
==========
To ensure that your application remains confidential, the information is sent to us in a "secure session" established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
For further information about SSL, click here.
After you have submitted your application online, we recommend that you end your browser session before leaving your computer.
We, along with the outside companies with which we work, if applicable, may keep the information you provide to us, along with information we collect from outside sources, so that we can offer you accounts and services related to your financial needs.
How we handle e-mail


We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response so that we can more efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have.
We also do this to meet legal and regulatory requirements.
==========
If we think that a particular Bank of America account or service might apply to your situation, we may occasionally contact you at your e-mail address to inform you of potential benefits and availability.
Regular non-encrypted Internet e-mail is not secure.
In the instances where Bank of America Internet e-mail addresses are provided, these are provided for information inquiries of a non-sensitive and non-confidential nature.
==========
For secure online transmissions of information to us, you should use Bank of America Contact Us at www.bankofamerica.com.
Inquiries sent through our Contact Us pages are secure and use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.
Since an Internet e-mail response back to you would not be secure, we will not include
confidential account information in an e-mail response.
==========
You may also contact us by phone, U.S. mail or by visiting your nearest banking center.
See our Contact Us link and our Banking Center Locator Web pages for additional information about contacting us.
==========
What we do with online surveys


The information you provide on surveys and promotions on our web site will be used for internal marketing purposes, including developing web site information and services that you may find helpful.
In addition, we may inform you of new accounts and services from Bank of America based on the information you provide to us.
No data "capture" with planning tools


There are many planning tools throughout the site to help you make the financial decisions that are right for you in the privacy of your home.
We encourage you to try all of your "what-if" scenarios as often as you like.
==========
Examples include the mortgage principal and interest calculator and the savings goal calculators.
When you use various planning tools on our Web site, the calculations run on your PC or our server.
We do not capture the personal information you provide on these planning tools.
==========
Protecting your online banking


When you bank online with us, we, along with the outside companies we work with to bring these services to you, have access to your information.
Information is retained on our system or the system of the appropriate outside company, depending on what is required in order to serve you.
==========
We use state-of-the-art Internet technology, supported by the outside companies we work with, to make online banking secure and to protect your personal information.
For example, IBM provides advanced security technology through the IBM/IGN Global Network for Bank of America Online Banking Services.
==========
We also require an I.D. and password to access your accounts.
If you do not provide this information, we cannot establish an online banking service for you.
You can also help maintain the security of your banking information by not sharing your I.D. or password with anyone, by changing your password regularly, and by remembering to sign off.
==========
Protecting your privacy online


Whenever we ask for personal information on our web site, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL technology) for transferring data.
This technology encrypts - or scrambles - your account information so it's virtually impossible for anyone other than Bank of America to read it.

When information is collected and not collected


Some areas of our web site require information, such as your e-mail address or your account number, to enable you to perform certain tasks (for example, review your accounts or correspond with us).
In these cases, we collect your information if necessary to interact with you.
If you do not interact with us, you browse our web site anonymously, and personal information, such as your e-mail address, is not collected.
==========
We gather and analyze data regarding usage of our web site, including domain name, number of hits, pages visited, length of user session, etc., to evaluate the usefulness of our sites.
About "cookies"


To provide better service and a more effective web site, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser.
A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our web page server.
These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine who you are or your e-mail address.
Cookies are commonly used on web sites and do not harm your system.
==========
By configuring your preferences or options in your browser, you determine if and how a cookie will be accepted.
We use cookies to determine if you have previously visited our web site and for a number of administrative purposes.
==========
Protecting our children


We do not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children.
We recognize that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.
==========
Count on our commitment to your privacy


You can count on us to keep you informed about how we protect your privacy and limit the sharing of information you provide to us - whether it's at a banking center, over the phone or through the Internet.
Please note that since we cannot control information on other Internet sites, we are not responsible for the content of sites linked from www.bankofamerica.com.
