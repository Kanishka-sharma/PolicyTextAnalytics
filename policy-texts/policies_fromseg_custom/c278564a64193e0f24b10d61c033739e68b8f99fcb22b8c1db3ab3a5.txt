Children's Privacy
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) gives parents control over what information websites can collect from their kids.
The COPPA Rule puts additional protections in place and streamlines other procedures that companies covered by the rule need to follow.
The COPPA FAQs can help keep your company COPPA compliant.
Learn about the COPPA Safe Harbor Program and about organizations the FTC has approved to implement safe harbor programs.
You can also get information about ways to get verifiable parental consent– including new methods the Commission has approved – and the process for seeking approval for new methods.

Health Privacy
Consumers care about the privacy and security of their health-related information.
If your company makes privacy promises – either expressly or by implication – the FTC Act requires you to live up to those claims.
==========
In addition, even if you don’t make specific claims, you still have an obligation to maintain security that's appropriate in light of the nature of the data you possess.
Also, if you experience a data breach, the Health Breach Notification Rule may apply to your business.
Companies covered by the Rule must take specific steps following a breach.

Think again — and reread your privacy policy to make sure you're honoring the promises you've pledged.
==========
Consumers care about the privacy of their personal information and savvy businesses understand the importance of being clear about what you do with their data.
Credit Reporting
Does your business use consumer reports or credit reports to evaluate customers’ creditworthiness?
Do you consult reports when evaluating applications for jobs, leases, or insurance?
Here's information about your responsibilities under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other laws when using, reporting, and disposing of information in those reports.

Data Security
Many companies keep sensitive personal information about customers or employees in their files or on their network.
Having a sound security plan in place to collect only what you need, keep it safe, and dispose of it securely can help you meet your legal obligations to protect that sensitive data.
The FTC has free resources for businesses of any size.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions – companies that offer consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance – to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.

Red Flags Rule
Are you up on the Red Flags Rule?
(Sometimes it’s referred to as one of the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s Identity Theft Rules and it appears in the Code of Federal Regulations as “Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation of Identity Theft.”)
The Red Flags Rule requires many businesses and organizations to implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program designed to detect the warning signs – or red flags – of identity theft in their day-to-day operations.

Privacy Shield
Update on the Privacy Shield Framework: On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment declaring invalid the European Commission’s Decision 2016/1250/EC of July 12, 2016 on the adequacy of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
We continue to expect companies to comply with their ongoing obligations with respect to transfers made under the Privacy Shield Framework.
