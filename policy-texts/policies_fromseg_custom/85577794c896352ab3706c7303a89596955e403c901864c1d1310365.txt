Roku values the privacy of our users.
This Privacy Policy describes the information that Roku, Inc. and affiliated companies other than Roku DX Holdings, Inc. (“Roku,” “we,” or “us”) collect about consumers (“you” and “your household”) and how we use and share that information.
==========
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Roku on the “Roku Services”, which includes: Roku websites (“Roku Sites”), Roku’s products and certain other products utilizing Roku’s streaming platform or operating systems (including Roku players, Roku TVs, speakers and other audio-enabled products) (collectively, “Roku Devices”), certain Roku co-branded channels (“Roku Direct Publisher Channels”), Roku’s mobile apps (including the Roku Mobile App), Roku branded channels like the Roku Media Player and The Roku Channel (“Roku’s Channels”), the Roku emails and newsletters, and Roku’s accounts on third-party social networking sites.
Using our products and services, you can stream channels provided by other companies (“Third-Party Channels”), and Roku co-branded channels like the Roku Direct Publisher Channels.
When you stream one of these channels, you are interacting with that channel directly, and the channel provider and its analytics and advertising partners may collect information from your Roku Device, including your device identifier and how you use that channel.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the actions of these channel providers and their partners.
For more information about how these channels use your data, please see their privacy policies.

We receive information about your activities within Roku’s Channels and Roku Direct Publisher Channels (i.e., channels co-branded with the Roku logo on the channel’s home page), like the videos and other content you select and view within these channels.
If you use the Roku Media Player channel to view your video or photo files or listen to your music files, Roku will collect data about the files viewed within the Roku Media Player, such as codecs, and other metadata of the local files you play through the Roku Media Player.
When you use a Roku TV with the Smart TV experience enabled, we use Automatic Content Recognition (“ACR”) technology to receive information about what live television content you watch via the Roku TV’s antenna, and what you watch via devices connected to your Roku TV, including cable and satellite set top boxes.
==========
For example, we receive TV viewing information such as the programs, commercials, and channels you view, the date, time and duration of the viewing, and how you use the on-screen TV guide.
We receive TV viewing information both when you access live TV directly through your Smart TV’s interface and when you access live TV from within a Third-Party Channel.
If the Smart TV experience is enabled on your Roku TV, we will use this information to personalize your TV viewing experience and advertisements.
If you use Roku’s mobile apps, in addition to the other usage information described in this section, we also log whether you use a feature called Play on Roku, which allows you to play videos, photos and music stored on your mobile device on your Roku TV or a TV with a Roku streaming player connected to it.
