T-Mobile USA, Inc. ("T-Mobile") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the personal information we may collect about you, how we may use it, when we may disclose it, how we safeguard it, and how you may access it and control its use in connection with our marketing communications.
The policy also provides other important privacy information and describes when and how we may change this policy and how to contact us with any questions or comments.
We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure while it is under our control.
For instance, when you provide sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) to our Web sites, we use transmission encryption technologies like Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
Although we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information will not occur, we strive to prevent such occurrences.
==========
Our practices and procedures are designed to limit personal information access to those T-Mobile employees and agents with a legitimate need to access such information.
T-Mobile employees are bound by confidentiality obligations and our Code of Conduct, which obligate them to protect the confidentiality of our customers’ personal information.
Violations subject employees to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
==========
We retain personal information for as long as we have a business need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require.
When we dispose of personal information, we use reasonable procedures to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).
We will make reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine that a security breach involving your personal information has occurred and creates a risk of identity theft or service disruption, or as otherwise required by law.
==========
Not all marketing communications you receive on your device are sent or authorized by T-Mobile.
When you provide your mobile number or other contact information to others, you may receive unwanted calls, text messages, or e-mails on your device.
We take steps to reduce unsolicited advertising, but we cannot block all such advertisements or unwanted communications.
==========
Caller ID Blocking  top

           When you use T-Mobile communications services, your name and telephone number may be transmitted and displayed on the receiving party’s communications device and/or phone bill unless you block that information, which you can generally do by dialing *67 prior to dialing the called party’s number.
Refer to the specific instructions for your communication device regarding Caller ID Blocking.
Caller ID Blocking does not prevent the display of your information when you dial certain business numbers, including 911, 900 numbers, or toll-free numbers.
==========
Children  top

           We do not solicit children to purchase our services or products.
If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your T-Mobile account, any personal information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy.
Our Web sites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect personal information on our sites from anyone under the age of 13.
We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.
We may offer Web Guard or similar security features designed to allow the customer to implement restrictions to adult orientated content, but such features are not foolproof.
==========
Consumer Code for Wireless Service  top

           We follow the Consumer Code for Wireless Service established by the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (“CTIA”).
As such, we strive to help customers understand their bills, receive quality service, and make informed choices.
In particular, as part of the Consumer Code, we conform our information practices under this policy to meet the requirements of applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
==========
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies  top

           We may use cookies (small data text files placed on your computer or device) or similar technologies to identify the computer or device and record your preferences and other data so that our Web sites can personalize your visit(s).
We may also use information collected from cookies to improve our sites, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request.
You may be able to set your browser(s) to reject cookies or delete cookies, but that may result in the loss of some functionality on our sites.
==========
We may also use Web beacons (small graphic images on a Web page or an HTML e-mail) to monitor interaction with our Web sites or e-mails.
Web beacons are generally invisible because they are very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page or e-mail message.
If we combine or link cookie or Web beacon information with personal information, we will treat the combined or linked information as personal information under this policy.
We may employ third-parties to place advertisements about our products and services on other Web sites.
The use of cookies, Web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-parties is subject to their privacy policies – not this policy.
==========
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)  top

           Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI", is a form of personal information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you.
CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features.
CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number.
==========
Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules.
We won’t intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your permission, except as allowed under FCC rules, applicable law, or explained in this policy.
However, you may designate other “authorized users” (for example, a spouse) to access and manage your account information, including CPNI.
We provide password protected online access to your account information through my.t-mobile.
com.
==========
For multi-line accounts, the primary account holder is authorized to access online account information for all the devices on the account.
Other users may generally access online account information related only to their respective device (for example, if a parent provides a device to their child, the child may access online information about that device – including CPNI).
The primary account holder, however, may designate additional or more limited access rights for other users.
==========
Customer Service Monitoring  top

           We may monitor and record phone calls, e-mails, or other communications between you and our Customer Service representatives or other employees for training and quality assurance purposes and to review specific transaction requests.
Directories  top

           We do not publish directories of our customers’ wireless numbers.
Nor will we provide or make such numbers available to third-parties for listing in their public directories, without the customer’s prior consent.
==========
Forums and Chat Rooms  top

           If you use or link to a public forum, bulletin board, chat room, or social network on or from a T-Mobile Web site, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for access to or use of personal information you choose to submit or share with others.
Location-Based Services  top

           Our network detects your device's approximate location whenever it is turned on (subject to coverage limitations).
This location technology makes the routing of wireless communications possible and is also the basis for providing enhanced emergency 9-1-1 service, which permits us to provide your general location to a public safety answering point, emergency medical service provider, or emergency dispatch provider.
We may also use this technology to disclose, without a user’s consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm.
With your consent, we may also provide location-based services or provide third-parties access to approximate location information so they may provide such services to you.
==========
You should carefully review the specific T-Mobile terms and conditions applicable to your use of location-based services for any special privacy implications or rules.
You should also carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of third-parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people.
Where a wireless device user requests that their location information be revealed to other persons (through a T-Mobile application or a third-party application you place on your device), the wireless device user will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared (except in the case of certain parental controls or similar services associated with enterprise or multi-line accounts, which may be managed solely by the primary account holder or their designee).
T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services
          
          
           Network Information Storage  top

           Some devices may automatically upload to T-Mobile network servers information you have stored on the device and/or SIM card in order to facilitate specific functions.
==========
For instance, some devices back-up your address book.
You may choose to disable such uploads but this may affect functionality of the device or your services.
Refer to instructions for your device and service for details or contact Customer Service for more information.
We may also provide you the ability to upload other information from your device to T-Mobile network servers.
For instance, you may have the option to upload pictures, recordings, calendars, tasks, or notes.
==========
Uploaded information will not be used by T-Mobile for purposes other than as disclosed in connection with those services, this Privacy Policy, or applicable Terms and Conditions, and will not be shared with third-parties for their use, without your prior consent.
Services and functionality offered through certain devices are provided in conjunction with other entities.
As a result, personal information from your devices may be uploaded and stored on their servers.
For instance, T-Mobile Sidekick® services are provided in conjunction with Danger, Inc., and personal information from your device is stored on the Danger® servers.
Similarly, BlackBerry® service is provided in conjunction with Research in Motion (RIM), and personal information from your device is stored on the BlackBerry Enterprise ServersTM.
==========
Their specific terms and conditions, terms of use, and privacy polices apply to those services.
Other Governing Terms  top

           This policy does not modify or alter any applicable agreement you have with T-Mobile.
For example, our Terms of Use govern your use of our Web sites.
Additionally, if you use our products or use or subscribe to our services, our T-Mobile Terms and Conditions, one or more applicable service agreements, and certain other terms may apply to your use, purchase, or subscription.
If this policy conflicts with any portion of those terms and agreements, those terms and agreements govern to the extent of the inconsistency.
==========
Protecting Your Own Personal Information  top

           You play an important role in ensuring the security of personal information, including protecting against unauthorized access to your device.
Many devices store information both in the phone and on the SIM card.
Therefore, before discarding, trading in, or giving away your device, be sure you remove and retain your SIM card and follow the manufacturer's instructions for deleting personal information or other data on the device.
(This can be found in your owner's manual or on the manufacturer’s Web site.)
If you provide a third-party access to your device, you should understand that personal information will remain on the device and may be accessible, deleted, altered, or transferred to another device or our network servers by the person using the device, and that we will treat that user as you for purposes of this policy.
==========
We encourage you to use passwords to prevent unauthorized access to your device, your online account, and your voicemail.
You may also establish an optional password to identify yourself during calls with our Customer Service representatives.
We recommend that you use unique, non-obvious passwords, that you periodically change your passwords, and that you not share your passwords with others.
==========
Notify us immediately if you believe your device has been lost or stolen or if you believe your personal information has been accessed without your consent.
Third-Party Applications for Your Devices  top

           When you install third-party applications (for example, programs, widgets, etc.) on your device, you may give your consent for the third party to access certain information you have stored on your device (for example your contact list).
You may also give your consent for the third party to access information stored on T-Mobile’s network to facilitate the application’s functions (for example, you may consent to third-party access to your location information – see Location Based Services).
In either case, the manner in which such third-parties may use, share, or disclose such information is governed by their terms and conditions and their privacy policy – not this policy.
Wireless Communications Security  top

           We cannot guarantee that your communications using our services or devices will be private or secure.
Although it is illegal for unauthorized persons to intercept or access your communications or information, such interceptions or access can occur.
