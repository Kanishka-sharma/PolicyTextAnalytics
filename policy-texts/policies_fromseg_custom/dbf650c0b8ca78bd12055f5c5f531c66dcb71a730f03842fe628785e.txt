The Open Source Development Network, Inc. ("OSDN"),
         comprised of the Internet sites osdn.com, slashdot.org,

com,
         newsforge.com, geocrawler.com and devchannel.com (the "OSDN
         Sites"), is committed to protecting the privacy of users of the
         OSDN Sites.
At OSDN, we intend to give you as much control as possible
         over your personal information, including registration data.
As part
         of the normal operation of the OSDN Sites, we collect information from
         you.
This Privacy Statement describes the information we collect about
         you and how that information may be used.
Information Gathered through the OSDN Sites:


         OSDN will track the domains from which people visit the OSDN Sites in
         order to gain aggregate data that may be analyzed for trends and
         statistics.
Subject to the provisions of this Privacy Statement, OSDN
         may use accumulated aggregate data for several purposes including, but
         not limited to, marketing analysis, evaluation of OSDN's
         services, and business planning.
==========
Currently, OSDN uses personal information as a basis for notifications
         to users, and in order to implement the Terms and Conditions of Use
         governing the OSDN Sites (the "Terms").
Generally, the user
         names, email addresses, and any additional information that a user may
         choose to post are publicly available on the OSDN Sites.
When
         users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information that may
         contain Registration Data, as defined in the Terms, or otherwise post
         personal information in conjunction with content subject to a license,
         such personal information necessarily will be disclosed subject to the
         terms of the applicable license.
An example of such a disclosure
         includes, but is not limited to, a user's disclosure of personal
         information as part of a message posted to a public message forum, or
         a publicly-released software application.
==========
OSDN may conduct surveys or other studies of its user base and usage
         for marketing and planning purposes.
Participation in such surveys is
         at the user's option, but OSDN does reserve the right to conduct
         mandatory surveys in the future.
With respect to information collected
         from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to
         be publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take
         the survey and OSDN will disclose only aggregate information regarding
         its users and not personal information identifying any specific
         individual.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys
         allow users to submit written comments, and where OSDN advises users
         of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the
         survey, OSDN reserves the right to disclose text information provided
         by any user through such a survey, provided that no personal
         information identifying that user is disclosed.
Circumstances
         under which OSDN would publicly disclose aggregate information
         include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site
         population, providing data to OSDN advertisers on user preferences
         and/or demographics, business planning, and publicizing overall usage
         data in press communications.
Cookies: OSDN employs "cookies" to provide users with
         tailored information.
A "cookie" is an element of data that
         a website, when visited by a user, sends to that user's browser
         which, in turn, may store that element on the user's hard drive or
         memory.
OSDN uses cookies to better serve users of our OSDN
         Sites; any cookies sent by OSDN will be marked so that they will be
         accessible only by OSDN Sites subject to this Privacy Statement.
However, at his or her option and at his or her sole expense and
         responsibility, any user may block or delete our cookies from his or
         her hard drive.
However, by disabling cookies, certain site features
         and functionality may no longer work properly, or at all.
==========
Other Notification: In order to implement or enforce the Terms,
         OSDN may use user-provided e-mail addresses to contact users on an
         individual basis.
At no time, unless such disclosure is required
         by law, a governmental agency, or specifically authorized by the user,
         will OSDN disclose individual user personal information to unrelated
         third parties that is not publicly available.
Links with other sites


         The OSDN Sites contain links to other websites, whether owned or
         controlled by OSDN affiliates, or unrelated third parties.
Please note
         that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from those of the
         OSDN Sites.
OSDN is not responsible for the privacy policies and
         practices of any linked website.
We encourage you to read the privacy
         statement of any website you may visit.
==========
Choice


"Opt-in" Emails: Users may "opt-in" to
         receive site notifications, newsletters, or other information via
         email.
Users may remove themselves from such services at their
         discretion.
Any email sent to an "opt-in" list will include
         directions for how a user may remove himself or herself from the list,
         or a URL where the user may find such directions.
==========
Profile Display: In some cases, users' personal information
         may be publicly available through a user's profile display.
In
         such cases, users have the option to opt out of publicly displaying
         their personal information, including e-mail addresses.
Users
         may also enlist this technique when posing comments on certain OSDN
         Sites.
In cases where site profiles allow users to display
         optional information publicly, such entry and display is at the
         user's discretion and may be changed at any time by the user.
Email Display: In some cases, users may have the opportunity to
         use an OSDN Site to send electronic mail to another user or email
         list.
In such cases, a user's valid email address and real name
         will be included with such messages.
==========
In order to prevent abuse, users
         may not opt-out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from
         using such OSDN Site to transmit an email message.
Access


         On certain OSDN Sites, users can view their data on their personal
         profile page.
When technically feasible, users are permitted to update
         their personal information directly through OSDN.
When such updating
         service is not technically feasible, OSDN will make reasonable efforts
         to assist users in updating their personal information.
Security


         To secure site integrity, OSDN employs measures, including but not
         limited to security audits, use of encryption tools and software, and
         other reasonable security measures and procedures.
Internal access to users' private and nonpublic personal
         information is restricted to site administrators and individuals on a
         need-to-know basis.
==========
Enforcement


         In the event that OSDN becomes aware that site security is compromised
         or nonpublic user information has been disclosed to unrelated third
         parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to
         external security attacks, OSDN shall take reasonable measures which
         it deems appropriate, including but not limited to internal
         investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with
         law enforcement authorities, notwithstanding other provisions of this
         Privacy Statement.
If OSDN becomes aware that a user's personal information provided
         to OSDN has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this
         Privacy Statement, OSDN shall make reasonable efforts to notify the
         affected user, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law,
         of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that OSDN knows
         this information.
Updates to the Privacy Statement


         To update the Privacy Statement, we will post both the changed version
         and its effective date at http://osdn.com/privacy.shtml.
==========
No Guarantees For Factors Beyond OSDN's Control


While this Privacy Statement expresses OSDN's standards for
         maintenance of private data, it is not in a position to guarantee that
         the standards will always be met.
There may be factors beyond
         OSDN's control (e.g., "script kiddies", "crackers and other malcontents") that may result in
         disclosure of data.
As a consequence, OSDN disclaims any warranties or
         representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private
         information.
