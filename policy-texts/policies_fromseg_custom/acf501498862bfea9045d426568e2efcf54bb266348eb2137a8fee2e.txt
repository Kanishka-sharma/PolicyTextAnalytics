  otherwise described in this Policy.
==========
Location Information.
When you use the
  Platform, we may collect general location information (such as IP address).
If you
  install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's
  geolocation data.
If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your
  precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including
  providing you with location-based features (e.g. for identification of Pro Services
  available near you).
To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your
  location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers.
If you access the
  Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with
  location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking
  functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.
See your device
  manufacturer's instructions for further details.
If you
  disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the
  Platform.
==========
Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.
We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags,
  and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize
  preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform.
These
  technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your
  password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage
  content, and compile statistics about Platform usage.
We also use certain of these
  technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you.
We
  or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in
  emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails
  are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
==========
We may also use local shared objects (also known as "Flash
  cookies") to assist in delivering special content, such as video clips or animation.
Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web
  browser.
To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe
  website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.
==========
You can choose to accept or decline cookies.
Most web browsers
  automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser
  settings to decline cookies if you prefer.
If you disable cookies, you may be prevented
  from taking full advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly.
Flash
  cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available
  in a web browser may not affect flash cookies.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such
  as those of Google Analytics.
These service providers use the sort of technology
  described in the Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above
  to help us analyze how users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party
  website from which you arrive.
The information collected by the technology will be
  disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information
  to evaluate your use of the Platform.
We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes
  related to advertising, as described in the following section.
To prevent Google
  Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the
  
          Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.
==========
Tailored Advertising
Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed
  via the Platform may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your
  computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of
  the Platform in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on
  past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content
  impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing
  impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites.
We also allow
  other third parties(e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google
  Analytics, DoubleClick, Facebook and others) to serve tailored marketing
  to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer,
  mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform.
We neither have access
  to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that
  may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the
  Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any
  other non-affiliated third parties.
==========
Those parties that use these technologies may offer
  you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below.
You may receive
  tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.
Cookies may be associated
  with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted
  to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed,
  non-human readable form.
If you are interested in more information about tailored browser
  advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer
  to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the 
            Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
            Linkand/or the 
            Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Linkto
  opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
  programs.
To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google
  Display Network ads, you can visit the 
            Google Ads Settings page.
Please note that to the extent advertising
  technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content
  even if you opt out of tailored advertising.
In that case, the advertising content will
  just not be tailored to your interests.
==========
Also, we do not control any of the above
  opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms
  or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
If your browsers are
  configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently
  erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers,
  yourNAI or DAAopt-out may no longer be effective.
Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above
  links.
==========
When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored
  in-application advertising content.
Each operating system, iOS for Apple devices,
  Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own
  instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing
  content.
You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the
  respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application
  advertising.
For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy
  settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform
  operator.
CALIFORNIA DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURE
Thumbtack is committed to providing you with meaningful choices
  about the information collected on our Platform for third party purposes.
That is why
  we have provided links below to the NAI "Customer Opt-out" link, DAA opt-out link, a
  Google opt-out link.
However, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
  browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the internet industry is currently still
  working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.

  18 years of age or older may use the Platform.

SECURITY
We employ appropriate physical, procedural and technological
  security measures, which are reasonably designed to help protect your personal
  information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
Thumbtack may
  use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to
  help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure.
No
  security measures, however, are 100% failsafe.
Therefore, we do not promise and cannot
  guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private
  communications will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others.
==========
You should take
  steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by,
  among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust
  password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password
  private, and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts.

  responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen,
  compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password
  activity.
LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS
The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over
  which Thumbtack does not have any control.
Such links do not constitute an endorsement
  by Thumbtack of those external websites.
You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing
  these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not
  responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of
  information you provide while visiting such external websites.

  our sole discretion.

  you for retaining information related to your Account.

Disabling Cookies.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies.
Most web browsers
   automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to
   decline cookies if you prefer.
If you disable cookies you may be prevented from
   taking full advantage of the Platform because it may not function properly.
Flash
   LSOs operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available
   in a web browser will not remove flash cookies.
To learn more about how to manage
   flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global
   Privacy Settings Panel.

Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a
   unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are
   stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web
   pages.
We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in
   connection with our Platform to, among other things, track the activities of
   Platform visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform
   usage.
We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails
   to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails
   are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
California Do Not Track Disclosure.
Thumbtack is committed to providing you with
   meaningful choices about the information collected on our Platform for third party
   purposes.
==========
That is why we have provided links below to the NAI "Customer Opt-out"
   link, DAA opt-out link, a Google opt-out link.
However, Thumbtack does not control
   any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make
   using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these
   mechanisms.
Further, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
   browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still
   working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.

How Thumbtack Uses the Information We Collect
1.
HOW PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED
We collect your personal information and aggregate information about the use of our
   Platform and Services to better understand your needs and to provide you with a
   better Platform experience.
Specifically, we may use your personal information for
   any of the following reasons:

To provide our Services to you, including registering you for our Services,
        verifying your identity and authority to use our Services, and to otherwise
        enable you to use our Platform and our Services;
For customer support and to respond to your inquiries;
For internal record-keeping purposes;
To process billing and payment, including sharing with PayPal or other third
        party payment gateways in connection with Platform and/or Thumbtack's products
        and Services;
To improve and maintain our Platform and our Services (for example, we track
        information entered through the "Search" function; this helps us determine
        which areas of our Platform users like best and areas that we may want to
        enhance; we also will use for trouble-shooting purposes, where applicable);
To periodically send promotional emails, which you may unsubscribe from at any
        time, to the email address you provide regarding new products from Thumbtack,
        special offers from Thumbtack or other information about Thumbtack that we
        think you may find interesting;
To contact you via email, telephone, facsimile or mail, or, where requested, by
        text message, to deliver certain services or information you have
        requested;
For Thumbtack's market research purposes, including, but not limited to, the
        customization of the Platform according to your interests;
We may use your demographic information (i.e., age, postal code, residential
        and commercial addresses, and other various data) to more effectively
        facilitate the promotion of goods and services to appropriate target audiences
        and for other research and analytical purposes;
To resolve disputes, to protect ourselves and other users of our Platform and
        Services, and to enforce our Terms of Use;
We also may compare personal information collected through the Platform and
        Services to verify its accuracy with personal information collected from third
        parties; and
We may combine aggregate data with the personal information we collect about
        you.
C. Electronic Newsletters, Invitations, Polls and Surveys
At our sole discretion, Thumbtack may offer any of the following free services on
   the Platform, which you may select to use or receive at your option.
Certain of the
   following services may require you to provide additional personal information as
   detailed below:
1.
==========
ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS
We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users.
We will gather the email
   addresses of users who sign up for Thumbtack for the newsletter mailing list.
Users
   may remove themselves from this mailing list by opting out of receiving newsletters
   during the registration process, by following the link provided in each newsletter
   that points users to a subscription management page where the user can unsubscribe
   from receiving newsletters, or by changing their preferences in their Profile
   Settings page.
2.
==========
"SEND TO A FRIEND"
Our Platform users can voluntarily choose to electronically forward a link, page, or
   document to someone else by clicking "send to a friend."
To do so, the user must
   provide his or her email address, as well as the email address of the recipient.
The user's email address is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of
   course, to let the recipient know who sent the email.
The information is not used
   for any other purpose.
3.
==========
POLLING
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with
   other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues, Services,
   and/or the Platform.
Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not
   identifiable to any particular user.
We may use a system to "tag" users after they
   have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question.
This tag is not
   correlated with information about individual users.
4.
==========
SURVEYS
We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better target our content to our
   Platform users.
We will not share individual responses from these surveys with any
   third party apart from the survey provider.
We will share aggregate data with third
   party service providers, partners, and other third parties.
We also will post
   aggregate data containing survey responses on our Platform; that data may be viewed
   and downloaded by other users of our Platform.
==========
D. Children's Privacy
Our Services are not designed for children under 18.
Thumbtack requires that only
   persons 18 years of age or older use the Platform and/or the Services.
By using the
   Platform and/or the Services, you hereby represent that you are at least 18 years
   old.
If we discover that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information,
   we will delete such information from our systems.
==========
E. Security
We employ appropriate physical, procedural and technological security measures,
   which are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from
   unauthorized access or disclosure.
Thumbtack may use encryption, passwords, and
   physical security measures to help protect your personal information against
   unauthorized access and disclosure.
No security measures, however, are 100%
   complete.
==========
Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not
   expect, that your personal information or private communications will not be
   collected and used by others.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized
   access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off
   after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or
   can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.
Thumbtack is not
   responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen,
   compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password
   activity.
==========
F. Disclosure
We may share the information that we collect about you, including your personal
   information, as follows:
1.
INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO PROTECT US AND OTHERS
We may disclose your personal information to prevent an emergency, protect or
   enforce our rights, enforce our Terms of Use and/or to protect the safety of users
   of our Platform and our Services or protect or enforce the rights of a third party,
   or as required by law.
2.
==========
INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS
We may contract with various third parties for the provision and maintenance of the
   Platform, Services and our business operations, and Thumbtack may need to share your
   personal information and data generated by cookies and aggregate information
   (collectively, "information") with these vendors and service agencies.
For example,
   we may provide your information to a credit card processing company to process your
   payment.
The vendors and service agencies are only permitted to use your personal
   information as necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you.
If you complete a survey, we also may share your information with the survey
   provider; if we offer a survey in conjunction with another entity, we also will
   disclose the results to that entity.
3.
==========
DISCLOSURE TO NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES IN FURTHERANCE OF YOUR REQUEST
Your request for services may be shared with third party websites with whom we have
   a contractual relationship in order to provide your request with maximum exposure.
The post on the third party website will include the details of your request,
   including your location, but will not include your last name.
Interested bidders,
   however, will be able to click on your request on such third party site, and will
   be directed to our Platform where they will have access to your first name and the
   first letter of your last name, as would any other service provider on our Platform
   interested in bidding on your request.
4.
==========
DISCLOSURE TO OTHER USERS OF OUR PLATFORM
If you are a service professional, the information that you post (other than your
   payment information) is available to other users of our Platform and our Services.
Comments that users post to our Platform also will be available to other visitors to
   our Platform (see our discussion of User Generated Content below).
In addition, we
   will post the results (in aggregate form) of surveys to our Platform.
If you are a
   consumer, your first name plus first initial of your last name, zip code, as well as
   the details of your request, are available to all visitors to our Platform.
Bidding
   professionals also will be permitted to see the consumer's full name and telephone
   number.
5.
INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
We will disclose your information, including, without limitation, your name, city,
   state, telephone number, email address, user ID history, quoting and listing
   history, and fraud complaints, to law enforcement or other government officials if
   we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or
   otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority.
6.
==========
IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR BANKRUPTCY
In the event that Thumbtack undergoes a change in control, including, without
   limitation, a merger or sale of all or substantially all of Thumbtack's assets to
   which this Platform relates or other corporate reorganization in which Thumbtack
   participates, and is thus merged with or acquired by a third party entity
   (a "Successor"), Thumbtack hereby reserves the right to transfer the information
   we have collected from the users of the Platform and/or Services to such
   Successor.
In addition, in the event of Thumbtack's bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership,
   or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application or laws or equitable
   principles affecting creditors' rights generally, Thumbtack may not be able to
   control how your information is transferred, used, or treated and reserves the right
   to transfer the information we have collected from the users of the Platform and/or
   Services to non-affiliated third parties in such event.
7.
==========
INFORMATION DISCLOSED AT YOUR REQUEST
We may share your personal information with other Registered Users to whom you
   explicitly ask us to send your information or if you explicitly consent to such
   disclosure upon receipt of a specific Service.
For instance, when you contract for a
   specific Service with another Registered User, Thumbtack will send that Registered
   User a notice that includes the personal information that you have chosen to allow
   Thumbtack to reveal to users with whom you contract.
8.
==========
AGGREGATE OR DE-IDENTIFIED DATA
Thumbtack may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected by the Platform and
   Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you.
Our use
   and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information is not subject to any
   restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without
   limitation for any purpose.
G. Links to External Platforms
The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Thumbtack
   does not have any control.
Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Thumbtack
   of those external websites.
You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing these links
   to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not responsible
   for the content of such external websites.
We are not responsible for the protection
   and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such external
   websites and such sites are not governed by this Policy.
Your use of any external
   website is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy located on the linked to
   such external website.
==========
H. Updating, Deleting and Correcting Your Personal Information
You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the
   following ways:
You can review, correct and delete your personal information by logging into the
   Platform and navigating to your preferences page in "Your Dashboard."
You must
   promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.
Typically,
   we will not manually alter your personal information because it is very difficult to
   verify your identity remotely.
Nonetheless, upon your request we will close your
   Account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably
   possible, based on your Account activity and in accordance with applicable law.
We
   do retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent
   fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with
   any investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any
   other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole and
   absolute discretion.
==========
You should understand, however, that once you publicly post a
   Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Platform, you may
   not be able to change or remove it.
Once we have deleted or removed your Account,
   you agree that Thumbtack shall not be responsible for any personal information that
   was not included within your deleted and/or removed Account that remains on the
   Platform.
I.
==========
What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?
We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you.
You may opt-out of
   such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email.
Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out
   requests.
If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other
   information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your
   Account or any Services you have requested or received from us.
==========
J. Third-Party Ad Networks
We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements on other
   websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites.
This enables us
   and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and
   services in which you might be interested.
Third party ad network providers,
   advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies,
   JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to
   measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to
   you.
These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third
   party's specific privacy policy, not this one.
We may provide these third-party
   advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well
   as aggregate or de-identified information about visitors to our Site and users of
   our service.
==========
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members
   of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance
   ("DAA").
For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA
   members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies,
   including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members,
   please visit their respective websites:
   www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp
   (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).
To opt out of Google Analytics for
   Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the
   Google Ads Settings page.
Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be
   the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or
   ads to you.
It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads
   on our Site or other websites.
You may continue to receive advertisements, for
   example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.
==========
Also, if your
   browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you
   subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers,
   your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.
Additional information is
   available on NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above links.
K. Your Full Name and Use of Thumbtack Information
1.
==========
YOUR FULL NAME
As a Registered User of the Platform you will select a Full Name during the
   registration process.
All of your activities on the Platform will be traceable to
   your Full Name.
Certain other people, including other Registered Users with whom you
   have transacted business via the Platform, can see a large part of your activity on
   the Platform.
If you book a service with a Registered User, cancel a scheduled
   service with a Registered User, receive an offer on your posted service from a
   Registered User, or have posted a service, Thumbtack may send a notice to you or the
   appropriate Registered User that includes your Full Name.
Thus, if you associate
   your real name with your Full Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name
   may be able to personally identify your Platform activities.
2.
USING INFORMATION FROM THUMBTACK
The Platform facilitates your sharing of personal information with others in order
   to negotiate, provide, and use the Services.
If you agree to contract for a service
   with another Registered User, you may need to reveal your name, email, phone number,
   or personal address to that individual so that the service may be performed.
==========
Please
   respect the privacy of others.
You agree to use the information of other users
   solely for the following purposes: (a) Thumbtack-transaction-related purposes; and
   (b) using Services offered through the Platform.
3.
==========
ACCOUNT PROTECTION
Your password is the key to your Account.
When creating your password you should use
   unique numbers, letters, special characters, and combinations thereof.
In addition,
   DO NOT disclose your password to anyone.
If you do share your password or your
   personal information with others, you are solely responsible for all actions taken
   via your Account.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
   control over your personal information and be subject to legally binding actions
   taken on your behalf.
Thus, IF YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN COMPROMISED FOR ANY REASON,
   YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THUMBTACK TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.
==========
L. User Generated Content
We invite you to post content on our Platform, including your comments, feedback,
   pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our
   Platform.
If you post content to our Platform, all of the information that you post
   will be available to all visitors to our Platform.
If you post your own content on
   our Platform or Services, your posting may become public and Thumbtack cannot
   prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy,
   the law, or your personal privacy.
==========
M. Privacy Policy Updates
THIS POLICY IS CURRENT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE SET FORTH ABOVE.
THUMBTACK MAY, IN
   ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, CHANGE THIS POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME BY UPDATING
   THIS DOCUMENT.
THUMBTACK WILL POST ITS UPDATED POLICY ON THE WEBSITE ON THIS PAGE
   AND FOR ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO THIS POLICY WILL POST NOTICE OF THE UPDATED POLICY
   IN ADVANCE OF ITS EFFECTIVE DATE.
THUMBTACK ENCOURAGES YOU TO REVIEW THIS POLICY
   REGULARLY FOR ANY CHANGES.
YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS WEBSITE AND/OR CONTINUED
   PROVISION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE
   THEN-CURRENT POLICY.
N. Notice to Non-U.S. Users
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data
   will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy
   regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the
   world, such as the European Union.
If you create an Account with the Platform as a
   visitor from outside the United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this
   Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States,
   which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the
   European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information
   as described in this Policy.
