About SundaySky
SundaySky is a pioneer in serving online video ads that are personalized to our customers’ customers.
The objective is to present personalized video ads to viewers that express interest in our customers’ websites, as visitors browse the web.
The rationale is that by doing that, the advertisements presented are more relevant to viewers.
One may see these ads when visiting other websites that publish online video ads.
SundaySky strongly believes that this approach is beneficial for both our customers and their website visitors as each viewer is presented with the advertising message that will match his or her specific preferences.
By doing this, viewers get ads that are more interesting for them, so they are less likely to be annoyed by them and are, as we’ve seen, significantly more likely to engage with them in search for additional information or to take advantage of a specific offer.

What information does SundaySky collect about me?
SundaySky does not collect any personal information that can be used to identify you.
Personal information means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.
The data collected is completely anonymous and includes information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as the Internet Browser you are using, whether you have visited one of our customer’s websites or aggregated information about the use of our customer’s website and services.
What SundaySky is aware of, is that a certain user (no name, address, email address etc.) viewed a several products lately and this information is used to present video messages that are relevant to those products; for example, a discount coupon that may be offered on a product that you were reading about yesterday.
We may sometimes receive information about consumers from third parties to enhance our video advertising retargeting solution, as well.
The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the applicable third party data collector as well as the website using the data; it is not governed by this privacy policy.

How is this anonymous information collected?
SundaySky collects the anonymous information through the use of browser cookies.
Those cookies record, for example, which pages you browsed on our customers’ websites.
SundaySky conducts a statistical analysis on very large numbers (many millions) of such cookies and based on that decides what the optimal set of video messages is to present to users with different cookie types.
When you visit our customers’ websites that SundaySky is integrated with, your browser sends the anonymous cookie and based on the information stored there, you should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without SundaySky.
SundaySky has no way to identify you in person throughout this process.

You can remove our cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
Where will you see SundaySky advertisements?
SundaySky runs our advertisements on many Internet websites as part of their video programming, typically before or during the playback of a video that you chose to watch.
Many of these video publishers are accessible to SundaySky through third-party advertising networks or video ad exchanges.
Those networks may also place cookies on your browser upon visiting a SundaySky customer’s website to facilitate ad serving as described above.
You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.
In addition, you can opt out of any other third party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.

If you no longer want to be exposed to SundaySky retargeted video ads you can opt-out here.
Please note that the opt-out mechanism relies on a cookie that is set on your browser in order to recognize you as a user who opted-out.
You must opt-out again if you clear that cookie from your browser or if you use a different internet browser or computer.
