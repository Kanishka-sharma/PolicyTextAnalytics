Privacy Policy

Meraki, Inc. (referenced to in this privacy policy as "Meraki", "we", "us", and "our") is the sole owner and operator of this site.
This Privacy Policy applies to the Meraki Web site (located at www.meraki.com) and governs data collection and usage.
Meraki knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.
We have established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand how we use and protect your Personal Information.
==========
"Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address, an e-mail address, or other contact information, whether at work or at home.
By visiting any of Meraki’s websites, or using a Meraki product, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
Highlights

Meraki doesn't require you to provide personal information to access the Internet on one of our networks.
==========
However, if you do, we will keep that information private and not share it with anyone, except under special circumstances that are specified in the privacy policy.
If we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality measures.
We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside Meraki.
Read more in the full privacy policy below.
What Information Does Meraki Collect?
You can visit Meraki’s web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
==========
However, if you request customer service or request to have a member of our sales department contact you, we may ask for your name, email address, phone number and company name in order to provide the appropriate service.
You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
Generally, once you have purchased a Meraki product or service, Personal Information is not required to access the Internet via such Meraki product or service.
When you browse the web using our equipment, our systems log the URLs and content of websites you visit, searches you make, and clicks on content.
We track the location of the Meraki node you are accessing and your network device's (ie.
PC, Wi-Fi-enabled phone, etc.) hardware address.
==========
Meraki does not log the information you enter into web forms, including user names and passwords, with the exception of web forms that are hosted by Meraki.
We may set cookies in your browser or use your Internet Protocol (IP) address as a unique identifier to track your interests and gather usage information for aggregate use.
IP addresses are not linked to Personal Information.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once.
Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Cookies are used by our suppliers and third party vendors to enable the targeting and customization of content.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Depending on the device being used, cookies may be stored locally on your device, or on servers operated by Meraki.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.
These third party suppliers and vendors also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
==========
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
==========
Targeted Content and Advertising
Meraki uses this tracking information for the following purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous aggregate reporting for internal and external clients.
This targeting process is based on anonymous surfing behavior and will not include your Personal Information.

==========
In order to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third party sources.
To enrich our Profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.

These companies do not have any right to share this information, except in the aggregate summary level with Meraki’s explicit consent.
This information does not contain any personally identifiable information.
==========
As we grow, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units.
In such transactions, Personal Information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
Also, if Meraki, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Personal Information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
==========
You will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
We release Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our posted policies or contractual arrangements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Meraki, our users, or others.
We may transfer Personal Information across borders and from your country to other countries around the world, and store Personal Information anywhere in the world.
If you are subject to the European Union Data Protection Directive, laws implementing the Directive, or similar laws, by giving us your Personal Information, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information outside of the European Union to the United States and other countries and to the use of your Personal Information by Meraki as described in this Privacy Policy.

6.4 Exclusion and Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT WILL MERAKI OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, USE OF USER INFORMATION, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICE OR USE OF THE SERVICE THROUGH CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT BY ANYONE ELSE, EVEN IF MERAKI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IN NO CASE WILL MERAKI’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER AND ANYONE WHO USES THE MERAKI SERVICE THROUGH CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT, FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER ANY THEORY OF LAW, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT CUSTOMER PAID TO MERAKI IN THE PRECEDING TWELVE (12) MONTHS.
CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT THESE LIMITATIONS OF MERAKI’S AND MERAKI’S SUPPLIERS’ LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to Customer, in which case Meraki’s liabilities shall be limited to the maximum extent allowed by law.
6.5 Indemnity.
CUSTOMER AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS MERAKI FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, INJURIES, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS ALLEGING NEGLIGENCE, COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND/OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT AGAINST MERAKI OR THE MERAKI SERVICE, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF CUSTOMER’S BREACH OF ANY TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER’S OR ITS END USEER’S MISUSE OF THE SERVICE, OR CUSTOMER’S UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION OR ALTERATION OF THE MERAKI HARDWARE OR MERAKI SOFTWARE.
