What Information We Collect And What We Use It For
Personally Identifiable Information
We collect Personally identifiable information (“PII”) in connection with the Site.
PII is information that can be used to identify an individual User, for example, a person’s name, home address, email address, or phone number.
We receive and store any PII Users enter on our Site, send to us in an email, or voluntarily provide to us in any other way.
Registering to become a customer of Intent Media (our “Clients”) requires the submission of PII to our company, including name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, website URL, credit card, and/or other payment information.
==========
We use this information to service accounts and respond to inquiries.
We will only use the contact information of Clients for communications related to our business matters.
Registered Clients may reach us through the “Contact Us” links on our Site to update or correct their personal information.
==========
Our Advertising Service does not intentionally collect information that reveals your real-world identity, such as your name, address, phone number, or Social Security Number.
Intent Media collects data about your computer or device through the use of cookies, web-beacons and other similar technologies, as explained below.
This information is pseudonymous and is not considered to be personal information in many jurisdictions in which we operate.
In some other jurisdictions in which we operate, in certain contexts, such information, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other pseudonymous information, may be considered personal information.
==========
Intent Media collects PII from Users in connection with its Site Customization Service when Users voluntarily register on Client websites or wifi portals.
When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, country of residence, or postal or zip code.
If you choose to use Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter to register instead of manually entering your data, we may access your general social information in accordance with the respective Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter terms, the permission you have granted our application, and your privacy settings.
==========
Sensitive Information
Intent Media does not collect any of the following data in connection with the Services: social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers; insurance plan numbers; financial account numbers; information that describes the real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices (though we do collect IP addresses, which can provide approximate geographic location); or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic, and family medical history.
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
Intent Media collects non-personally identifiable information via the Site.
Non-personally identifiable information is information that generally can’t be used by us to identify you personally.
We also collect non-personally identifiable data in connection with our Advertising Service and our Site Customization Service, and we sometimes enable other third-parties to collect information in connection with our Advertising Service.
In order to customize the online user experience and provide our Clients with useful statistics and analysis regarding their websites and advertisements, Intent Media may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to a User’s purchasing intent, usage information, transaction information, IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.
==========
Cross-Device Advertising
In some cases, we are able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or mobile device should be associated with the same identifier that we have previously assigned to another computer or mobile device.
In other words, in such cases we are able to infer that a device (e.g. your computer) and another device (e.g. your smartphone) are used by the same user.
Where we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices, and to improve the services we provide to our clients.
We refer to this as cross-device advertising.
==========
Data Integrity
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
How Collected Information Is Used
The non-personally identifiable data that Intent Media or its third party advertising technology vendors collect are used to better target advertisements and other content to people on the Client websites and wifi portals they visit.
The data may also be used to predict responses to custom content, to help determine which content performs best, and to evaluate which content is most appropriate for a given User.
In addition, we may use the data to analyze trends, administer the Site and the Services, customize the advertising and content Users may see, track Users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We may use different types of technology, including cookies and web beacons (see more information below), to collect such pseudonymous information and target the most relevant content to Users based on such information.
==========
Data may also be combined with non-personally identifiable information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to consumers’ preferences and behaviors, and for other Intent Media sales and marketing efforts.
The PII that Intent Media collects through its Site Customization Service is used to personalize communication and provide an enhanced user experience on Client websites and wifi portals.
In addition, Users’ information may be used, in accordance with the terms of registration, as part of the marketing programs of the Client on whose website or wifi portal the information is submitted.
Data may also be combined with non-personally identifiable information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to consumers’ preferences and behaviors, and for other Intent Media sales and marketing efforts.
If a User voluntarily provides Intent Media with PII in an email or by completing an online form, we will use that PII only to contact such User to respond to such User’s inquiry.
==========
Sharing with Third Parties, Onward Transfer
We may employ third-party companies and individuals to process payments, to facilitate the Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform operational services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services’ features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used.
These third parties may have access to information we’ve collected but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
We may also provide the information of Clients to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing the Services.
Intent Media may share aggregate information about Clients and Users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.
Intent Media may share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties for the purpose of allowing those entities to better target custom content.
We do not use information about health-related topics to target ads or other content to Users.
==========
For Users who are notified during registration for our Site Customization Service, we may share a User’s PII with the Client on whose website or wifi portal the registration occurs, as part of the marketing programs of the Client.
Clients are bound to use the data only for purposes agreed to by the User and to provide the same level of protection as defined in this policy.
Clients are also required to notify Us if they can no longer meet this obligation, in which case they are bound to cease processing the data or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate.
==========
Intent Media may disclose any information in our systems if we believe that doing so is legally required, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or if it is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of other persons, entities, facilities, equipment or the Services.
We may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we will provide a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of information, as well as any choices we may offer regarding the information in our systems.
==========
In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Intent Media is potentially liable.
User Segmentation
We may also use the data that we collect to aggregate groups of Users, referred to as “segments,” based upon their behavior.
We may give our Clients a limited right to use segments as a basis for targeting and displaying advertisements and other content that are intended to reflect the intents and interests of Users associated with a given segment.
==========
Cookies and other Targeting Technologies
Intent Media employs “cookies” and web beacons in connection with providing the Site and the Services.
Cookies are small packets of data, which may include a pseudonymous unique identifier, that are sent to a User’s browser from a website’s computer and stored on the User’s computer’s hard drive.
The website placing the cookie on the User’s computer can then recognize the computer when the User navigates the website at a later time.
For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Intent Media may also use statistical IDs in connection with the Services.
Statistical IDs are derived from information collected from your computer or device, such as your devices’ IP address, user agent string and types of fonts installed on your computer or device.
They don’t install software or leave anything permanently on your computer or device.
Intent Media may use cookies, web beacons, JavaScript and statistical IDs for the purposes of helping us better understand when an internet User has seen or clicked on an advertisement.
==========
These technologies will help us tailor advertising messages served via the Services, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
Users always have the option to prevent the use of cookies on their computers by changing the setting on their internet browsers to block cookies.
In addition, Users have the option to block the use of JavaScript, which may be used by Intent Media to display advertisements.
Controlling cookies and JavaScript may not have an impact on our use of Statistical IDs.
Since each internet browser is different, for more information, each User should review the documentation regarding the User’s specific browser.
Users are encouraged to review their privacy choices below under the section entitled “Choice / Opt-out.”
Users should be aware, however, that blocking the use of cookies or JavaScript may affect the User’s ability to access the functionality and content of certain websites.
==========
Data Retention
The cookies we set in connection with the Services expire after no more than five years, and the expiration date may update every time you encounter our server.
Only our opt-out cookie (see below) has a different expiration date.
We may retain our raw log data for three years.
We retain our aggregated data, which contains no pseudonymous identifiers or personal data, indefinitely.
==========
Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use.
This also includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption.
Any data that is stored on Intent Media’s servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public.
Intent Media has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs.
==========
No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Please send questions about security on our Site to privacy@intentmedia.com.
==========
Choice / Opt-out
If you’d like to opt out from having Intent Media use your information in connection with the Advertising Service, please click here.
When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer, which tells our Advertising Service not to use your data to target advertisements on your device with data collected from different sites.
You may also opt out of Intent Media’s behavioral advertising and other companies’ behavioral advertising at YourOnlineChoices.eu in Europe or via the Network Advertising Initiative in the United States.
Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
==========
Individuals looking to limit the use and disclosure of their personal data may contact Intent Media at privacy@intentmedia.com, and we will purge their personal data.
Yet for Clients or former Clients, we may not be able to purge the data.
