JW Player Privacy Policy
JW Player (LongTail Ad Solutions, Inc., LongTail, Company, we, our or us) is an online video software company.
Our primary offerings are a video player and a video content management system (collectively, the technology Platform).
Our products and services (the Services) enable websites to embed video, stream and host videos and deliver advertising across the web.
The Company primarily serves three groups: those who surf the web (Users), those who provide video and other types of content (Publishers) and those who advertise their products and services (Advertisers).
Publishers place our products on their websites so Users may view videos.
In some cases, Advertisers place advertising messages via our products and services via third-party ad servers.
We help the Publishers understand how videos are being viewed on their websites.
We also help Advertisers understand which of their ads were viewed so they can better understand which ads are more effective.

Privacy Practices for our Technology Platform
We offer Publishers the Platform to upload videos, manage video content and gain insight into how Users watch video within our easy to use online dashboard.
Our Platform tools collect certain non-personally identifiable information from User interactions with the videos Publishers upload via our Platform tools.
This information includes: the User’s IP address, browser type, Internet Service Provider, computer (or mobile device’s) operating system.
We also collect the URL of the page where our Platform tools are enabled, the referring URL, the version of the video player the Publisher is utilizing, when and how long the video was played, which advertising message(s) were inserted into the video, whether the video was played in full screen mode, and certain meta data about the video or the Publisher’s web page.
We use this information in a number of ways, including: a) to help us ensure that the web content is deploying accurately, b) to help us, our Publishers and our Advertisers understand how the web content and advertising we deploy is being viewed by Users, and c) to help ensure that the advertising and videos are both appropriate and relevant to User interests.
