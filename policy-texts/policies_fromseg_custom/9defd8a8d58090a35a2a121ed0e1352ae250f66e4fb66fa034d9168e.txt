Carbon is the Revenue Management Platform operated by Carbon (AI) Limited (“us”, “we”, “our” and includes our Group Companies and affiliates) and our clients, IntentMatch is our Intent based Ad delivery Platform and AdIQ is our real-time Ad Unit optimisation tool.
==========
Our vision is to support an advertising funded internet by allowing our Publisher clients to deliver personalised advertising to your devices and measure its value and performance in return for the free content they provide.
As an internet user you should see more relevant advertising where our platform is in use.
==========
We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and we never process data which allows you to be identified as an individual such as name, email or postal address unless we have your consent to do so.
This policy is intended to inform you how we, Carbon, our partners and our clients collect, use and disclose your information along with your options for managing your preferences.
This policy does not apply to our partners and clients who each have their own privacy policies covering their use and disclosure of information.
==========
As part of our commitment to privacy, We are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”)  and participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program.
We adhere to each of their codes of conduct and principles and you can learn more at the NAI about interest based advertising and how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from any of their members.

How we collect information
We and our partners use the following common online technologies to collect information from your web browser usage:
Cookies
Small text files containing a string of characters used to identify a specific Internet browser.
Non-cookie based IDs
Identifiers stored in a browser’s cache in order to persistently identify the same user.
Pixels/beacons
JavaScript, iFrames or transparent images.
==========
Statistical IDs
A probabilistic method of identifying a device based on a set of its characteristics that have a reasonable likelihood of being unique in aggregate (e.g. using a hash of the IP address, user-agent string and screen resolution).
Hashed Email addresses
A standard process of converting a directly identifiable email address to an encrypted version which is consistent and anonymous but cannot be reversed.
We also use secure server-to-server connections with some of our partners and third parties to collect information using a mechanism called “cookie syncing” where we and our partner/third party use a “match table” to append information collected based on different Identifiers into our Platform.
