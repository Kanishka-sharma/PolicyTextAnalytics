Privacy Online
When you interact with Schwab through websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by Schwab (the "Schwab Websites"), Schwab handles personal information in accordance with the practices and safeguards described in our Privacy Policy (www.schwab.com/privacy).
We use cookies and similar technologies on Schwab Websites.
Cookies are bits of data that a website sends to a web browser on a visitor's computer.
Cookies help us to collect information about you and other visitors to Schwab Websites, including date and time of visit, pages viewed, amount of time spent on our sites, or general information about the device used to access the site.
==========
Cookies are also used for security purposes and to personalize your experience, such as customizing your screen layout.
You can refuse or delete cookies.
Most browsers and mobile devices offer their own settings to manage cookies.
If you refuse a cookie when on a Schwab Website, or if you delete cookies, you may lose functionality.
For example, you may not be able to sign in and access your account, or we may not be able to recognize you, your device, or your online preferences.
==========
Some internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference (the "DNT Signal") to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
==========
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT Signals, nor a common definition of "tracking", and because, as described below in "Online Advertising," we do not engage in so-called "retargeting" on third-party websites, we do not currently respond to DNT Signals on the Schwab Websites.
Advertising Online
When we advertise on pages within the Schwab Websites, we may use information about your relationship with us, such as the types of accounts you have, to tailor advertisements about Schwab products and services that may be of interest to you.
Schwab does not engage in so-called online behavioral advertising on third-party sites (also sometimes called "retargeting"), through which information collected about a client or visitor to a company’s website is then used to display ads for the company’s products or services on third-party websites.
==========
Data Security Online
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law.
These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
