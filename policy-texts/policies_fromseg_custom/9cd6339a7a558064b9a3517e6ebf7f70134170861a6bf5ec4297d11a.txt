DHL International GmbH.
(hereinafter called 'DHL') is pleased that you have visited our website and are interested in our company, products and services.
It is important to us to protect your personal data during handling throughout the entire business process.
==========
We want you to feel secure when you visit our Internet pages.
In the following, we explain what information DHL collects when you visit our website and how this information is used.
Personal data is specific information about personal or factual characteristics relating to a certain natural person or a natural person who can be specified.
==========
This includes information such as your real name, address, telephone number and date of birth.
Information which cannot be directly linked to your real identity - such as favorite websites or number of users of a site - is not considered personal data.
DHL is committed to preserving the privacy of users of our websites.
When you visit our web pages, our web servers always temporarily save for security purposes the connection data of the computer connecting to our site, a list of the web pages that you visit within our site, the date and duration of your visit, the identification data of the type of browser and operation system used as well as the website through which you linked to our site.
Additional personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. while completing an online contact form, as part of a registration, survey, competition, fulfillment of contract or an information request.
==========
Certain areas of the DHL websites including, but not limited to, Web Shipping require registration or a password for access.
Information obtained from users of these areas may also be used for DHL’s marketing purposes within the limits of national law.
DHL provides a right of access and rectification of personal data under the applicable legislation.
Certain shipment data will be provided to the authorities of the country of transit or destination for customs and tax clearance or for security screening, as required by the laws of such country.
The information provided would usually include: shipper name and address, receiver name and address, description of the goods, number of pieces, weight and value of shipment.
We use the personal data which you have made available to us exclusively for technical administration of the web pages and to fulfill your wishes and requests - thus primarily for fulfillment of a contract concluded with you or to answer your request.
In turn, it helps us improve the services we offer to you, and to make our website's content and services easier to use and more appropriate to you.
==========
Only when you have previously granted your approval or - if so stipulated by legal regulations - have not raised an objection do we also use this data for product-related surveys and marketing purposes.
DHL does not share, sell, transfer or otherwise disseminate your personal data to third parties and will not do so in future, unless required by law, unless required for the purpose of the contract or unless you have given express consent to do so.
For instance, it may be necessary to pass on your address and order data to our contractors when you order products.
==========
DHL would like to contact you in order to provide you with the latest information about updates to our website or our offers, news, products and services.
If you contact or register with DHL on our web pages, we sometimes request that you indicate whether or not you would like to receive direct advertising material from us.
If you are already a customer of DHL, you will naturally continue to receive necessary information about important changes in connection with existing contracts (e.g. rate changes).
==========
We use tracking software to determine how many users visit our website and how often.
We do not use this software to collect individual personal data or individual IP addresses.
The data are used solely in anonymous and summarized form for statistical purposes and for developing the website.
==========
"Cookies" are small files that enable us to store information related to your PC and you, the user, specifically, while you visit one of our websites.
Cookies help us to determine how frequently our internet pages are accessed as well as the number of users.
And they help us configure our offers so that they are as convenient and efficient as possible for you.
==========
On the one hand, we use what are called "session cookies", those that are stored exclusively for the duration of your visit to one of our internet pages.
On the other, we use "persistent cookies" for retaining information about visitors who repeatedly access one of our internet pages.
The purpose of using cookies is to be able to offer you optimal user guidance as well as to "recognize" you and thus be able to present (as much as possible) diversified internet pages and new contents during repeated use.
==========
Generally, we do not create an individual profile of your online activities.
The content of a persistent cookie is limited to an identification number.
Name, email address, IP address, etc., are not saved on the majority of our sites.
There are three exceptions:
1) Eloqua Tracking Cookie.
The content of this persistent tracking cookie is limited to an identification number and is generally used in exactly the same way as all of our other persistent cookies.
==========
However, if you contact DHL using certain online contact forms in the Logistics content area, your email address is added to the cookie to create an individual profile of your online activities.
These same contact forms also provide you with an option to sign up for email marketing updates.
By giving your permission, this also allows us to provide you with personalized content, offers or promotions that may interest you.
Should you choose not to sign up for email marketing updates, you will not be contacted in the future and your email address will only be used confidentially by DHL internally to understand your individual online activities.
This means that we can still continue to deliver new and improved website content to suit your specific needs.
==========

2) MediaMind Tracking Cookies.
