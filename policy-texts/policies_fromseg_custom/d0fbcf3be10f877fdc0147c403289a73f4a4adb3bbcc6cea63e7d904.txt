Lotame does not provide its Services directly to consumers.
Instead, Lotame’s Services help businesses – marketers, advertising agencies, marketing technology platforms and publishers – engage in interest-based advertising and marketing.
Interest-based advertising is the practice of delivering relevant content and advertising to people based on their interests, activities, and behaviors.
==========
Note that when providing interest-based advertising services to its clients, Lotame does not use information that directly identifies anyone as a specific person (such as your name, address, email address, or phone number), but we may use other pseudonymized personal information as further described below.
Lotame Services consist of the following:
Data Products and Services.
Some of Lotame’s Services, including the Lotame Data Exchange (“LDX”), allow Lotame’s clients to utilize data to reach the right online audiences for their products and services.
To provide these Services, Lotame licenses data from third party providers (including website owners, app owners, data aggregators, data onboarders, and SmartTV manufacturers) and makes this data available to its clients.
This data is called “Third Party Data.”
Lotame’s clients use Third Party Data to create data segments associated with certain interests, behaviors, and attributes (for example, an interest in travel or an interest in sports).
These data segments are associated with cookies and advertising identifiers, so that clients can send relevant advertisements to consumers on their computers, phones, and other mobile devices.
SaaS Products and Services.
==========
Lotame offers Services that are offered through its software as a service platform, including the Lotame Data Management Platform (“DMP”), that Lotame provides to clients.
These Services assist clients in collecting and organizing information about their customers from their own sources – including client websites, mobile applications, advertising campaigns, CRM systems, and data partners – and using this information for marketing purposes.
Lotame provides the tools that facilitate our clients’ collection and export of this data (called, “First Party Data”) and Lotame acts as a ‘data processor’ or ‘service provider’ in processing this data on behalf of and at the direction of those clients.
Marketing Technology Services.
Lotame has additional Services that help clients use data to deliver personalized content and advertising to users both online, via computers, phones, and other mobile devices, and offline, via more traditional marketing methods.
For example, Lotame helps clients to identify relationships across computers, phones and other mobile devices, so that a user can benefit from targeted advertising across multiple devices.
Lotame collects and receives information on behalf of its clients, First Party Data, and receives information from third parties, Third Party Data, for use in its Services.
Lotame collects First Party Data and Third Party Data via many methods, including cookies, pixel tags, SDKs (software development kits), secure file transfers, and server to server connections.
==========
Lotame pixel tags generally appear as “third party tags”.
These methods allow Lotame to collect information from websites that Lotame does not own or operate.
Information Collected by Lotame
The following information is collected and used by Lotame to provide its Services:
Demographic Information, such as:
Age
Gender
Income Range
Online Behavioral Information
Lotame collects information on your online browsing activity to determine what types of activities and products you may be interested in and how you interact with certain content and advertisements.
This information includes:
Inferred behavioral data
Websites and content viewed
Mobile applications used
Date and time of visits to a website
Search terms used on a website
Frequency of visits to a website
Engagement with an advertisement
Technical Identifiers
Technical identifiers may be used to identify your device and typically include:
Cookies
Mobile advertising identifiers (Apple IDFA and Google AAID)
IP address
Non-personal data inferred from an IP address, such as non-precise geo-location data
Non-cookie technologies
Television Data
Lotame licenses television viewership data from third parties and creates audience segments based upon that data.
==========
Client and Partner IDs
Clients and partners may provide Lotame with proprietary IDs, which are IDs that identify a customer or consumer to the client or partner.
These client and partner IDs may correspond to personal information of the client or partner but Lotame does not have access to the personal information connected with these IDs.
Personal Information That Has Been De-Identified or Pseudonymised
Lotame may use personal information that has been de-identified, typically by using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code.
We use that de-identified data to provide our Services (including to connect your activity and interests).
Lotame also pseudonymises data by assigning proprietary IDs to technical identifiers, such as cookies.
==========
Lotame analyzes the information it collects and receives, and organizes it into user groups and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions.
Our clients and partners then use the Lotame-created user groups and audiences, along with information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content to users on their computers, phones, and other mobile devices.
Clients can combine Third Party Data with their own First Party Data when using Lotame’s SaaS and Marketing Technology Services.
Our clients and partners may also analyze and organize the underlying data to create custom user groups and audiences.
Lotame uses the information it collects and receives to:
Identify relationships between different browsers and devices
Analyze the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns
Provide aggregated information about user interests
Attribute user interests to browsers and devices
Test the accuracy of certain products, including cross-device matching
Determine the overlap in First Party and Third Party data sets
Create pre-packaged audience segments
Create modeled audience segments and products
Lotame’s clients generally use First Party Data, along with Third Party Data provided by Lotame, to:
Deliver targeted advertising campaigns to users across devices
Serve targeted content to users across devices
Analyze and improve the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns
Create data-driven marketing products, including models
In addition to sharing certain data as directed by clients, we may share information that is non-personal or pseudonymized with other clients and third party companies such as advertisers, agencies, ad networks or exchanges, to provide services to our clients and to enable our clients and those third parties to analyze user behaviors or to customize the ads that you see online.
In addition, we may provide access to information we collect to other service providers, but to the extent we have any personal information we only share personal information with service providers who will only utilize the information to provide their services to us or for our clients.
If our company is sold, assigned, transferred, merged, files for bankruptcy protection, sells all or a portion of its assets, or undergoes some other change to its corporate form, information may be transferred as part of that transaction or change, including in connection with a due diligence process.
==========
We may also release information in order to comply with requests from law enforcement, government agencies, and similar entities, or to otherwise protect Lotame, our clients and users.
Political Data
Lotame creates and shares audience segments consisting of political data for jurisdictions outside of the European Economic Area.

Sensitive Data
Lotame does not collect information or create or share general audience segments through its SaaS Products and Services that are classified by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) as Sensitive Information (as defined in the NAI Code of Conduct).
For a list of the non-sensitive health-related segments we offer through our Data Products and Services, click here.
Lotame does not create or share EEA audience segments that are classified by the General Data Protection Regulation as Sensitive Personal Data.

Lotame does not generate pre-packaged audience segments that are targeted to children under the age of 16.
Lotame may collect information from children under the age of 16 on behalf of our clients that use our SaaS Products and Services.
Such information will only be retained, used, or disclosed as instructed by our clients.
==========
Lotame provides you with the ability to opt-out of the collection and use of your information for interest-based advertising for all of Lotame’s Services.
This means that Lotame, and any clients that utilize data collected by Lotame using a Lotame pixel tag or similar technologies, will not be able to use your data for online interest-based advertising purposes.
If you are a California resident, see Part 8 related to your right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
