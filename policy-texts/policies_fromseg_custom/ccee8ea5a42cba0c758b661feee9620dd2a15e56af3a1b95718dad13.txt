Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your 
            computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, 
            when you visit our site.
(Your IP address is a number that lets computers 
            attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the 
            web pages you view.)
Your IP address does not identify you personally.
We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, 
            to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic 
            within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations 
            from where our visitors come.
TIL includes links to other websites.
==========
Such sites are governed 
            by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond our control.
Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking 
            the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information 
            you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the 
            site you are visiting.
That policy may differ from ours.
If you can't 
            find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the 
            site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.
When we present information to our advertisers -- to help 
            them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising 
            on our website -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics 
            on traffic to various pages within our site.

When you register with 
            TIL, we contact you from time to time about updation of your content 
            to provide the users such features that we believe may benefit you.

            controlled database.
The database is stored on servers secured behind 
            a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly 
            limited.

            system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our database, 
            nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted 
            while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

            information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available 
            to anyone with Internet access.
However the internet is an ever evolving medium.
==========
We may change our 
            privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes.
Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent 
            with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless 
            of what the new policy may be.

            our Web site.
These companies may use information (not including your 
            name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits

            goods and services of interest to you.
