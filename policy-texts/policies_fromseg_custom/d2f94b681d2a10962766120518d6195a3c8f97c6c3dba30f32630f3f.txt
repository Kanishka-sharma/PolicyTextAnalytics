The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any New York state or federal court with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow New York substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section 8 shall be construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”).

Provider agrees that it will not seek reimbursement from You for its costs and fees incurred by it in the arbitration.
AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.

==========
For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Provider and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Section 8(b) Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Provider to resolve the Section 8(b) Dispute on terms either you or Provider, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable.
Nothing in this Section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in Court or another complaint process.
