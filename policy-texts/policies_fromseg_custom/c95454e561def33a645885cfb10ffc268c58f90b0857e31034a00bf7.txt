APPBOY PRIVACY POLICY
Last Revised May 30, 2013

Introduction
Appboy collects information through the use of applications created and distributed by third party
      developers that integrate Appboy software or services ("Developer Applications").
This privacy policy
      describes Appboy’s collection of information from end users of mobile devices who have downloaded a
      Developer Application that integrates Appboy services and from visitors to our website.
This privacy policy does not govern any collection or disclosure of information by third parties, including
      Developer Applications.
For a complete description of information gathered by any particular Developer
      Application, see the privacy policy for that Developer Application.
If you believe an Developer Application
      uses Appboy software or services but does not have a privacy policy, contact us at info@appboy.com.
