This Privacy Notice is with British Sky Broadcasting Limited and explains how British Sky
Broadcasting Ltd and any member of the British Sky Broadcasting group of companies (“Sky”) may
collect, use and protect your information.
Last changed on 06/08/2010  

What information does Sky collect about me?
The information you provide to Sky to receive services on Sky websites.
==========
This may consist of
information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of
birth.
Information about your purchase of or subscription to Sky products and services, whether
through your use of Sky websites or otherwise.
Information about your use of Sky and/or selected third party websites will be collected from
cookies stored on your device when you use such websites.
For more information on cookies and how
to manage them, please see our 
section on Cookies.
Your IP address (this is a number that identifies a specific network device on the internet and
is required for your device to communicate with websites).
We may also collect information that you have provided to other companies which they share with
us.
==========
Are there any other terms which may apply to the collection and use of my information?
Different web pages or services may ask for different personal information.
We will let you know
if there is any additional detail which applies to the use and/or collection of your information on
those web pages.
==========
I’m on a co-branded website, whose terms apply?
There are a number of websites which you can link to from a Sky website which are provided by
third parties under Sky’s brand.
This Privacy Notice will not apply to the use and/or collection of your information on these
co-branded third party websites (or any other third party websites which you may link to from a Sky
website).
These third party websites will have their own terms which will apply to the collection
and/or use of your information on that website.
How does Sky protect my information?
==========
Security is very important to us.
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology is used for
protection of information in transit for any sensitive transactions such as payments.
We also take
additional technical and organisational measures as appropriate to ensure the security of your
personal information.
==========
What does Sky use my information for?
In addition to using your information to provide you with requested products or services, Sky
may also use your information for the following purposes:
 

To monitor and improve Sky websites and Sky's services;
Market research, including depersonalised statistical analysis of user behaviour which we may
disclose to third parties;
To enable us to comply with any legal requirements, in the detection and prevention of fraud
and other crimes, and for the purpose of safeguarding national security;
To personalise your online Sky experience (e.g. to provide you with access to premium content
and services which may only be available to certain Sky customers);

Unless you have asked us not to:

To send you periodic Sky newsletters about your chosen services;
To send you direct marketing (this may include communications by post, telephone, mobile or
email) about Sky’s and business partners’ features, products and services, events and special
offers which we believe you may like, including, where applicable, for a reasonable time after you
have ceased to be a Sky customer;
To share your information with other carefully selected companies outside the Sky group for
sales, marketing and market research by such companies;
To provide tailored advertising and online behavioural advertising.
==========
These involve swapping standard advertisements and promotions for ones that are likely to be
more relevant to you.
For behavioural advertising, we choose adverts based on the content you view
on Sky and third party websites.
(For example, if you regularly view Sky Sports golf pages you are
more likely to see adverts relating to golf on Sky and selected third party sites.)
For tailored
advertising, we choose adverts based on non-internet based information we hold about you.
(For
example, if you are a Sky Sports subscriber in Scotland you might see an advert relating to the
Scottish Premier League rather than the Barclay’s Premier League.)
Can I change the way Sky uses my information, including opting out of direct marketing and
tailored and/or behavioural advertising?
==========
You can change your direct marketing preferences by contacting us on 08442 41 41 41 or through 
Contact Us.
You can also
click on the "unsubscribe" link in direct marketing emails from us.
==========
Where you opt out of behavioural and/or tailored advertising you will see the same number of
adverts but they will be the ones that appear as standard on the programme or webpage you are
viewing.
You can opt out of tailored advertising by ticking the appropriate box when registering
for online services, or via your 
My Sky account.
For how to opt out of behavioural advertising please go to 
Audience Science in the Cookies section.
If you do not want any information processed through the use of cookies, please see the
section on 
How do I manage or refuse Cookies?
