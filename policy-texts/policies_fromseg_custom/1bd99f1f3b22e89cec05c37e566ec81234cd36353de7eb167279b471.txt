This section describes our privacy practices for information we collect about you when you visit the https://www.resonate.com website (the “Website”).
==========
Collection: Resonate collects PII about you for sales and marketing purposes.
This occurs when you submit it voluntarily such as when you request that a sales person contact you or you download a white paper.
When you request information from us, we may require certain PII, such as your email address, so we can provide you that information.
==========
To gather additional leads, we also use a third party web analytics tool that identifies the Internet Protocol or IP address and domain of a visitor to the Website and the pages viewed during the visit.
As you use the Website, we use cookies, small pieces of text that attach to your browser, which we use to gather certain Non-PII, such as browser type, pages viewed, and access times.

We may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep certain information for a limited period of time, in which case we will comply with your request only after we have fulfilled such requirements.
==========
Interest-Based Advertising: We may work with third party advertising companies (“Ad Companies”) that gather information about your visits to the Website and elsewhere on the Internet.
Ad Companies may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising, content, and for other ad-related purposes.
You may visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) website at www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising, as well as opt-out of this form of advertising on your browser for those companies participating in DAA’s self-regulatory program.
If you opt-out of this type of advertising, you will still see advertising on the Internet, but those ads may be less relevant to you.
==========
Third Party Websites: The Website may contain links to websites operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from Resonate’s policies.
Resonate cannot guarantee that the privacy practices of other websites will conform to our own.
As a result, we encourage you to check the privacy policies of all websites that you visit.
OUR VALUES TARGETING TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS & SERVICES
The section below describes our privacy practices for information we collect in association with our Values Targeting technology.
==========
Resonate is a research company, an analytics company, and a digital advertising technology company and as a result our activities are split into research, analytics, and ad delivery phases.
We describe the collection, use and disclosure of each phase below.
COLLECTION AND USE
(a) Research Phase.
==========
Resonate performs research, often in conjunction with research partners, who assist us in collecting information about the attitudes, values, and beliefs of individuals (“Research Members”) and the websites the Research Members visit online.
For example, we may have an interest in understanding the views of the online population generally regarding the values that affect their purchasing of different products, or their stance on particular issues, such as climate change or healthcare reform and what a segment of this online population reads online.
==========
We may also work with partners to collect data from browsers or devices to help predict possible relationships among different browsers and devices to help us provide more relevant advertising across such devices and browsers.
To assist us in better targeting advertisements, Resonate may receive non-PII through partnerships with online and offline third-party data providers.
We may use this third party non-PII in conjunction with the information and cookie we associate with your browser, to provide more precise feedback to our customers and otherwise deliver and improve our services.
The research techniques that we or our research partners use in collecting information about Research Members are tailored based on our business needs, but in all cases where Resonate directly collects information from Research Members, we disclose what information we collect and how we may use this data.
==========
We use the research to predict the online ads that are most likely to be of interest to you and others as more fully described in the ad delivery phase below.
We do not use the information collected during the research phase to explicitly target Research Members with online advertising during the ad delivery phase described below.
To the extent that an individual might be a Research Member and the recipient of advertisement delivered by Resonate this would be coincidental.
==========
(b) Analytics Phase.
During the analytics phase, we use the research to help marketers further understand audiences of interest, so they may ultimately create more engaging content, or highlight more relevant products.
(c) Ad Delivery Phase.
==========
By analyzing the research information, Resonate’s proprietary technology will predict the online ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.
We deliver advertisements to: (i) the websites where consumers with the desired attitudes are most likely to visit or (ii) to a webpage you are visiting if we believe you have the desired attitudes and attributes based on the information we have collected about you (as described below).
In addition, we may ask our third party advertising partners to deliver an advertisement to you if they have associated you with a particular attribute (e.g., demographic or geographic information) or desired attitude.
==========
When we serve an advertisement, we, a company working on our behalf or one of our data partners, may set a cookie on your browser or request that you complete a survey.
The cookie or survey may collect information about the attributes and/or attitudes associated with the advertisement and your interactions with it including whether you have clicked the ad.
In the event that we see your cookie somewhere on the Internet again at a later date, we use the cookie and the information associated to it to determine if we should deliver to you an advertisement that may be of interest to you.
We, and/or our data partners, also use the information associated with the cookie or collected through the survey to improve our services and to calculate and measure the effectiveness, reach and/or frequency of our advertising campaigns.
Our data partners are required to use the information associated with these cookies or surveys in conformance with applicable law.
We do not collect PII in or related to our delivery of advertisements.
==========
Disclosure: We currently disclose the Non-PII collected during the research phase in aggregated form to support our sales and marketing efforts with unaffiliated third parties.
We may also disclose the Non-PII in raw form, without restriction as well as Non-PII obtained through our delivery of advertisements and from third parties.
==========
DATA RETENTION
We retain the information collected through our Values Targeting services for a period of up to 3 years.
CHOICE
If you do not wish for us to collect and use non-PII collected across non-affiliated sites over time (i.e., Web Viewing Data) or maintain information associated with your browser or device for the purpose of targeting you with advertisements, you may choose to opt-out by either clicking opt-out in the footer or by clicking here.
==========
In addition, you may opt out of collection and use of Web Viewing Data for advertising purposes from us, our ad server DoubleClick, or by our data partners that participate in industry self-regulatory programs by opting out at https://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
Resonate adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
==========
You may also opt-out of our collection of data through applications you use via your mobile operating system’s setting.
For some versions of iOS, you may be able to limit “ad tracking” by opening Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking.
For some versions of Android, you may be able to opt out of interest-based ads by opening your Google Settings app > Ads > Enable “Opt out of interest-based advertising.”
==========
Choice is device specific.
You may need to repeat this process for your other devices.
==========
Please note, however, that opting out will not prevent us or others from delivering advertising to you.
This advertising, however, may not be as relevant to you.
It will simply prevent us from identifying you as a user to whom we have previously delivered certain advertising.
We may also continue to collect data for analytics, research, reporting and other similar purposes.
==========
INFORMATION SECURITY
Resonate has implemented reasonable security measures to help protect your PII in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure; as a result, while the company strives to use commercially reasonable standards to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
==========

This Privacy Policy is subject to revision from time to time.
We will post any revised version of the Privacy Policy on this page.
Continued use of our Website or Services following notice of such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by such changes.
