The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC (together with its predecessor-in-interest, Newsweek, Inc., “Newsweek,” “we,” or “us”) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information when you use Newsweek.com and the Newsweek mobile services (collectively, the “Services”).
We have prepared this privacy policy to help you understand more about how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect about you through the Services.
Please note that this policy applies to information collected by Newsweek through the Services, but it does not apply to information collected or used by Newsweek through other means.
Also, we do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers, sponsors, or other sites or businesses to which we provide hyperlinks or access, and the information practices of such companies are not covered by this privacy policy.
==========
Therefore, if you decide to access any of these third-party sites or services, you should review their privacy policies before providing information to them.
What personally identifiable information does Newsweek collect about me through the Services?
The personally identifiable information that we collect through the Services generally falls into three categories:
•    Information that you enter.
We may collect any personally identifiable information that you choose to enter through the Services (including in comments or other user content that you submit to us).
This may include personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, year of birth, gender, zip code, country, and mailing address.
We may ask you for information when you register or subscribe, or at other times — such as when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you provide content, or when you order products from us.
•    Automated information.
Using technologies that are widely used on the Internet, we also may automatically collect information about your computer or mobile device when you access the Services.
For example, when you visit Newsweek.com, we may collect your IP address, as well as information about which pages you visit and the page, if any, that referred you to Newsweek.com.
Similarly, when you use a Newsweek mobile application, we may collect information about your mobile device, such as the type of mobile device you use or your device identifier.
==========
•    Location information.
When you use the Services, we may collect information about your location separately from your address or other information that you provide to us explicitly.
For instance, we may use the GPS feature of your mobile device to determine your geographic location.
We do not store any automatically-gathered customer location information together with personally identifiable information.
If you prefer that we not know your geographic location, you can disable the function when you first use the Service in which we collect information about your location (or later, if your mobile device allows you to change the settings after initial download).
Disabling the geolocation function may prevent you from using certain features of the Services that require location information.
==========
Newsweek also does research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to help us operate the Services, for other business purposes, and in connection with our display of advertising (which we describe below).
This research is based on the information you provide to us including upon registration, on order forms, during a promotion, in surveys, and on your use of the Services.
We may combine the information that we collect about you with information that we have collected from other sources, such as our past and present affiliates or our subscription process.
==========
How does Newsweek use information that identifies me?
We use the personally identifiable information that we collect about you for these purposes:
•    for editorial purposes;
•    to contact you to provide information about Newsweek, the Services, or other products or services in which we believe you may be interested, including legal notices or information about changes to this policy or our User Agreement;
•    to manage your account, perform billing and payment activities, and update you on your account status (including confirmation of registrations or notices of subscription expiration);
•    to provide you with the products and services you request;
•    to respond to your requests, questions, and comments;
•    to perform business analyses or for other purposes to improve the quality of our business, the Services, and the products and services we offer, including through surveys or other questionnaires; 
•    to deliver targeted advertising, as described below; 
•    to protect our rights and the rights of others, including by enforcing our User Agreement; and
•    as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
How does Newsweek decide which advertisements to show me?
==========
Many of the Services are offered to you free of charge, and we cover the cost of providing those Services by displaying advertisements.
Many of these advertisements are targeted, which means that advertisers tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, females over 25 years old).
We display the advertisement to users meeting those criteria, but we never provide the advertiser with information about the specific individuals who receive the ads.
If you do not wish to receive targeted ads, we provide information about how you can opt out below.
==========
With whom does Newsweek share personally identifiable information?
We may share the personally identifiable information that we collect about you through the Services in these ways:
•    with authorized service providers that help us provide the Services or perform other business functions for us, such as sending emails or hosting web services (but these service providers are not permitted to use personally identifiable information that we provide for any purpose other than to provide service to us);
•    with our corporate affiliates;
•    in the context of contests or other promotions in which we identify an outside entity, with the identified entity;
•    with select third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, although you may choose up front and at no cost that we not share personally identifiable information that we have collected about you for these purposes by emailing us at Tech@newsweek.com;
•    to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
•    when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law; 
•    to enforce our User Agreement and other agreements, or otherwise protect or defend the rights or property of Newsweek, its affiliates, or others, or the safety of the public; 
•    in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale; 
•    in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form; and
•    as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
Do these policies apply to information collected through Newsweek’s co-branded offerings?
==========
In order to provide Newsweek in a way that is most convenient for you, we offer certain Services in partnership with third parties that operate platforms that you can use to access our content.
For example, you can sign up for a subscription to Newsweek on your Amazon Kindle or access Newsweek on your Apple iPad or iPhone.
Although these policies will apply to Newsweek’s use of personally identifiable information collected about you through these co-branded offerings, we do not control the privacy practices of our third-party partners.
As a result, we want you to be aware that when you sign up for one of these offerings you are providing information to both Newsweek and our partner, and you should review the partner’s privacy policy to be sure that you know how it will use the data that it collects.
How does Newsweek protect the security of personally identifiable information collected through the Services?
We have in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect through the Services.
However, no security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us via the Services.
==========
What is Newsweek’s policy regarding collection of information from children?
We generally do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
If, in limited circumstances, we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection.
In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database promptly.
==========
What are cookies and how does Newsweek use them?
Newsweek.com may use various technologies to store information on your computer or mobile device.
We use this information for a variety of purposes, such as to remember you when you return to our website or to identify your activities as you use the Services.
To do this, we may store a unique identifier on your computer or device.
As described above, advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies or identifiers.
==========
You may opt-out of the browser cookies delivered by Newsweek.com by changing the setting on your browser.
Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by Newsweek, and that you may not be able to use all of the Services if you do not allow the placement of cookies.
Also, opting out of browser cookies will not disable other technologies that we may use to collect information from you.
What choices do I have regarding Newsweek’s use of personally identifiable information about me?
==========
Email messages.
If you do not wish to receive emailed information from us about Newsweek’s products and services or about the products or services of other companies, you can email us at Tech@newsweek.com.
You also can choose which of our newsletters you want to receive using our account management system, which is available at http://app.email.newsweek.com/prefcenter/signup.cfm.  Please note that, even if you opt out of receiving commercial emails from us, we may still contact you to provide you with non-commercial messages, such as billing or legal notices.
==========
Targeted advertising.
If you would prefer not to receive advertisements through the Services that are targeted to your interests, you can inform our advertising vendor, Google, Inc., of your preference by clicking the “Opt out” button at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.  You also can manage your advertising preferences at http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.
In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements targeted to your interests.
These vendors include ad networks and analytics providers, and they use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant.
Most third-party vendors that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Please note that any changes that you make through these settings will apply only to the web browser that you use to make the change.
==========
Sometimes, our advertisers will contract with a third-party service to host their ads.
In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service to obtain a particular advertisement.
Because we do not have a relationship with these third parties, we do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt out of tracking by these vendors.
Other uses.
==========
If you would like to opt out of our use and sharing of personal information collected about you through the Services entirely, you can request that we cancel your registration to the Services by emailing us at Tech@newsweek.com.
Please understand that it may take us a reasonable amount of time to cancel your registration after we receive your request and that your cancellation will not apply to our uses of information about you prior to our receipt of the request.
If you make a cancellation request, you should not access the Services again, since we may not be able to preserve your opt-out preferences if you continue to access the Services after we cancel your registration.
==========
What happens when Newsweek changes this privacy policy?
We may update this privacy policy in the future.
We will notify you about material changes to this policy by sending a notice to the e-mail address you provided to us or by placing a notice on the Services.
Who should I contact if I have questions about Newsweek’s privacy policy?
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you may contact us at:  Tech@newsweek.com.
