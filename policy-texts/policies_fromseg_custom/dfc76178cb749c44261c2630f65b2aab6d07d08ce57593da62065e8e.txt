Welcome to ENGINE Insights.
We provide market opinion and social research.
==========
You have the right to know what data we collect and the business purposes for which we use that information.
You also have the right to opt-out of our sale of information (as applicable) without penalty.

This Privacy Notice provides a summary of key points related to our use of personal data.

What data does ENGINE collect?
ENGINE Insights collects data pursuant to market research surveys which we conduct on behalf of our clients.
The categories of data we collect may include: (a) PII such as email address, telephone number and postal address, and (b) Pseudonymous Information collected from your browser or device such as IP address, HTTP cookie ID, information about the website you were on prior to taking our survey, the city and state you are located in, browser type, computer, device operating system type and other weblog information.
We may append demographic information onto that data such as your race, gender and income range.
Some of this information is inferred, and some is available via publicly available sources.
==========
We may obtain additional insights about your browser or device from third party ad networks and data brokers that pass us Pseudonymous Information.
We collect and aggregate survey responses and give a summary of that information to our clients.
What does ENGINE do with this data?
ENGINE Insights uses this data to help drive market research programs on behalf of ENGINE’s clients who are seeking to obtain a better understanding of consumer perceptions.
These consumer perceptions are often valuable in helping our clients improve their products and services.
We process this data in order to inform which questions to ask, and to help our clients make sense of the survey responses.
For example, it may be helpful to understand that men and women in general have a different opinion on given topic or with respect to a particular product or service.
==========
We send the survey responses to each client, but typically remove PII from the results so as to protect the anonymity of each respondent.
The survey responses will contain a pseudonymous ID that does not allow ENGINE or ENGINE’s clients to directly identify a respondent.
But the pseudonymous ID is considered personal information in some jurisdictions.
==========
We don’t consider the transfer of the results to be a sale of personal information under California law, but we nonetheless want you to understand our process and want you to be able to opt-out in the instances where a sale may be deemed to have taken place.
Third Party Collection and Receipt of Information
ENGINE Insights partners with third parties such as ad networks and data brokers who provide us with data as we conduct these surveys.
Some of these third parties may also provide us with Pseudonymous Information and PII in order to give a more complete understanding to our clients of the Internet usage of the survey participants.
It is possible that some of these data transfers may be considered a sale of data under California or other applicable privacy laws.
==========
In connection with your survey, ENGINE may also send data about your device to a third-party fraud detection vendor named Imperium.
Imperium may drop its cookie on your device.
For information about how Imperium uses information to prevent fraud, please see their privacy policy located at https://www.imperium.com/privacy/.

SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy applies to ENGINE and not to any of our third-party partners.
It also does not apply to the privacy practices of any of our research clients.
PRIVACY BY DESIGN
Our foundation of building a strong privacy framework at ENGINE follows an internal framework of privacy by design.
We integrate privacy in strategy, research, surveys, and more.

Our internal procedures align our data use practices in a manner that maximizes the innovative benefits of our services while keeping consumer privacy at the forefront of our business practices and building infrastructure that is effective to guard the data we handle.
We protect consumer privacy and provide relevant services in the research sector.
==========
Ensuring the protection of privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of the data is of the utmost importance and ENGINE is careful to protect privacy as data is collected, used, and destroyed responsibly.
ENGINE has developed a strong privacy foundation and has a company culture aimed at data minimization, pseudonymization and adequate data encryption and security.
HOW DOES ENGINE PROVIDE RESEARCH SERVICES?
==========
We work with businesses whose privacy policies allow them to share information about their customers or prospective customers, or share information about those customers’ interests as inferred from their web browser.
This information may include the date and time of a visit to their store, website or mobile application.
==========
The information allows us to conduct research and provide our clients with more information about the things consumers are interested in.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
We may disclose pseudonymous information to our clients for reporting purposes, and we may share aggregated information as well as certain PII such as name, address, email address and transactions with other third parties for analytical and research purposes.
==========
We also work with third party agents who are contractually required to use data only to provide services to us.
These third-party service providers used by ENGINE include: (a) cloud computer, data storage and file storage providers, (b) email marketing providers, (c) website and b2b sales analytics providers, (d) customer relationship management, contact database vendors, data hygiene vendors, survey vendors and project management software providers, (e) customer billing systems partners, (f) login authentication providers to ensure that the logins to our systems are working efficiently, (g) social media platforms for advertising and marketing purposes, (h) outsourced computer programmers helping ensure our systems are operating properly, (i) auditing, debugging and security vendors.

==========
ENGINE MAY PROVIDE SERVICES ON THE WEB
When a consumer engages with an online survey from us, we will obtain consent to utilize a “cookie” or “pixel tag” to be placed on the consumer’s machine by a third-party partner that may collect device identifiers like iOS and Android Unique Identification Number (UID).
Information collected from a cookie, UID, or pixel tag are not linked to PII.
No PII is transferred in the cookie, UID or pixel tag to a third party.
A third party only knows that consumer by a pseudonymous ID.
==========
WHAT IS A “COOKIE” OR “PIXEL TAG”?
A cookie is an industry-standard small data file placed on a consumer’s computer.
Cookies allow websites to “remember you” when you return to their website.
No PII is transferred in the ENGINE cookie to a third party.
This website and associated surveys may contain, in addition to ENGINE cookies, other third-party cookies that assist us in supplying information that will make it easier for you to navigate on our site.
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear gif) is an industry-standard, often transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1×1 pixel that is placed in a website or e-mail.
==========
Pixel tags are used by ENGINE to transfer relevant pseudonymous information from a website or a client’s website to third parties associated with us for the purpose of providing additional research and relevant information for clients.
Pixel tags and cookies may be used to link additional pseudonymous information provided by a third party.
DATA RETENTION
ENGINE retains data it uses for research purposes for periods determined by our clients, after which the information is removed and discarded.
If you have contacted us or provided PII to ENGINE to be contacted or joined our mailing list, we will retain your information for as long as you’re active or as needed to provide you with information.
==========
FACIAL ANALYSIS
For some research studies ENGINE manages, ENGINE or one its vendors may conduct facial analysis on video submissions you make.
ENGINE will never require submission of videos for facial analysis as a condition of participation in a study, and will make sure that you are aware, in advance, that facial analysis will be conducted before you elect to submit any video content.
In the event that you choose to submit video content for facial analysis, ENGINE will maintain records related to such facial analysis for up to thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the relevant project.
==========
After that time, the records will be deleted.
