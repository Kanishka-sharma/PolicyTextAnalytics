Welcome to the Collective’s Privacy Policy.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, it will only take you approximately 10 minutes to read.

In this Privacy Notice we will use the following phrases:
Ads meaning digital advertisements;
Digital Advertising or Ad Placement are phrases used to describe of our key Services; and
Ad tech to describe the wider digital advertising industry and a shortened version of “advertising technology”.
==========
Collective Europe Limited is a company established in England with its registered address at 3rd Floor, 161 Marsh Wall, London E14 9AP (company number 07423750).
We are registered with the ICO as a data controller.

This statement was last updated on 11 November 2019.
Please check back regularly as we may need to make periodic changes to this statement to reflect updated guidance and requirements when they become available.
==========
Purpose of this privacy policy
The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide you with important information about how your personal data is collected and processed, and to help you to understand the part Collective plays in the wider ad tech industry.
We recognise that you want to have confidence in how your data is being used and processed.
There are a number of organisations that play a part in the Ad tech industry, from the advertisers and the brands (our Customers) on one side (we call this the Demand Side to reflect the “demand” for advertising space), to the Publishers on the other (the Supply Side to reflect the Publishers’ role in “supplying” advertising space).
==========
In the course of providing our services to our Customers we do not always determine or influence how your personal data is processed, and in the majority of cases we only process your data on the instructions of our Customers or other parties in the ad tech process.
For the purposes of data protection law, when we are only processing your data on the instructions of our Customers we act only as “data processors”.
However, where we do influence or determine the data processing we act as “data controllers”.
We have set out below the small number of activities where we believe we act as a data controller.
It is important to understand that even though we may determine or influence a small number of processing activities, we very rarely store or retain any personal data, for example we do not maintain a dataset or have any information which would allow us to identify you in the real world.
==========
Contact details
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please contact our data privacy manager using the email address atailor@collectiveuk.com.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.

How does Online Advertising Work?
You may not have given any thought to how digital adverts appear on the websites and Publisher sites you visit, but behind the scenes is a sophisticated system that delivers digital advertising in milliseconds.
==========
A number of the Ads you see have been specifically selected for you, based on your interests and browsing activities, but you may also be presented with ads that have no personalised content but simply reflect, for example, current product or market trends.
In order to provide you with specifically selected Ads the parties involved in the Ad tech/Ad Serving process require information to be collected and processed.
This commonly includes information about the devices you use (such as laptops and mobile phones), your location and information obtained from your browsing activities.
This information is used within the Ad tech industry to try and determine and understand your interests.
This information is collected using cookies and other similar technologies such as tag pixels and device identifiers which are deployed on, or collected from, your device when you land on a website or through a mobile app.
None of the data that we process either for our own purposes, or on behalf of our Customers, includes any information which directly identifies you in the real world, such as your name, email address, address or phone number.
==========
Neither do we collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race, ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions and affiliations or any health, genetic or biometric data) or any information about criminal convictions and offences.
We may also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for a number of purposes including for example calculating how many times an Ad has been viewed.
Aggregated data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.
However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
