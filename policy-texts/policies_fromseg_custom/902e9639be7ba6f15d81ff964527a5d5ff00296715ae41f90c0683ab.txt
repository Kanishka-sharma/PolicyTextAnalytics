Web Beacon - Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF.
We use pixels 
                                                tags or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising and 
                                                promotions.
==========
These tags collect anonymous (not personally identifiable) 
                                                information about which advertisements and promotions bring users to our 
                                                website.
With both cookie and tag technology, the information that we collect 
                                                and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not contain your

Used in combination with 
                                                cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger 
                                                than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is 
                                                used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the 
                                                e-mail.
When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the 
                                                image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of 
                                                the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and 
                                                for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set 
                                                cookie values.

Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a 
                                                site.
A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and 
                                                looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the 
                                                site.
Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking 
                                                the user's activity.
The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, 
                                                but the user's unique information will not be recorded.

                                                DAI will rely upon aggregate information, which is information that does not

                                                of the visitors' behaviors and characteristics.
Although DAI may share this 
                                                aggregate information with third parties, none of this information will allow

                                                name as well as the child’s and parent’s email addresses.
We use a child’s email 
                                                address to respond to a specific request to participate in an activity (e.g.,

                                                to subscribe to a newsletter).
We use parents’ e-mail addresses to obtain their 
                                                consent or notify them of their child's online activities and enable the parent 
                                                to unsubscribe the child from a newsletter or other similar activity.

Sometimes, we use third party service providers to help us conduct contests or 
                                                sweepstakes, send prizes to winners, or provide customer service related to 
                                                activities on the website.
These third party service providers are contractually 
                                                obligated to adhere to this Privacy Policy.
As such, these third party service 
                                                providers are required to keep the information confidential and to use it only 
                                                for the specific services they are performing on our behalf.

At any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal 
                                                information from their child and can request that any personal information we 
                                                have collected be deleted from our records.
We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we 
                                                intend to collect, use, and/or share their child’s personal information.

We 
                                                require our affiliates within the SUBWAY® Group and their Development Agents to 
                                                respect DAI’s privacy practices and not use your personal information for 
                                                purposes other than to carry out our instructions.
By applying to become a SUBWAY® franchisee, a prospective franchisee consents to 
                                                the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with 
                                                the this Privacy Policy.
We collect and use Personal Information in order to 
                                                assist a prospective franchisee in applying to become a SUBWAY® restaurant 
                                                franchisee and to assist our affiliates within the SUBWAY® Group in selecting 
                                                franchisee candidates.

Failure to provide 
                                                requested Personal Information may negatively impact a prospective franchisee’s 
                                                ability to become a franchisee.
Once a prospective SUBWAY® restaurant franchisee 
                                                becomes a franchisee, they may then reference themselves by their Franchise 
                                                Agreement Number.
In order to better service franchisees, a franchisee’s

                                                shared with an independent purchasing cooperative or other independent third 
                                                party.

                                                card information, and other related information necessary for billing purposes, 
                                                such as a mailing address for credit card validation, and bank account

                                                the payment of royalties, advertising fees, and other charges.

                                                franchisee’s agreement with the independent purchasing cooperative, the 
                                                independent purchasing cooperative may bill a franchisee’s bank account for fees 
                                                and other costs associated with the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program.

Please note that most wireless transmissions are not secured 
                                                and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages

                                                words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel 
                                                all of the user's registered wireless services with DAI.

                                                Personal Information of users both inside and outside SIBV, including the use of

                                                disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of 
                                                personal information that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is 
                                                not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and 
                                                discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing 
                                                customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing 
                                                purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as 
                                                long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.
Rather, the business 
                                                may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent 
                                                disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise 
                                                that right.

Security - Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss of
