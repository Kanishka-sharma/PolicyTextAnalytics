ZEDO's technology 
                                      uses these cookies to prevent consumers 
                                      from seeing the same Internet ad over and 
                                      over again.
ZEDO

                                      In most cases, when you see an Internet 
                                      ad that ZEDO is serving on a site, ZEDO 
                                      has been asked by the Web site to act as 
                                      an agent for ad delivery and reporting.
The information ZEDO processes on such a 
                                      Web site's behalf belongs to the Web site 
                                      and is not used by ZEDO in any way.
