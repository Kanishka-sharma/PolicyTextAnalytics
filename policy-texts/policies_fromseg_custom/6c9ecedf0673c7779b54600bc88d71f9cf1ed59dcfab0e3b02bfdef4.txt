Travel Audience
Travel Audience GmbH (“Travel Audience”) operates a data-driven travel advertising platform.
Our platform connects performance-oriented advertisers with our network of publishers, reaching millions of travelers.
Our data-driven travel advertising platform consists of three major components:
Our network of publishers, which are third-party websites using Travel Audience services to publish online advertisements on their webpages;
our network of data partners, which are third-party websites providing us with data allowing us to improve our advertisement services; and
our own demand-side-platform which allows us to provide end-to-end data-driven advertising solutions to advertisers.
What is the scope of this Privacy Notice?
This Travel Audience Product Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) describes which information is collected and used in the context of digital advertising in general, as well as the information we and our partners may collect, receive, and use in connection with our Travel Audience products and services.
This Privacy Notice does not apply to information we may collect and use on our own website (www.travelaudience.com).
For further information on how we may process personal data through our website, please refer to our Website Privacy Notice located here: https://travelaudience.com/website-privacy-policy/.
What is digital advertising?
Digital advertising, also called internet advertising, is used by businesses to leverage internet technologies in order to deliver promotional advertisements to consumers.
Digital advertising includes promotional advertisements and messages delivered through email, social media networks, online advertising on search engines or in mobile apps, banner ads on mobile sites or websites, and website and affiliate programs.
How does digital advertising work and what information is being collected?
Ourselves and our partners use cookies, mobile device advertising identifiers, and other similar tracking solutions to help us collect and store information about the users of websites, social media networks, and mobile apps.
==========
This information is typically stored in the form of a user profile and connected to a series of characters that form a “User ID”, though this is not the name, explicit email address, or explicit phone number of an individual.
As a result, we are not able – at least not without using additional information – to identify an individual natural person on the basis of a User ID.
We are able to link a user to a specific browser or device he utilizes.
Cookies
Cookies are small files that can be stored on computers to contain or communicate certain information and are an essential part of the internet environment and digital advertising.
For instance, cookies allow a website to automatically log users into an online service or provide users with personalized advertising.
Cookies can be deleted at any time from users’ browsers via the browser settings (see: ‘Cookie Opt-Out’).
Mobile identifiers
Similarly, mobile device advertising identifiers can also be used to recognize a device and allow that user of that device to log in automatically to an online service, as well as for other services and functionalities.
Users can also reset the mobile device advertising identifier of their mobile device in the settings menu of their device, as also described below.
==========
What information may be collected?
The technologies we and our partners use may collect the following information about online users and their activity, such as:
Travel related information, such as search queries and booking information on our partner websites (for example origin, destination, number of passengers, hotel stars, duration, booking values and solely in a pseudonymized format we may process: email addresses, mobile phone numbers, frequent flyer card numbers, passenger name records and record locator (the “Other Pseudonymized Identifiers”)) and other similar information relating to the use of websites and mobile applications of our partners;
Device and browser information, such as information relating to a mobile device or a browser (e.g. browser version, hardware model, operation system version and mobile network information);
Location-based information, such as approximate location information which we or our partners may infer if we are legally allowed to do so from information such as an IP address or GPS data or other online location-based information on which we or our partners sometimes rely on for the quality of our services; and
Browsing history, such as information regarding which websites or mobile apps users have visited or used.
For what purpose is the data used?
The data collected via ours and our partners’ products and services are used exclusively for the purpose of improving the targeted advertisements services.
This means the information we and our partners collect and receive is used to display personalized advertising that we believe is of real interest to the users, to settle accounts with our partners for advertising campaigns using our services, to analyze and improve our services (including for instance through cross device/cross browser matching; viewability measurements; brand safety features; fraud detection; creation of audiences which may be made available to customers on an anonymous basis), and to analyze the effect of our partners’ advertising campaigns.
Depending on the customer, we may also place our advertiser pixel on their web properties to collect data for the purpose of campaign optimization for advertisers.
==========
We may also use this data in aggregated and anonymized form for the purposes of machine learning.
Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, we may connect different data sources we collect (from our partners or affiliates) to enhance user profiles so that we may show the most relevant advertising to the user.
Through these user profiles, we cannot identify a natural person – without additional information – through the information collected and used by us.
==========
What is the legal basis for the processing of personal data?
The legal basis for processing the data is for the aforementioned purposes:
The user has given their consent
