The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. ยง 552a) is a law which mandates how federal agencies maintain records about individuals.
The law strives to balance the government's need to maintain these records with the individual's right to be protected from unwarranted invasions of personal privacy.
The Privacy Act requires that agencies collect only information on individuals that is necessary to carry out an agency function, provide safeguards to protect the records from unauthorized access and disclosure, allow people to see the records kept on them, and provide an opportunity to correct inaccuracies.
