本ポリシーへの変更
We may update this Policy from time to time.
==========
If we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email.
New versions of this Policy will never apply retroactively — we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect.
==========
If you keep using Kickstarter after a change, that means you accept this Policy.
Who We Are
Kickstarter, PBC (together with Drip U.S., LLC, The Creative Independent, LLC, and its and their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors — collectively, “Kickstarter,” “we,” or “us”) provides services that help people bring creative projects to life.
Our main service is a funding platform for creative projects.
We are a Public Benefit Corporation based in Brooklyn, NY.
==========
How This Policy Applies
This Policy describes the information we collect from you, how we use that information and our legal basis for doing so.
It also covers whether and how that information may be shared and your rights and choices regarding the information you provide to us.
If you see a capitalized word, it’s defined in our 利用規約.
==========
We use cookies and similar technologies, as described in our Cookieポリシー.
By using the Services offered by Kickstarter, you’re acknowledging you have agreed to our Terms of Use and that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy.
What We Collect and Receive
In order for you to create an account on Kickstarter and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information.
Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:
Information you provide by completing forms on Kickstarter — your name, email and postal addresses, telephone number, country of residence, login, and password details.
We may ask for this information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit content through Kickstarter, or if you contact us;
Information you provide for identity verification purposes when launching a project, including your legal name, business name and Tax ID for business entities, and date of birth.
In some cases, our payment processor will request that you provide a secure upload of an identity document (such as your passport, drivers license or other government-issued ID) to Kickstarter;
Details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services.
Kickstarter partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing, and the payment information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their privacy policies (for Stripe’s, click こちら).
Kickstarter doesn’t store your payment information apart from the last four digits of your credit card or bank account (as applicable), expiration date, and country, which we require for tax, government regulatory, and security purposes;
Information about your activity on and interaction with Kickstarter, including use of our mobile apps (such as your IP address, the type of device or browser you use, and your actions on the Site);
Information about the ways people visit and interact with our Site, in the form of traffic analytics.
You can opt out of being included in Google Analytics こちら.
==========
For more information about our use of data analytics to protect and improve our Services, see our Cookieポリシー;
Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);
Information that you submit on or to Kickstarter in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users; and
The email address associated with your Facebook account, if you choose to sign up using your Facebook credentials.
Kickstarter will also request permission to access your name, profile picture, and friend list (these permissions are governed by Facebook’s privacy policies and can be managed through your Facebook privacy settings).
We never post anything to your Facebook, Twitter, or other third-party accounts without your permission.
==========
You may decline to provide us with your information.
However, this will limit your ability to register for an account or use our Services.
==========
You may pledge to a project as a guest by providing only an email address.
However, to adjust your pledge, save payment details for future pledges, make project comments and take most other actions on our Site, you will need to finish creating an account.
You may review, change or remove your information through your アカウント設定.
How We Use This Information
Kickstarter では、収集した情報を以下の目的に使用しています。
To keep your account secure and protect our Services (including to verify the identities of creators and prevent fraud and abuse);
To enable us to provide you with our Services, and to improve and promote our Services;
To create and administer your account, contact you, and customize your experience on Kickstarter (for example, to show you projects that we think may interest you based on your previous use); and
To track and analyze use of the Services so that we can improve how Kickstarter is performing and provide users with the best experience possible.
==========
European Union Users
Data protection law in Europe requires a “lawful basis” for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area.
Our lawful bases include:
Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services, enable creators to establish and display their projects, and enable backers to find and make pledges to them.
Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data.
For example, tax laws require us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our Services.
==========
Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights.
We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
==========
For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services secure.
We may also send you promotional communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.
==========
We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well.
This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.
==========
When you create an account, we create a basic profile page for you on Kickstarter, containing your username, the date the account was created, and a list of projects you have backed or launched.
By default, your profile is private and you can choose to make it public in your account settings.
==========
Your username appears with the comments you post and messages you send on Kickstarter and, if your profile is set to public, people can click your username to view it.
If you make your profile public, others will be able to see the following things:
The account username you select, and the date the account was created;
お客様がプロフィールに追加することを選択した情報（写真、履歴書、居住地など）
Projects you’ve backed (but not pledge amounts or rewards chosen);
Projects you’ve created;
Comments you’ve posted on Kickstarter; and
If you have “Liked” a project update.
==========
If you would like to have a public profile, but don’t want others to see your name or profile image on a project’s Community tab, you may choose an account image or name that is not identifiable (e.g., CatLuvr88).
You can modify or delete certain information associated with your account (such as your username, profile image, biography and location) from your アカウント設定, and you can change your privacy settings if you want to make your profile private or adjust the default settings.
==========
クリエイターも、プロジェクトを立ち上げる前に自分の特定情報を選ぶことを求められます。この選択が完了すると、クリエイターの選択した名前はアカウントのプロフィールに公開され、かつ各プロジェクトにも公開されます。
以下の情報は、公開されず、他のユーザーには閲覧されません。
お客様が提供した決済情報
お客様のパスワードの詳細
お客様のIPアドレス
電話番号;
Your date of birth and other identity verification documentation (for creators);
Private profile information, in accordance with your preferences; and
お客様が当社に送信したコミュニケーションの内容（例えば、サポートを要求したり、質問をしたり、コメントしたり、問題点を報告した場合）
私達は、Kickstarterのサービスを提供し、改善し、宣伝し、あるいは保護することを支援してもらうため、信頼できる外部業者に対してお客様に関する情報を共有することがあります（例えば、決済プロセスにつきパートナーと提携するとき、あるいは他のサイト上での当社広告の管理支援サービスを利用するときなど）。当社が、Kickstarterのサービスの提供を支援する外部のサービスとデータを共有する場合、外部業者が私達の許諾した目的のためにのみお客様の情報を利用し、少なくとも私達と同じ基準に従ってお客様の情報を保護することを要求します。また、私達は、直接的にお客様が特定できない状態に集約され、匿名化された情報を第三者に提供することがあります。
When you back a project, the project’s creator will know your username, the amount you have pledged, and the reward you have selected.
Creators never receive backers’ credit card details or other payment information.
お客様が支援したプロジェクトが資金調達に成功した場合、クリエイターは、お客様のKickstarterのアカウントに関連づけられたメールアドレスを受け取ります。クリエイターは、お客様にリワードを提供するために必要となる情報を収集するため、お客様に質問表を送る場合があります（例えば、郵送先の住所、Tシャツのサイズなどが必要になることがあります）。そのような質問表に対してお客様が提供した情報は、クリエイターによって受領されることとなります。
Creators are required to keep backer information confidential, except as strictly necessary to communicate with backers directly and fulfill rewards.
Creators should not ask for personal information that isn’t necessary to provide your reward, and should never request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or payment information.
Contact us at support@kickstarter.com if you receive a request for information that seems inappropriate or excessive.
==========
Collaborators are third parties that creators can appoint to help manage their project.
These collaborators may be able to access the information available to creators (including backers’ names, email addresses, pledge amounts, reward selections, messages, and survey responses), and are required to treat backers’ personal information with the same care and respect as creators are.
Creators and their collaborators may also receive routine traffic analytics about their project pages.
==========
We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Kickstarter’s legal rights, property, or the safety of Kickstarter, its employees, users, or others.
Links to other websites and services
Our Site may include links to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from Kickstarter’s.
When you use a link to an external site or service, the privacy policy and data processing disclosures for that site or service governs.
==========
Retention
We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Policy.
We will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Kickstarter’s legal rights.
We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site, improve our Services or comply with legal obligations.
==========
Data Transfers
Because Kickstarter is a US-based company, your information will be collected and processed in the United States.
The United States has its own laws governing data protection and government access to information.
The rules that protect your personal information under United States law may be different than in your home country.
If you choose to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between Kickstarter and its users.
==========
Your Rights
Users residing in certain countries, including the EU, are afforded certain rights regarding their personal information.
Except where an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal information.
==========
While these rights are not applicable globally, all Kickstarter users can manage their personal information, as further described below, in their アカウント設定.
You can request a downloadable copy of your personal data from Kickstarter from your account settings page.
==========
To modify or delete the personal information you’ve provided to us, please log in and update your profile.
You may also delete your account from your account settings page.
We may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.
==========
Email and Mobile Notifications
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.
We try to keep emails to a minimum and give you the ability to opt in to any marketing communications we send.
We will send you email relating to your transactions on Kickstarter.
You may also elect to receive certain marketing email communications, in accordance with your preferences, and from which you may opt out at any time by adjusting your 通知設定.
If you download the Kickstarter app, you can manage the notifications you receive on your mobile device in your profile settings.
==========
私達は、サービス提供に関連するお知らせを必要に応じて送信します。
セキュリティ
We take security seriously, and the security of your personal data is important to us.
We follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and maintain, including using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt information as it travels over the internet.
No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so Kickstarter cannot guarantee its absolute security.
==========
Your account information is protected by a password, which you should choose carefully and keep secure.
We encourage all users to enable two-factor authentication in アカウント設定 to further protect their account.
==========
We have a Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and protocol in place in the event of a data breach.
We encourage the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities of our Services by emailing security@kickstarter.com, and we will invite valid disclosures to our bug bounty program.
