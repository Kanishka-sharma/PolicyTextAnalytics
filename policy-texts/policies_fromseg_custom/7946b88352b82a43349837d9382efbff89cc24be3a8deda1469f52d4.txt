This information is required to process, book and complete your reservation (including the sending of a confirmation email of the booking to you).

For our services, we shall collect for the following purposes the following information:
Reservation orders: For the purposes of completing your booking and save for disclosures required by law, criminal investigations, subpoenas or court orders, we will only disclose your name, contact details and the credit card details to the relevant hotel with which a booking is made.

However, please note that from time to time, we may use third party distributors which provide certain services and functions for and on our behalf.
These third party distributors may have access to (part of your) personal information in order to perform their services and functions, but are subject to a confidentiality obligation pursuant to which they cannot use, share or disclose the information for any other purpose.
==========

The review can also be completed anonymously.
By completing the guest review, you agree that the completed guest review can be uploaded to and used on our website at the relevant hotel information page and on such other platforms and social media (wholly or partly) owned, controlled, managed or hosted by us or our trusted business partners for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers on the service (level) and quality of the relevant hotel.

Control over your data
You always have the right to review the personal data you have stored with us.
You can request your personal data by emailing us at: customer.service@booking.com

When does Booking.com send you emails?
==========
After you have made a booking, you will receive a confirmation message with all the information about your booking.
You may take this confirmation to the hotel as proof of the reservation.
If significant changes are made to your booking, or if the booking is cancelled entirely, you will receive an email confirming these changes.
On occasion, the hotel where you have booked your reservation may contact Booking.com with information relevant to your stay.
==========
At our discretion, our customer service department may forward these messages — on behalf of the hotel — to the email address you have authorised for such correspondence.
Please note, however, that in some cases our system may automatically forward the message to you.
In all cases, the contents of those messages are at the sole discretion of the hotel and will not, in any way, contain information generated by Booking.com.
Shortly before to your arrival date we may send you an email, which may include information on your destination and may provide certain information and offers (including third party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in for this information) relevant to your booking and destination.
==========
Furthermore, after your stay at the hotel, we will send you a guest review survey.
While completing the survey is optional, it is our hope that all guests will elect to do so.
Your completed guest review form may be uploaded onto and used on the relevant hotel's information page on our website and on such other platforms and social media (wholly or partly) owned, controlled, managed or hosted by us or our trusted business partners for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers of your opinion of the service (level) and quality of the hotel.
==========
To the extent that you have "opted in," you may also receive our newsletter or other information periodically.
Lastly, if you have not completed the booking process — after having already provided your email address — we may send you a reminder email, allowing you the opportunity to finish your booking.
