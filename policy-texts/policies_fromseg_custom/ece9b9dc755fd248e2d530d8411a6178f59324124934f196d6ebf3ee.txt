Bloglines Terms of
Service
1.
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Welcome to Bloglines.
Bloglines is operated by WYBS, Inc., ("WYBS" or "we").
By using Bloglines you agree to abide and be bound by these
Terms of Service (the "TOS").
Any new service available on
Bloglines or any modification of an existing service shall be
governed by the TOS, which may be modified or updated from time to
time.
==========
We reserve the right to modify the TOS by posting a notice on
our website, or by sending you a notice via email, postal mail or
phone.
You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar
with any such modifications.
Such modifications are effective
immediately upon first posting or notification, and use of our
website or any services by you following such posting or
notification constitutes your acceptance of the TOS as modified.
We therefore strongly encourage you to regularly review the
TOS.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE
TERMS, THEN DO NOT ACCESS OR USE BLOGLINES.

==========
THE BLOGLINES SERVICE
WYBS provides Bloglines users with a
fully-customizable site enabling you to select and aggregate
third-party content such as, including, but not limited to, RSS
feeds, podcasts, iCal events and Widgets (the “Bloglines
Service”).
A “Widget” is defined as a
software element providing content, including feeds and data, you
can add, remove, resize and reposition.
The Bloglines Service does
not provide content but rather operates as an enhanced web
browser.
The use of the Bloglines Service is
free, although third parties may decide to charge a fee for
accessing their content in whole or in part.
Unless
explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that enhance the
current Bloglines Service shall be subject to these TOS.
In order
to use the Bloglines Service, you must obtain access to the World
Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based
content, and pay any service fees associated with such access.
In
addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such
connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or
other access device.
==========
The Bloglines Service provides the
following features among others:

RSS feeds may be added from the
Bloglines home page and their content is provided by professional
content providers or other users.
You may customize your Bloglines
dashboard (your "Private Page"), by logging in using your email
address and password  and by adding, deleting and arranging
your choice of RSS feeds.
In addition to your Private Page,
you can also create a personalized Bloglines page accessible to the
public and associated with a specific URL (your "Public Page").
With your Public Page, you can share the RSS feeds of your choice
with your friends, regardless of whether these RSS feeds embed Your
Content or Third-Party Content.
Each time you access Bloglines on
your computer, or, if you are a registered user, on any computer by
using your email address and password, the latest version of your
personalized Bloglines pages will be displayed as all modifications
made to your page are saved in real time.
==========
Sharing RSS feeds on your Public
Page.
You may post and share Your RSS feeds or Third-Party
Widgets or RSS feeds with your friends or with the Bloglines
Community by placing them on your Public Page.
You understand that
you do so under your sole responsibility and represent that you own
all the rights to, or have secured the necessary authorizations for
said content.
==========
Contacts.
You may also create
your personal network of friends, view their profiles, and easily
access their Public Pages.
You may also view your "Followers", i.e.
the persons who added you as a friend.
3.

NETVIBES
Certain features of the
Bloglines Service are powered by WYBS affiliate Netvibes, Inc
(“Netvibes”).
Your use of the Bloglines Service
is also subject to the Netvibes Terms of Service, attached hereto
as Exhibit A, and by accepting these TOS and using the Bloglines
Service you also accept and agree to abide by the Netvibes Terms of
Service.
Exhibit A
Netvibes - Terms of
Service
Welcome to Netvibes!
By using
Netvibes (the "Site"), you agree to abide and be bound by these
Terms of Service (the "TOS") and/or any revised version.
Any new
service available on the Site or any modification of an existing
service shall be governed by the TOS, which may be modified or
updated from time to time.
We strongly encourage you to regularly
review the TOS.
The Site is operated by Netvibes
Ltd., The Great Barn, Chalford Park Barns, Old Chalford, Oxford
Road, Oxfordshire, OX75QR, United Kingdom ("Netvibes" or
"we").
==========
I. Description of
Service
Netvibes provides its users ("You"),
for a non-commercial personal use, with a fully-customizable Site
enabling you to select and aggregate Third-Party Content such as,
including, but not limited to, RSS feeds, podcasts, or iCal events
through Widgets (the "Service").
A Widget is defined as a software
element providing content, including feeds and data, you can add,
remove, resize and reposition.
Netvibes does not provide content
but rather operates as an enhanced web browser.
Widgets may be added from the
Netvibes home page, the Netvibes Ecosystem or from the Internet and
their content is provided by professional content providers, other
users, or you.
You may customize your Netvibes page only accessible
through your computer or from any computer by using your email
address and password (your "Private Page") by adding or deleting
content and moving and editing each Widget.
The Site also enables you to create,
submit and/or share content ("Your Content") by embedding it in a
Widget ("Your Widget") to be posted on the Netvibes Ecosystem.
Once
in the Ecosystem, Your Widget may be selected and used by all
Netvibes users who can add it to their personalized
pages.
In addition to your Private Page,
you can also create a personalized Netvibes page accessible to the
public and associated with a specific URL (your "Public Page" or
"Universe").
With your Public Page, you can share the Widgets of
your choice with your friends, regardless of whether these Widgets
embed Your Content or Third-Party Content.
==========
The Site also enables you to
customize the appearance of your Netvibes page by using a visual
theme (the "Theme").
Netvibes offers several themes (the "Netvibes
Themes") but you can also create your own Themes (“Your
Themes") from Your Content by means of the Theme Editor.
Your
Themes may be posted on the Netvibes Ecosystem and may be selected
and used by all Netvibes Users on their personal pages, and you
expressly agree to such use.
You shall not use Themes from third
party websites to create Your Themes.
==========
Only the Netvibes Themes and
the Themes created by the Netvibes Users from their Content can be
posted and shared on the Netvibes Ecosystem.
The Themes can only be
posted and shared on the Netvibes Ecosystem to the exclusion of any
other site or personal page.
Netvibes has opened its platform to
allow publishers and developers to benefit from our technology.
Netvibes Universal Widget API (the “UWA”) is a free
widget framework enabling you to create Widgets compatible with
multiple platforms (the “UWA Widgets”).
Therefore, the majority of UWA
