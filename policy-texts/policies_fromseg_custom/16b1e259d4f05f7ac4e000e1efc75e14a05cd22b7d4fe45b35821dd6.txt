By visiting Redfin.com or making use of the Redfin Applications (together, the "Sites"), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
Some terms used in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Use.
==========

Information Collection, Use, and Opting Out
The types of information we collect depend on your level of engagement with the Sites.
The higher the level, the more information we need to provide our services.
A.
All Redfin Website and Users of the Redfin Applications
From registered and unregistered users of the Sites, we automatically receive and record information whenever you interact with the Sites.
This includes IP address data from our server logs, cookie information, the pages you request, and the URL of the site you came to the Sites from.
From all Users of the Redfin Applications ("App Users") we also collect the mobile device ID and your geo-location information so that we can interact with you; we need to know where to direct responsive Application pages and it allows us to provide geo specific information, such as homes for sale near you.
Your IP address serves the same function for website Users.
App Users can turn off our access to your geo-location by adjusting "location services" within your iOS or Android device settings.
==========
We use the information listed above to help diagnose Site problems and performance, analyze trends, customize your experience on the Sites, and administer the Sites.
Cookies and opting out:
Redfin Cookies: We put Redfin cookies on your computer to help us keep track of when you were last on the Sites, and what you last searched on the Sites.
While you are free to disable cookies on your browser, we recommend that you leave cookies activated to use some of the most useful Redfin features.
Third-Party Cookies for Website Use Analysis: We use third parties such as Google, comScore and Inspectlet to help us analyze how people are using the Sites, and those third parties are authorized to use cookies and other tracking technologies to access personal information of visitors to the Sites.
Such access to and use of personal information by Inspectlet is governed by Inspectlet's privacy policy; to view Inspectlet's privacy policy, click here.
==========
We also use the Google Analytics Advertising service to provide us with demographic data about our users on an anonymous basis, and that Google service uses a cookie that can be recognized by Google or its affiliate DoubleClick when you visit other websites.
Third-Party Cookies Used to Target Ads to You When You are on Other Websites: The Google Doubleclick cookie will inform Google that you visited the Sites.
Google may serve Redfin ads to you on other websites on our behalf.
Similarly, the Sites drop cookies on your browser that are read when you visit Facebook, so that during your visits to the Facebook website you might receive Redfin advertising based on the pages you visited on the Sites.
We may work with other companies and use their cookies to target Redfin ads to you on other websites.
Opting Out of Google Analytics: To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, click here for instructions.
Opting Out of Google Advertising: To opt out of Google interest-based advertising, click here to see your Google ad settings.
Opting Out Generally: The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes.
To opt-out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes (for example, serving Redfin ads to you on Facebook), click here for instructions.
Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
This means that, for example, if you opt out when using Safari on your phone, you will not be opted out on Firefox or on your laptop.
Do Not Track: Some browsers have a âdo not trackâ feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
==========
Flash Cookies: We currently do not use flash cookies, but we may in the future.
To control flash cookies, click here.
Why?
Because flash cookies do not reside in your browser, so your browser settings will not affect them.
==========
B. Registered Redfin Site Users (including Registered App Users)
We are required to obtain your name and email address as a condition of our licenses with the multiple real estate listing services (the MLSs) in order to allow you to access the full MLS listings.
You give us this information when you create your Redfin account.
When you give us this information at one of our events, or upon request, we will create a Redfin account for you and this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use apply.
In addition, when you are signed in to your Redfin account and using Redfin through Facebook, Twitter, or any other third-party authorization service, we may make use of the data that they provide us to further customize your Redfin experience.
My Redfin: My Redfin is a feature that allows you to upload notes and photos about a property, save searches, add favorites and x-outs, and otherwise organize homes that may be of interest to you.
We save all of this "My Redfin" information for your use later.
It is stored with your Redfin account information.
==========
Account Password Security: Your Redfin account password is encrypted on our server, and is known only to you.
Account Updates: By visiting your My Redfin: Account Settings, you can correct, amend, add or delete personal information associated with your account.
However, even after you update information, we may maintain a copy of the original information in our records.
==========
C. Home Tours
When you submit a home tour request, we will ask for your tour date and time preferences, as well as your phone number.
We will also ask some questions so that our agent can verify your identity.
When you meet up with one of our agents at the home, the agent will ask you to verify your identity, and may even ask for a photo ID.
==========
At this point, your relationship with Redfin is not just online.
D. Redfin Clients
When you are getting ready to buy or sell a home and you start working with our coordinators and agents, you become a Redfin Client.
As part of the home purchase or sale process, you will need to provide a lot of information as is customary for a home purchase or sale transaction.
This information can include, without limitation, your name, address, phone number, email address, buyer loan pre-approval documentation and seller property information.
We ask you, as a buyer, for loan pre-approvals from a mortgage broker or lender to determine which homes are in your price range, and to help you make an offer more quickly when you do find a home.
You, as a seller, are legally required to disclose certain information about your property to prospective buyers.
Once you sign a Listing Agreement or Buyer Agreement with us, your relationship with Redfin is governed by that agreement, as well as our online Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.
==========
We store all User information on secure servers and in the cloud.
We share your information with Redfin personnel in the normal course of business.
We also share some of your information with third parties.
A. Registered Site Users (including Registered App Users): We share your information with our third party partners who support and promote our Sites.
Under our contracts with them, they are not allowed to use your information for any purpose other than supporting and promoting our Sites.
If you follow a link on our Sites to a third party site, its privacy policy governs the collection and use of information you provide on that site.
==========
B. Redfin Clients:
Public Record Information: Please be aware that home sales and purchases are a matter of public record, and your name and address, the price you paid, your property taxes, and other information will be available from public sites regardless of the brokerage(s), if any, who assist in the transaction.
We post on our Sites some information that typically becomes part of the public record of a home sale or purchase.
Non-Public Record Information: We share information obtained from you that is not public record in order to facilitate your home purchase or sale transaction.
Service Providers to all Redfin Clients: Our agents work with third parties to process your home search and sale transaction, and must share your information with those third parties.
Examples include MLSs and providers of software used for document preparation and electronic signing.
==========
Partner Agents: A Partner Agent is employed by or works with another brokerage, but has teamed up with us to provide Redfin-quality service to a wider range of customers.
We'll refer you to a Partner Agent in our discretion.
If you are referred to a Partner Agent for your home purchase or sale transaction, we share your information with that Partner Agent so they can assist you.
Home Seller Service Providers: As is customary as your home sales agent, we share your listing information with MLSs and other listing websites, such as Trulia.com and Zillow.com.
We also share your listing information with listing vendors such as photographers, home staging experts and home repair professionals like plumbers and electricians, as needed.
Home Buyer Service Providers: As is customary as your home purchase agent, we must share your buying information with inspectors, title companies, escrow agents, closing attorneys, lenders, and other third parties as needed to process your transaction.
Potential Buyers: By law, we are required to disclose to potential buyers certain information you provide about your property.
==========
Negotiations: We also post on our Sites price offers and counteroffers.
We do not post your name on our Sites without your permission but if the sale is closed, the price and the fact that you bought or sold your house at that price is a matter of public record.
You may request deletion of your Redfin account by e-mailing us at customer-service@redfin.com, or by "Deactivating your Account" on your My Redfin: Account Settings page.
We may keep a copy for our records.
We communicate with account holders and Clients about their accounts and home tours, searches and sales by email.
You may also subscribe to Listing Alert Emails with customized summaries of homes for sale.
==========
