About RxList ®
Frequently Asked Questions:
Q.  Why does your RxList search
                    find drug names I was not looking for?
A.
The search uses 'fuzzy' logic
                    and attempts to match patterns similar to your input assuming
                    you may not know how to spell the drug name you're searching
                    for.
If you are certain of your spelling, an asterisk (*)
                    placed in the search string (such as prozac*) will turn off
                    the fuzzy logic feature and the search will perform exact
                    pattern matches only.
If you type in the first few letters
                    of a drug name without the asterisk (*) the search will match
                    any brand or generic drug that matches that pattern and will
                    also provide fuzzy results to increase the chances of finding
                    your drug on the very first search.
Q.  I placed an order, my credit card was charged and I didn't get my medications.
Why?
A.
==========
We do not sell anything on RxList, and we did not charge your credit card.
Chances are you've visited an offshore site www.rx-list.com which has no connection to RxList.com.
It is they who have billed your card not RxList.com.
Based upon the number of e-mails we receive like this it appears that you may never receive your medications and we suggest you contact your credit card company for a refund and/or the authorities to register a complaint!
Q.  I am no longer able to see the "Side Effects" tab.
Why is this?
That is
 the section I use the most often.
A.
==========
You are probably using Norton Internet Security which conflicts with certain features of this site and is blocking your ability to view and click the navigation tabs of RxList Monographs (Description, Clinical Pharmacology, Indications and Dosage, Side Effects / Drug Interactions, Warnings Precautions, Overdose Contraindications, and Patient Information).
Please click  HERE  for more information.
If you disable Norton, the problem should go away.
