Goodway Group, Inc. respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.
This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect through our advertising services and when you visit www.goodwaygroup.com (our website), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, and disclosing that information.
Section I covers our policies regarding our collection, use, and sharing of data through our online advertising services.
Section II covers the data we collect from visitors to our website.
Section III covers our policies that apply to the data described both in Sections I and II.
Section I–Goodway Group Advertising Services
We serve as a partner to agencies and brand marketers providing managed services for programmatic, social, search and other types of digital media.
We work with many demand-side platforms (DSPs) and data partners to create custom media plans and executions for our clients.
At the same time, we are committed to protecting the privacy of online consumers.
This notice explains our online technology and information-collection practices regarding our services.
==========
PRIVACY COMPLIANCE
We do not collect any personally identifiable information from users.
We have worked with our third-party ad-serving technology providers to ensure that we adhere to the privacy guidelines created by the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB).
Our ad-serving technology providers do not collect any personally identifiable information on users, and such providers use cookies and pixel tags in the ad-delivery process only.
More information about our vendors’ privacy policies can be found below:
Go to Google’s privacy policy
The Trade Desk’s privacy policy
We acquire inventory and user-level data information solely from companies that are approved-partner companies within the aboutads.info initiative.
==========
If you no longer wish to receive advertising based on your interests or other web-browsing behavior from the aboutads.info initiative, you may opt out of receiving these ads by following the steps below:
Go to info/choices/
Stay on this page while your browser determines which participating companies have currently enabled customized ads for YOUR browser
Check whether you’ve already opted out from participating companies by looking at the EXISTING OPT-OUTS TAB
You can decide to opt out of browser-enabled interest-based advertising on a site-by-site basis, or you can opt out of all sites at once using the “Select All Shown” feature
In order to opt out of behavioral advertising from Goodway Group, you must opt out of “all participating companies”
Click “Submit Your Choices”
Once you press submit, OPT-OUT COOKIES will be stored in your preferences in your browser.
An opt-out cookie in your browser tells sites NOT to deliver such advertising in the future.
For those companies participating in this program, there is a minimum five-year life span on opt-out cookies.
If the opt-out cookie is deleted, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you can repeat the process above.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
We collect anonymous information through the use of cookies and pixel tags that are industry-standard technologies used by many major websites.
No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.
Cookies.
A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser, which then may be stored on your hard drive.
When you view one of our online advertisements, you are assigned a number known as a cookie that is unique but does not identify you personally.
The cookie is recorded and stored on your computer in the web browser’s cookie file.
==========
Pixel Tags.
To make certain that ads served by us are targeted correctly, partner websites in the network place our pixel tags on their sites.
These tags are not personally identifiable nor do they collect personal information.
They are used to match a visitor’s browsing behavior to a segment profile designated for targeting ads to visitors, and to count users who have visited those sites and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
When you are on one of our customer’s websites (including advertisers and website owners), the website, using cookies (see below), collects certain nonpersonal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type (for example, Chrome or Mozilla) and your operating system (for example, Windows or Linux).
In addition, we collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the websites, the content areas or pages of the websites that you visit (for example, “sports section” or “technology section”), the ads you click on, and other clickstream data, none of which will include personal information about you.
USAGE OF DATA
We use the anonymous information collected to customize the advertisements you see on participating websites and to analyze if the advertising resulted in a desired action such as sales.
==========
This is often referred to as behavioral targeting.
In order to serve you appropriate ads, we will temporarily assemble nonpersonal, behavioral, and technical information to create very large audience segments.
These segments represent data that has been aggregated into large anonymous groupings.
An example of this usage is listed below:
You visit movie-theater content sites in the network of our partner sites, and a cookie is stored on your computer.
This data allows us to place you into the “moviegoer” segment.
This segmentation is anonymous and does not include any personally identifiable information about you.
The segment data would then be used to show an advertisement for a new movie launch, for example, to you when you visit another website in our network.
Segment assignments may change over time as new web-surfing data is collected and used.
==========
We then use this segmentation to report on advertising delivery and effectiveness to the advertiser.
We also make inferences from the data we collect in order to show you advertisements for products or services that we think may interest you.
We also use the information we collect to measure the effectiveness of ads on behalf of our advertisers and web publishers.
Our third-party ad servers store all anonymous data (non-personally identifiable information) in user cookies, and not on any servers.
These cookies have a lifetime of three years and can be blocked or deleted by users within their browsers.
==========
You have the option to opt out using our opt-out process described in this privacy statement.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
We do not provide any personal information to marketers when you interact with or view a targeted ad.
The user information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our service is not shared with any third party.
At the same time, our advertiser customers cannot correlate or merge any network segment information with information they may collect, process, or store in connection with their site, including personal information.
Personally identifiable information provided by you directly to the advertiser may be used the advertiser at a later time, as part of their customer relationship management (CRM) programs, for example.
OPTING OUT
There are two ways you can stop cookies from being stored on your computer and, therefore, stop us from storing and using this anonymous information:
Block all cookies (from us and all other parties and vendors that use cookies) by globally or selectively disabling cookie use in the browser configuration.
==========
Opt out of interest-based advertising from Google and other participating companies by clicking here, and opt out of target advertising from The Trade Desk here.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data and advertising partners.
You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at https://www.aboutads.info and at https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
==========
Opting out of these cookies will create an environment within your browser in which neither we nor our advertising technology partners will recognize your browser from previous visitation or online behavior.
Blocking all cookies in your browser may prevent sites from recognizing you—even those you wish would do so automatically.
You must opt out in the manner you desire for each browser you use.
If you use multiple computers (for example, home and office) or multiple browsers (for example, Chrome and Firefox), you must opt out of each browser on each computer.
Should you delete your cookies within a browser, purchase a new computer, or download a new browser or version of a browser, you will need to opt out again to ensure your opt-out status is current.
To opt out of receiving ads from behavioral advertising on your smart device, the most effective and up to date methods of doing so, you should consult your device settings, and instructions provided by those device manufacturers.
However, we provide the following exemplary information solely for informational purposes, and we disclaim any warranty or representation that the below opt out methods will work in all cases, or that they are most current:
iOS (Apple): https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074
Android: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en
Opting out of receiving behavioral advertising does not mean that you will no longer see any advertisements, it means the advertisements you see will no longer be tailored to your potential interests.
DAA COMPLIANCE DISCLOSURE
We use the Ghostery Enterprise assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA): (https://www.aboutads.info/).
As part of this service, our online advertisements are sometimes delivered with icons to help you choose and control how your data is supplied and used.
