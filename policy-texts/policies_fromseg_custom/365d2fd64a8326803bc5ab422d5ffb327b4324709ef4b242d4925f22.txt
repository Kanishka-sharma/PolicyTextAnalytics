Optomaton Privacy Notice
Optomaton is a company registered in Germany under company number HRB 16736 and has its registered office at Optomaton UG (haftungsbeschränkt) Amselstraße 70, 41363 Jüchen,
Germany
Data Protection Officer details: Privacy@ve.com Tel: +44(0) 020 3137 5730
What does Optomaton do?
Optomaton UG (“Optomaton”) is a provider of data driven marketing software, and it is the proprietary owner of a DSP (Demand Side Platform) which (on behalf of retailers) purchases advertising space on publishers' websites (a publisher website could be, for example, a newspaper website) ("Publisher").
For example, if you visit a newspaper website, and you see an advertisement for a retailer, Optomaton's technologies may be used to display that advert on behalf of the retailer (the "Advertiser").
This is an online version of a practice that might be compared to placing an advertisement in a magazine or newspaper.
==========
Optomaton is part of the group of companies owned by Ve Global Limited, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, constitute the "Optomaton Group".

Working on behalf of Advertisers, Optomaton places bids in real time for advertising space that is available on Publisher websites.
During this process, Optomaton negotiates with Publishers through intermediaries.
The intermediaries that Optomaton uses are known as Real Time Bidding Platforms, and SSP's (Supply Side Platforms).
==========
These intermediaries help Optomaton to find available advertising space.
Optomaton's DSP works on behalf of an Advertiser to find advertising space, whereas an SSP works on behalf of a Publisher to sell advertising space.
Optomaton uses your analysed personal data to display adverts that it considers would be of interest to you.
This analysis is based on your browsing history.
For example, an advert displaying a particular brand of shoes (if we know from our analytical information that you may be looking for a new pair of shoes).
Describing the process of targeted personalised advertising.
1.
When you visit a Publisher website, such as an online newspaper, that Publisher will allocate a space on the website in which an advert can be displayed, and will then offer that advertising space for sale.
2.
==========
The Publisher contracts with an SSP (supply side platform) asking it to sell the advertising space for the best price.
Some personal data is passed on from the Publisher to the SSP, such as cookie ID's, which can help with identifying you.
3.
==========
The SSP, then offers the advertising space for sale, via a real time bidding platform, to many organisations known as a DSP's, (demand side platforms), passing on personal data, including a unique identifier and an IP address, which allows you to be identified as a user.
However, not all unique identifiers are used in advertising, and they may be regarded as contextual, where the advert corresponds with the content of the website, rather than the profile of the user.
4.
If the DSP wishes, the DSP will then bid on the advertising space on behalf of its Advertiser clients (for example, clothing retailers) who wish to advertise their products.
5.
==========
The advertising space then gets sold to the highest bidding DSP.
The DSP can, but not always uses analysed personal data (profiles) of users to help with the targeting of the adverts they believe you may be interested in.
Sometimes a DSP will display the same advert to everyone, and does not therefore use profiles of users.
6.
The DSP that wins the bid for the advertising space (e.g. Optomaton) asks the SSP to place the advert on the Publishers website, passing back some personal data, including a unique identifier.
7.
==========
If you click on the advert on the Publisher site, some of your personal data (including your IP address) is transferred to the referring website, that is the Advertiser whose merchandise was being displayed.
Optomaton (DSP) will also keep track of the fact that you have clicked on the advert and been diverted to the Advertiser website, tracking any purchases that you may have made, in order to get paid for displaying the advert.
8.
During this process, Cookie ID's (or any other unique online ID) are matched together (via a process called cookie syncing) by the parties so that relevant targeted adverts can be displayed to you, and also so that the commissions earned by the individual parties for selling and buying the advertising space (as well as any commission earned on sales generated) is apportioned correctly.
