Specifically, it outlines the types of information that USATODAY.com 
  gathers about you while you are using the Service, and the way that USATODAY.com 
  uses and doesn't use this information.
This Privacy Policy, including the children's

  that we may collect offline and/or through other means; for example, at a live 
  event, via telephone, or through the mail.

==========
The information that USATODAY.com collects about visitors while they are using 
  the Service falls into two general categories: 
1.
Information You Provide to Us.
USATODAY.com may collect and store information, 
  personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply either while on the USATODAY.com 
  website or in responding, via e-mail to a feature provided on the USATODAY.com 
  website.
Some examples of this type of information include: demographic information 
  that you electronically submit when you sign up for access to certain features 
  on the Service, information (such as your name or e-mail address) that you electronically 
  submit when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests on the USATODAY.com 
  website, information that you post on message boards on the USATODAY.com website, 
  and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to 
  the USATODAY.com website.
If you decline to supply or provide USATODAY.com with 
  certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate 
  in some or all of the features offered through the Service.
2.
==========
Information that is Automatically Collected.
USATODAY.com also collects 
  and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through 
  the USATODAY.com website.
For example, to enhance your experience on the USATODAY.com 
  website, USATODAY.com uses a standard feature found in browser software called 
  a "cookie."
Cookies are small files that your web browser places on 
  your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
==========
By showing how and when visitors 
  use the USATODAY.com site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns.
They 
  also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of 
  the USATODAY.com site where you have entered preference information before.
==========
USATODAY.com also uses web beacons (also known as "single-pixel GIFs") 
  to access cookies and to count users who visit the USATODAY.com site or open 
  USATODAY.com's HTML-formatted email messages.
Another example of information 
  that USATODAY.com automatically collects as you navigate the USATODAY.com site 
  is information about your computer's connection to the Internet.
This information 
  allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you 
  and to measure traffic on the USATODAY.com site.
==========
How is the Information Used?
USATODAY.com uses the information it collects from you while you are using 
  the Service in a variety of ways, including, using the information to customize 
  features and advertising that appear on the USATODAY.com website.
==========
In addition, 
  we may also provide third parties with information about our visitors for a 
  variety of reasons and purposes.
For example, we may provide our advertisers 
  with information about our visitors that will better target ads to specific 
  types of visitors.
==========
Therefore, USATODAY.com reserves the right to use and to disclose to third 
  parties all of the information that USATODAY.com collects online about you and 
  other visitors in any way and for any purpose, with one important exception.
USATODAY.com will not use the information that it collects online from you while 
  you are using the Service, nor will USATODAY.com authorize third parties to 
  use such information to mail or e-mail promotional offers directly to you unless 
  you have specifically informed USATODAY.com that you would like to receive promotional 
  offers from USATODAY.com and from third parties.
If you choose to receive these 
  promotional offers, then your information may be used for direct mail or e-mail 
  marketing.
You may view or update your preference to receive these promotional 
  offers by visiting registration.usatoday.com.

  online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that 
  information can be seen, collected and used by others besides USATODAY.com.
USATODAY.com cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information 
  that you disclose online.
The USATODAY.com website includes links to other websites, and provides access

  through cooperative relationships with third party providers, where the brands 
  of our provider partner appear prominently on USATODAY.com.
We may share with 
  our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the 
  course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our

  the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider 
  directly for more information.
==========
In addition, certain affiliated USA TODAY divisions, 
  such as the USA TODAY print newspaper, provide certain online services that 
  are separate from our Service and may be subject to privacy policies that are 
  different from ours.

  applies to the online service you are using, you should click on the relevant 
  link on the page of the service that you are using.

  our cooperative relationship with CareerBuilder, we are able to provide you 
  with access to the CareerBuilder products and services through a co-branded

  we post the following language regarding our co-branded CareerBuilder site in 
  our privacy policy: "You may have arrived at this Web site by following 
  a link from a CareerBuilder newspaper affiliate or other affiliate.

  when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service 
  agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, 
  the public, or USATODAY.com.
==========
Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.
In the unlikely event that USATODAY.com, some or all of our assets, or our site 
  is acquired by another company, information on our visitors may be among the 
  transferred assets.
