How we collect and use information
We collect personal information on our customers in various ways, including: magazine subscriptions; orders for products by telephone, post, the internet or e-mail; readers’ offers; competition entry forms; or feedback, research or request forms.
From time to time, we may use your personal details for these main purposes:-
to meet product orders or requests for services or information; to process payments; and to keep our records up-to-date;
to tell you by telephone, post or e-mail about special offers and current or new products that you may be interested in;
to enable other people or businesses to carry out our work on our behalf;
where you have given us your permission, to pass your information to carefully selected organisations to allow them to tell you about their special offers or products and services that may be of interest to you; and
to manage our competitions and contact the winners.
We may group together statistical information to understand more about our customers in order to improve our range of products and services and help manage our relationships with advertisers.
When this is done, we only provide anonymous information and do not disclose personal details about any individuals.
To fulfil some of the above processes we may have to pass your information to other parts of the BBC group of companies which occasionally may be outside the European Union.
