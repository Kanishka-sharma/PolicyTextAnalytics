==========
In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Payment by Credit Card.
In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.

Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration.
Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full.
Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.

If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.
For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes.

==========
Overdue Charges.
If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers.
==========
And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way.
So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority.
You’ll find our official Privacy Policy below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
==========
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services.
The personal data that we collect is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy).
We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs.
Nor do we want to.
==========
In fact, our Terms & Conditions prohibit our customers from sharing with Branch any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will collect phone numbers if a customer uses our Text-Me-the-App feature—but in that case, we will collect and process end user phone numbers solely to enable the text message, and will delete it within 7 days afterwards.
==========
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Our customers can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers.
This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer.
In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
==========
We do not rent or sell personal data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data.
And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else.
To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion here of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user.
==========
These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with GDPR requirements as well.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy.
We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
==========
Branch Metrics, Inc. ("Branch", "us" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications.
Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts, and is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how information is collected about our Clients’ Users, and used, by Branch in connection with the provision of our products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how information is collected and used by us from our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the "Website"), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io.
So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you.
It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from service providers and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
==========
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it.
We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
==========
The Branch Services: Overview
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications.
Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the business.
This information is used by the Client to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
==========
Branch has no direct relationship with Users.
Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client.
Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms.
Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no universal identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology.
==========
In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies.
These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s connection service are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
==========
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising identifiers.
==========
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
==========
Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to share with Branch.
We strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
==========
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels

Information Collected By Third Parties
As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to infer that certain browsers and devices are operated by the same User based upon connections Branch has derived across non-affiliated apps and websites.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
==========
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them.
Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or third parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot be linked back to any individual person or Client, and share these reports with the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, or where otherwise required by law.
==========
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services.
After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual.
We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
==========
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps.
For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend.
When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel.
The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app.
==========
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our Terms & Conditions.
Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise.
Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy.
Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
==========
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms.
Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out: Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking here.
This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser.
Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself).
Cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.
For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device.

==========
Engagement Builder: Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns.
We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.
