As an OSP Artfire.com fully complies with the DMCA and will facilitate, in a neutral conduit role, the claims of any parties.

Only the actual copyright/trademark owner or legally authorized agent may make a claim.
==========
Unaffiliated third party claims are not acceptable challenge to seller(s) items.
Please note falsely or incorrectly requesting takedown under the DMCA may make the requestor liable for damages.
By submitting a DMCA takedown request you are certifying that you have researched the appropriate rulings and laws regarding takedown requests and you accept the liability for false or damaging takedown requests.
Requesting a DMCA takedown incorrectly or falsely may make the requestor liable for substantial damages.
Some of the Rulings regarding improper takedown requests can be found here:
http://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold
http://lightbucket.wordpress.com/2009/08/07/dmca-takedown-misuse-two-cautionary-tales

http://www.webtvwire.com/fair-use-on-youtube-judge-backs-stephanie-lenz-in-overzealous-takedown-notice-case/
If all documents are received in proper order the sellers' items will be taken down pending a response from the seller.
The takedown will occur in a prompt and reasonable amount of time from receipt of the notice inclusive of processing time, scheduling and coordination of resources for removal, and in some cases after consultation with legal counsel.
==========
Artfire.com can make no decision as to the validity of takedown requests and does not act as an arbitrator, mediator, or judge in such circumstances.
Artfire.com will communicate to the affected sellers after a takedown is executed.
Sellers whose items are taken down have 3 business days to respond to the claim with a counter claim.
As Artfire.com will forward this response (counter claim) to the claimant, the response should be directed to the claimant and Artfire.com should be copied on that response.
If a subscriber provides a proper "counter-notice" claiming that the material does not infringe copyrights, then Artfire.com will notify the claiming party of the individual's objection.
[512(g)(2)] If the copyright owner does not bring a lawsuit in district court within 14 days, Artfire.com will restore the material to its location on the site.
==========
[512(g)(2)(C)]
The Seller's response should include:

The subscriber's (Seller's) name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature [512(g)(3)(A)]

Identification of the material and its location before removal [512(g)(3)(B)]

A statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed by mistake or misidentification [512(g)(3)(C)]

Subscriber consent to local federal court jurisdiction, or if overseas, to an appropriate judicial body.
[512(g)(3)(D)]


If it is determined that the copyright holder misrepresented its claim regarding the infringing material, the copyright holder then becomes liable to the OSP for any damages that resulted from the improper removal of the material.
[512(f)]
If no counter claim is made within 3 business days the takedown will stand.
==========
Re-listing items containing the intellectual property that has been previously taken down but not counter claimed; items in violation of a court order; settlement agreement; or successful claim of infringement constitutes a violation of the ArtFire.com TOS and may result in cancellation of the account.
Repeated violations of intellectual property or being subject of similar or repeated takedown requests may also constitute grounds for account termination.
Harassing, frivolous or other damaging takedown notices that impede the ability of Artfire to engage in business or substantially impact our resources may also create liability for abusive requestors.
==========

Claims of fair use, homage, artistic use, or other defenses of copyright infringement are the purview of the courts and not sufficient to counter a bona-fide claim of infringement for the application of ArtFire.com policy.
Failure to provide a response within 14 business days will be assumed to be an agreement to remove the listings in question and desist from re-listing items containing the specific intellectual property identified in the bona fide complaint.
ArtFire.com may at its discretion, forward the counter-claim and materials to the party making the claim of infringement.
Items may or may not be inactivated pending legal resolution solely at the discretion of ArtFire.com

Item Decision Tree:


16.
Glossary for Item Decision Tree:
Additional Value - This can be either artistic or monetary value.
It refers to the value demonstrated by similar item sales in the general marketplace or the ability to realistically and reasonably determine additional value created by the action of hand altering.

Component - the individual pieces or materials that comprise a finished item.
Examples include both traditional craft materials such as paint or wire and also finished items.

The action of manufacturing is referenced by fabricated.
==========
Finished Items - Items that are mass produced and sold for final use as is, be they clothing, electronics, bath and body, or edible products.

Limited Run - In reference to the design section items that are designed by the seller and fabricated by another must be produced in a quantity of less than 500 total items for the lifetime of the design.
Loophole - as applied in the context of "Item Decision Chart", the listing of an item with minor modification or alteration with the intent of selling the component (either mass produced or otherwise) - e.g. a TV with a ribbon embellishment , or electronics with a cozy attached.
Media Content - The copy, music, video, animation, graphic, or other content that makes up the creative record of the media endeavor.

Prohibited Item - see our list of prohibited items.
Largely electronics, weapons, pornography, recalled or stolen items, items that violate applicable federal, state or local laws and items that are mass produced and are reasonably assumed to be listed via loophole to merely resell the mass produced items.
Seller - This is the person who is registered on the account to include familial or business partnerships where the item description clearly identifies that the item is produced by a member of the partnership thereby extending the account to include that seller with their express permission.
Supply - an item where intent and packaging demonstrates that its purpose is to be used in the construction or manufacture of another handmade/fine art item.

18.
==========
Artistically Arranged Items
The following items, which are "arranged artistically", do not meet the criteria for handmade, as they are not hand altered in a permanent fashion.
However the following items do qualify to be listed in Design when evaluated against Decision Tree criteria.
Accepted "artistically arranged" items, such as wreaths, cakes, centerpieces, can be listed provided they meet the following criteria:
    
        
The item arrangement is artistically created with intent to be used as decoration in the short-term and potentially as a long-term keepsake.
There exists no clear intent to resell finished components (loophole) without artistic or added value.
==========
The item arrangement does not include prohibited items.
Gift Baskets are allowed or prohibited as follows:
        
        
Handmade basket with handmade items (made by the seller).
Accepted item - List in handmade/fine art - this is not a "gift basket" as much as it is an arrangement of the seller's own handmade items in handmade packaging.
Handmade basket with mass produced items (basket made by seller)
            
            Basket can be listed alone in "Handmade Basket" category as it is handmade.
Mass produced items are prohibited in this scenario as they are deemed a loop hole to pass through mass produced items.
Mass produced Basket with Handmade items in basket (items made by seller)
            
            Accepted item - This arrangement can be listed in handmade as the basket is considered packaging for the handmade items in this case.
Mass produced basket with mass produced items
            
    
            Prohibited item  - because of the lack of alteration of arrangement form or function, and the inability to reasonably meet the test for intent to be used as decoration with keepsake potential; this process (while possibly artistic in nature), fails to meet sufficient standards to be included on the site.
Baskets either handmade or mass produced with handmade items not made by the seller (or made by a different artist) are prohibited.
Prohibited item - our intent is to connect the buyers in the primary two categories (handmade/fine art and design/media) with the creative process, be it hand making, design or authorship of media.
As such reselling another's handmade items does not meet the intent of the site.
