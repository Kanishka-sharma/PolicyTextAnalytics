Dotomi is the developer and supplier of an innovative marketing communication solution called "Dotomi Direct Messagingâ„¢".
Dotomi Direct Messaging enables companies, who want to market their products through the use of Dotomi Direct Messaging  ("Marketers"), to deliver, to consumers personal, timely, and relevant advertisements ("Dotomi Messages").
Dotomi Messages replace messages currently received within banner advertising real-estate across multiple Web publishers that are enabled to serve Dotomi Direct Messages  ("Publishers").
Dotomi's proprietary technology allows Dotomi to deliver relevant content to consumers, but not at the expense of individual privacy.
Dotomi respects your privacy and has created this privacy statement to let you know how Dotomi collects information, how Dotomi uses that information, and what choices you may have regarding Dotomi's use of that information.
How Dotomi Direct Messaging Works:
													A consumer can receive Dotomi Direct Messaging in one of three ways.
In the first instance, a consumer visits a Marketer's Web site, is shown an offer to receive Dotomi Direct Messaging, and is given the opportunity to sign up to receive Dotomi Direct Messaging by completing a form provided by the Marketer.
The information requested will vary from Marketer to Marketer.
In the second instance, a Marketer sends an e-mail to its list of consumers who have already opted-in to receive e-mail from this Marketer.
The e-mail describes Dotomi Direct Messaging, how the Messages are delivered to banners across multiple Publishers' Web sites through cookie technology, and provides the consumer with the opportunity to sign up to receive Dotomi Direct Messaging by completing a form provided by the Marketer.
In the third instance, a Marketer sends an e-mail to its list of consumers who have already opted-in to receive e-mail from this Marketer.
==========
The e-mail describes Dotomi Direct Messaging and how they are delivered to banners across multiple Publishers' Web sites through cookie technology.
The e-mail also provides the consumer with opt-out information to not receive Dotomi Direct Messaging.
In all instances, once a consumer has indicated his/her interest in receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging (either by opting in to receive Dotomi Direct Messaging in the first and second instance above, or not opting out in the third instance above), Dotomi places two cookies on the consumer's Internet browser on the computer the consumer is using at the time.
==========
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to a specific computer, and can only be read by the Web server for the domain that issued the cookie.
One cookie contains the consumer's unique Dotomi identification number and the other cookie contains a Dotomi=Yes command.
The first cookie is used by Dotomi to identify the consumer ensuring that the correct Dotomi Message is served.
The second cookie indicates to the Publisher that it needs to override its normal ad serving system and permit Dotomi to serve the Dotomi Direct Message.
Once the cookies are successfully placed on the consumer's browser, the consumer will begin to receive Dotomi Direct Messaging.
Occasionally, a third party advertising network or a Publisher may place a cookie on the consumer's browser.
==========
In this case, the cookie would be used by the Publisher or advertising network to identify a Dotomi consumer and alert its ad server to serve a Dotomi Direct Message.
Within each served Dotomi Direct Message there is a drop down menu, which clearly provides the consumer with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging.
The consumer can click on the "Opt-Out" line on the menu and will then be prompted on how to opt out of receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging.
Once the consumer has opted-out of receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging, the two cookies originally attached to the consumer's browser will be nullified.
Information Received by Dotomi
													Consumer Information Received from Marketers
													Dotomi, in the course of performing its services, will receive a consumer's e-mail address from the Marketer.
The consumer's e-mail address becomes his/her username.
Dotomi uses the e-mail address to place the cookies as discussed above.
The e-mail address is retained by Dotomi in a secure manner and is only used for administrative purposes, such as to allow the user to login into his or her Dotomi account.
If a consumer needs to update his or her e-ail address, that consumer needs to first opt-out of Dotomi Direct Messaging.
Next, that consumer must re-register for Dotomi Direct Messaging using his or her new e-mail address.
==========

													Dotomi does not collect any non-personally identifiable consumer data, such as click stream data or information about what sites a consumer has visited.

Security Precautions
													Dotomi makes significant efforts to maintain the security of its network and the data it collects.
Dotomi uses various technologies, including encryption, which are in accordance with generally accepted industry standards to protect your information.

==========
Opting-Out of Receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging
													The consumer can opt out of receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging by clicking on the Dotomi icon found in the lower left corner of a Dotomi Direct Message and login using his or her e-mail address as his or her username and access his or her account.
A menu will appear and the consumer will then be given an option to opt-out of receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging from a Marketer.
Once a consumer opts out of receiving Dotomi Direct Messaging and Dotomi receives this instruction, Dotomi will promptly honor the consumer's opt-out request and the two cookies originally attached to the consumer's browser will be nullified.
Third Parties
													Dotomi is not responsible for the privacy practices of the Marketers that offer Dotomi Direct messaging and publishers that display Dotomi messages on their Web sites.
