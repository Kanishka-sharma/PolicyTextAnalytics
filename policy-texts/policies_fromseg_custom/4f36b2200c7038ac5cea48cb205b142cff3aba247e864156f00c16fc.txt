Why Do We Collect and Use Information?
==========
Advertising supports free content and experiences we all love on the web, social media platforms, and on Internet-enabled mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to display content that may be of interest to you.
Relevant ads are less annoying and help the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads.
==========
To deliver relevant advertising to you, we may collect information about your activity across multiple third-party websites or mobile applications.
We may use this information to predict the types of ads that may interest you and to display advertising to you based on that information (“Interest-Based Advertising”).
For example, if you visit multiple websites that feature articles about travel or you use a travel app, we may display travel-related ads to you on another website or app.

What Types of Information Do We Collect?
DataXu collects a variety of information to help target online advertising to you based on your interests.
This includes information about your hardware and software attributes and your online behavior, including your browser type (e.g., Firefox or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows), Internet provider (e.g., Verizon or Comcast), your IP address and domain name, the pages that you visit on third-party websites, and the actions that you take on those websites, the date and time of your visits to third-party websites, and whether you respond to an online ad.
To provide relevant advertising for mobile users, we may also collect, device type, make and model, operating system, mobile advertising identifiers, operating system device identifier (For example, IDFA for iOS and Android ID for Android) and information about the apps you use.
==========

This may include information related to general health, wellness, common ailments, and illnesses.
==========
We do not collect information generally considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Social Security Number, credit card information, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, or health related information.
We will not combine or link the information we collect with PII.
In some jurisdictions IP Address may be considered PII.
We take steps to obscure the information collected from those jurisdictions (for example, by deleting portions of it) so that it is no longer personally identifiable.
What Technology Do We Use to Collect Information?
We use a variety of technologies, including cookies, pixel tags, and scripts, to collect information, all of which are widely used on the Internet.
==========
The information that we collect via our technologies is used for the purpose of targeting ads, measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of DataXu’s advertisers and to identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement.
This information also helps DataXu ensure that you don’t repeatedly see the same ad.
We may also use non-PII data from third parties, including advertising exchanges.
This information is transferred to DataXu in a form that does not identify a particular individual and remains in this form.
==========

Cross-Device and Cross-App Technology
We and our customers may use technology that establishes deterministic or statistical connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising analytics and reporting purposes.
For example, DataXu or its partners may match your devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or web browsers, or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household.
This means that information about your use of websites or applications on your current device may be combined with information from your other devices.
This allows, for example, ads you see on your tablet to be based on activities you engaged in on your smartphone.
==========
We may partner with third parties to provide such cross-device technology to our customers, and we may share anonymous identifiers (such as cookies or your mobile device’s IDFA or Google Advertising ID) with those third parties to make connections among related devices.
We may also use your device’s IP address to infer connections among related devices within the same household.

==========
We and our customers may collect information about your activity across multiple unaffiliated third-party mobile applications.
We may share this information with our customers to help them predict the types of ads that may interest you and to display advertising to you based on that information.
For example, if you use a travel app, we or our customers may display travel-related ads to you on another app.
We or our customers may combine this information with a mobile advertising identifier (such as your mobile device’s IDFA or Google Advertising ID), and we may retain it for up to 13 months, as described in the Data Storage and Security section below.
