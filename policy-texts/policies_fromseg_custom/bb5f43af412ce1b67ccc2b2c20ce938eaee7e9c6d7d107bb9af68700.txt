Website Visitors
Instructables collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Instructables' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Instructables' visitors use its website.
From time to time, Instructables may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Instructables also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
Instructables only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of Instructables.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Instructables' websites choose to interact with Instructables in ways that require Instructables to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Instructables gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a membership at our site to provide a username and email address.
Those who engage in transactions with Instructables – by purchasing a pro membership, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.

In each case, Instructables collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Instructables.
