Privacy Commitment
Monster.co.uk's Privacy Commitment - Overview
Monster.co.uk is committed to protecting the privacy of our users.
We want to provide a safe, secure user experience.
We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein.
The following reflects our commitment to you.
Information About All Monster.co.uk Visitors
In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most.
==========
We only use such data in the aggregate.
This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users.
We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Monster.co.uk users, collectively, use career areas and our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well.
==========
Information About You Specifically
In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc.
We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes.
We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.
General Information Disclosure
We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Monster.co.uk, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it.
==========
But we may record and share aggregated information with our partners.
Also, if you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a Monster.co.uk and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information becomes the property of both Monster.co.uk and the partner co-sponsoring the contest.
In that instance, Monster.co.uk is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives.
CVs
Since Monster.co.uk is a career site, we give you the option of putting your CV in our database.
There are several ways of doing this.
==========
You may store your CV in our database, but not allow it to be searchable.
Not allowing your CV to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but recruiters will not have access to search it through our CV database product.
Or, you can store it in our database and allow it to be searchable.
If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all recruiters who pay for access to our CV database product will have access to your CV.
We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals.
==========
However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your CV.
You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time.
However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases.
We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of CV in these instances.
==========
Feedback
Monster.co.uk has an area on the site where you can submit feedback.
Any feedback that is submitted through this area becomes the property of Monster.co.uk We may use this feedback, such as success stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site.
==========
Children
We do not specifically collect information about children.
We believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out personal information.
==========
If you are concerned about your child's use of Monster.co.uk, we encourage you to use Web filtering technology to supervise your child's access to the site.
We also encourage you to participate in your child's experience with Monster.co.uk.
With a little guidance, the site can prove very useful in finding a part time or summer job for your child, as well as providing them with excellent career counselling information.
