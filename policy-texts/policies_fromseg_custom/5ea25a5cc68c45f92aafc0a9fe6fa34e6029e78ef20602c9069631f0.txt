Information Lookout Collects
a. Registration Information
To create an account, you must provide your email address and a password.
You may also enter your mobile phone number on our website to initiate a text message with directions on how to download the app and register.
b. Credit Card Information
If you wish to upgrade to a Premium Account billed directly to us, we collect your credit card number, expiration date, and security code.
==========
We use this information to bill you for services.
Lookout uses third-party payment processors and therefore has only limited information about your payment transactions.
c. Device Information
When you use Lookout services, our servers automatically record certain information about your mobile device.
This information may include information such as an equipment identifier (e.g., IMEI, UDID), subscriber identifier (e.g., IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, operating system type and version, wireless carrier / operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the dates and times of your requests.
We use this information to provide our services, and support if needed, and to calculate anonymous, aggregate statistics about the users of our products.
==========
For example, collecting your device’s phone number allows the service to contact your phone via SMS when you locate your phone from the Lookout web application.
d. Employment Application Information
If you wish to fill out our application form, we will ask for information, including your name, email address, phone number, and allow you to upload your resume and cover letter.
We use this information to determine if you are an eligible candidate for an available position, to contact you to set up an interview if appropriate and to follow up with you about your application experience.
==========
e. Social Media Features
Our website includes social media Features (“Features”), like the Facebook recommend button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.
If you use these Features, they will collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
Features may be hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site.
==========
Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the Feature, not by Lookout’s Privacy Policy.
f. Information About Your Use of Lookout Services on Your Phone
We use analytics software so that we can improve the features and usability of our products.
This software may analyze information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, and where the application was downloaded.

We may also use such information to show you relevant content and suggest new features, products and services that can enhance your use of the Lookout Service.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.
g. Information About Your Use of Lookout’s Website and Mobile Website

What You Should Know About Specific Products
a. Security and Anti-Virus
Lookout Security products, which are available on different platforms, protect your device from malware and spyware.
They scan files and applications after you download and activate Lookout Security and as new applications are installed or accessed to detect any threats to you and your mobile device.
They also automatically scan your entire device periodically, and regularly update your threat definitions.
In order to perform these functions, we need to collect information about the applications and files present on your device, the results of any scans performed by our services, and actions you take as a result of scanning.
This may include downloading a copy of part or entire copies of application files on your device if we encounter an application that we have not previously analyzed.
What types of information Security products collect:
Information about the type of device you are using and the operating system you are running.
Lookout’s Security products collect information about the type of device and operating system you are running so that we can both improve our products and also give you more accurate information about malware and spyware that might affect you and your device(s).
==========
Information about scans and scan results.
We collect information about the applications on your device in order to conduct scans and to download copies of scanned files.
We also may collect information about how applications behave on your device (e.g., whether an application is sending premium-rate text messages that charge money to your phone bill) and the network services with which your applications communicate, in order to determine if any applications are behaving maliciously (e.g., whether an application is talking to a server known to host phishing websites).
Each time Lookout performs a scan, we collect information that describes what files and applications are identified by the scan as potentially undesirable and your choice for remediation of those files (e.g., uninstall or ignore).
==========
How the information that Security products collect is used:
Our purpose in collecting application data and security scan data is to provide you with protections to keep you and your data safe and to optimize and improve our Lookout services and products.
We may aggregate your data with other customers’ data in non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and anonymized form to better understand current malware and spyware threats and to improve the Security service.
We may also share this anonymous aggregated data publicly, in order to help others understand mobile threats and gain insights into particular mobile applications.
==========
b. Backup
Lookout Backup securely stores copies of data that you choose to back up from your phone.
What types of information Backup collects:
Backup Data.
Backup transmits a copy of the data you choose to back up to on your device to a secure server using an encrypted protocol.
==========
The data may include your contacts, call history, pictures, and other data.
Lookout Backup automatically backs up your data weekly or daily, based on your settings, can download your data to transfer to a new or existing phone, and allows you to retrieve your data any time from Lookout.com.
How the information that Backup collects is used:
If you choose to use the Lookout Backup feature, we will use the data you provide to deliver the Backup service.
In order to notify you in the case of malicious behavior on your phone, Lookout may scan both the data that is stored on your phone and backed up to our servers.
For example, some malware has been known to spread via malicious text messages or steal money by dialing expensive phone numbers.
To detect this, our system would scan the SMS messages or call history stored on your phone or backed up on our servers.
==========
c. Missing Device
Lookout Missing Device helps you find and secure your phone or tablet if it is lost or stolen.
You can locate your phone on a map using location information provided by your phone, activate a loud siren even if your volume is muted so that you can find a phone lost nearby, wipe your phone, or lock your phone.
Features and settings are controlled through our website at Lookout.com.
What types of information Missing Device collects:
Location Data.
Lookout derives location information in two ways.
We may receive it directly from your mobile device, or, in some situations, we may receive location data from cell tower or Wi-Fi hotspot information.
We may use third-party service providers to translate that information into usable location information.
How the information that Missing Device collects is used:
Our purpose in collecting this information is to provide you with the location of your phone when you request it.
If you activate the locate feature in Missing Device, your browser will send location information to third-party map providers (e.g. Google Maps) in order to display a map of the location within your Lookout account webpage.
When activating this feature, we track the phone’s location for several minutes in order to provide an accurate location for you.
==========
This information is retained in your account history for as long as you wish and may be deleted by you at any time, from your account settings.
If you choose to delete this information or disable your account, Lookout anonymizes this data so that it is no longer associated with any personal information.
We keep that anonymized data for aggregate statistical purposes only.
==========
d. Signal Flare
Signal Flare collects and stores information in the same way as Missing Device (see above).
If you have enabled Signal Flare, it collects location information and sends it back to Lookout only when your battery is running low.
After which, we save the phone's location at the time we received the low battery alert to Lookout.com.
This feature will help you locate your phone near its last known location if you lose it and its battery dies.
==========
e. Safe Browsing
Safe Browsing is a feature available when using the Android default browser or the Chrome browser.
Safe Browsing identifies and warns you of unsafe websites so that you can choose to avoid visiting them.
What types of information Safe Browsing collects:
URLs.
To provide the Safe Browsing service, we may transmit the URLs you visit on your phone to a Lookout-provided or third-party service to determine if those URLs are unsafe (e.g., if the URLs contain phishing attacks, malwares, or exploits).
If a URL you visit is determined to be unsafe, we store a record of the unsafe URL.
How the information that Safe Browsing collects is used:
We use the record of unsafe URLs you visit (1) to provide you with notice that you attempted to reach an unsafe site (e.g., when you log in to the Lookout website or via email) and (2) to improve our product.
If you do not want us to record the unsafe URLs you visit, you may turn Safe Browsing off; all other Lookout features will continue to function.
==========
f. Theft Alerts
Lookout's Theft Alerts feature uses your device’s camera and location features to help you figure out where your device might be (and who might have it) in the event that your device is lost or stolen.
If Theft Alerts is activated, the application monitors below device behaviors to trigger user alerts, which you can turn on or off at any time:
Incorrect password entries on your device or Lookout mobile application’s lock screen;
Removal or change of SIM cards;
Enablement of airplane mode;
Disablement of Lookout device administrator capabilities (via device settings or through the mobile application); and
Powering down the device (not through a battery event).
Theft Alerts starts Backup and activates your device’s camera remotely, without sound or other notification, and sends the resulting picture and its GPS coordinates to the email address associated with your account.
For example, if someone steals your phone and fails to enter your password at least three times, removes your SIM card, or powers off your device, Theft Alerts could allow you to see what they look like and figure out where they are without alerting them.
What types of information Theft Alerts collects, if activated:
Password and technical device data.
In addition to the photographic and location information described above, the application keeps track of the above device behaviors that trigger Theft Alerts.
How the information that Theft Alerts collects is used:
When Theft Alerts is activated and a photo is taken, the picture and location data are stored briefly on our servers so we can send you an email with the picture and a map of your device’s location.
The picture is then deleted.
We send the email to the address associated with your account (or for Group Plans, to the address associated with the device that took the photo), so remember to keep your email address up to date in your account settings.
We use technical information about Theft Alert’s activities on your device to study, optimize, and troubleshoot our products.
==========
g. Group Plans
Group Plans link multiple devices to one master account that controls the Group Plan owner’s device as well as certain features of devices associated with the Group Plan.
Users of the additional devices on the plan retain their own unique accounts, but Group Plan owners have control over some functions of Group Plan members’ devices, as described below.
What types of information Group Plans collect:
Lookout does not collect any additional information from users in Group Plans.
How the information that Group Plans collects is used:
In a Group Plan, such as a Family Plan, one master user has authority to perform certain functions on devices belonging to other members of the group.
==========
For example, in a Family Plan, a parent phone may be able to lock, wipe, or locate a child’s phone.
The latter feature would allow a parent to access data about the child’s phone in the section on “Missing Device.”
A parent phone, or other device having authority over other Group Plan users, generally does not have access to the data on a child’s phone unless, for example, the data on the phone is downloaded and transferred to another device to which the parent phone has access.
Users must agree to give the “parent” this functionality.
You can determine if your phone is part of a Group Plan by checking the settings on your phone.
==========
h. Customer Care Web Application
If your mobile operator participates in our Customer Care Web Application program, you can call your mobile operator to find and secure your phone or tablet if it is lost or stolen.
Customer Care Web Application enables mobile operators and their customer service representatives to perform remote functions on your device at your request, including:
Locating the device,
Locking the device,
Wiping the device, or
Activating a loud siren (Scream).
Customer service representatives may perform such functions only at your request and with your consent.
Additional types of user information Customer Care Web Application collects:
Your phone number, if available, and information about the type of device and operating system you are using to ensure that customer service representatives accurately identify and manage the remote functions on your device.
==========
To protect users’ privacy, whenever a customer service representative executes any of the above functions, Lookout immediately notifies the user via email.
Customer service representatives do not have access nor control over any user data backed up via Lookout’s mobile application.
