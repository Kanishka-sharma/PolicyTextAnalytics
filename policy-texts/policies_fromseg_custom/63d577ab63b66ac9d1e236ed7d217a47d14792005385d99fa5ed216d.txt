The following Questions and Answers address AARP and AARP.org privacy issues in more detail.
We want to make sure that you understand the types of information that are collected at AARP.org, the ways in which that information is used and protected, and the choices that you have about this collection and use.
The frequently asked questions listed below apply only to data collected online.

Do I have to submit any personal information in order to use AARP.org?
You do not need to give us any information about yourself in order to access most of AARP.org.
You can visit our pages, read our publications and learn about our member services on a completely anonymous basis.
If you want to take advantage of some of the optional services available on AARP.org, however, we will sometimes request information that allows us to identify you ("personal information").
==========
If you use the online form to join AARP or renew your membership, for example, we will ask for certain information to process your application (name, birth date, phone number, mailing address, email address, email permissions and credit card number).
If you register to receive email newsletters, we will ask for your name, address, email address and birth date (or member number) so that we can send you the newsletters.
We may also ask for personal information when you participate in other activities or services on AARP.org, such as surveys and discussion groups.
We also have relationships with certain companies that we have selected and approved to offer AARP member benefit products and services on linked sites.
On some of these sites, you may be asked to enter personal information in order to take advantage of their services or programs.
If you decide to purchase products or services on one of these linked websites, you may be asked for your name, member number, address and email address to enable the provider to contact you about your purchase transaction.
The contracted member benefit providers of these linked sites may have their own privacy policies that apply to the information you have given them and you should review these policies.
Again, regardless of whether you are visiting AARP.org or a linked website, you do not have to disclose any personal information if you do not want to.
You can always decide not to use the optional services that require the submission of such information.
The choice is yours.
We are only interested in offering you convenient online services that match your interests and needs.

Does AARP.org collect nonpersonal information, using "cookies" or otherwise?
We also collect other types of information that do not allow us to identify your name, email address or other personal characteristics.
This "nonpersonal information" includes the number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet ("IP address") and the type of browser you use.
None of this nonpersonal information allows us to identify or contact you.
We use this information to help us evaluate how AARP.org is being used.
By gathering this information, we can learn, among other things, how many people visit AARP.org, which AARP.org pages are the most and least popular, and which other websites are the most frequent referral sources for AARP.org.
==========
We may also assign a "cookie" to your computer in some situations.
Like an IP address, a "cookie" is a kind of online identification tag that allows us to recognize your computer each time you visit AARP.org.
For example, the AARP Online Community, that is, those registered users of AARP.org who submit personal profiles, or participate in message boards, journals, chat rooms and user groups, uses cookies to recognize returning registered users of the site.
==========
We may also use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies to help us monitor the activity on our website.
A Web beacon is an image file contained in an advertisement or other content that indicates when the ad or the content has loaded on to a user’s screen.
We refer to cookies and Web beacons together here as “cookies.”
Unless you have already provided us with personal information on AARP.org or an affiliated linked website, cookies do not allow us to identify you by name, email address, or other personally identifiable information.
We use cookies primarily to identify return visitors and make your AARP.org experience more relevant and convenient.
