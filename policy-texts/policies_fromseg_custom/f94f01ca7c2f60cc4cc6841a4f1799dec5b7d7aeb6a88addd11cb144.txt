8.
PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO USERS THAT ARE CANDIDATES
The provisions of this Section 8 of the Agreement are specific to Users that use the Service as Candidates (including as Job Seekers).
If you are using the Service as a Candidate, then in the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 8 and the rest of the Agreement, the provisions of this Section 8 will control.
==========
A. Candidate Accounts
If you create a Candidate Account (whether to search or apply for a job posting as a “Job Seeker” or to complete the new hire process through ZipHire as a potential new employee or contractor), you must be permitted to legally work within your applicable jurisdiction.
If you are registering to be a Candidate, you may use your account only for yourself or individuals for whom you have legal authority to represent.
In addition to applying for a job posting as a “Job Seeker”, you can also browse the Service, receive job alerts from the Service regarding jobs that may be of interest to you (“Job Alerts”), and save a record of job listings you have found on the Service.
B. Job Applications
As a registered Job Seeker you will be able to submit job applications through the Service (“Job Applications”) for jobs that are listed on the Service (“Job Listings”).
You will have the ability to choose how to submit your Job Application through the Service using the options offered through the Service.
For example, you may submit your Job Application through the Service by (A) using the Service’s “1-Click Apply” feature, (B) using the Service’s “Apply Now” feature, or (C) applying through your Monster.com or LinkedIn.com accounts.
==========
If you elect to use the Service’s “1-Click Apply” feature, when you click on “1-Click Apply” the information that you have included as part of your User Profile, including your resume and contact information, will be sent to the Employer that posted the applicable Job Listing.
If you elect to use the Service’s “Apply Now” feature, you will either be required to provide your name, email address and phone number, and attach your resume (and, when you click the “Apply Now” button, this information will then be sent to the Employer that posted the applicable Job Listing), or the "Apply Now" button will redirect you to an external website where you will be able to apply to the Job Listing.
If you elect to apply through either your Monster.com or LinkedIn.com account, you will be asked to log-in to your Monster.com or LinkedIn.com account, and the profile, resume and other information that you have provided as part of your Monster.com or LinkedIn.com account will then be sent to the Employer that posted the applicable job.
==========
You can also submit a Job Application through your mobile device.
Please note that once you have submitted a Job Application through any feature of the Service, your resume and other applicable information will be shared with the Employer that posted the Job Listing.
If you elect to submit a Job Application to an Employer through the Service’s “1-Click Apply” feature the information you include in your User Profile will constitute the information that is included in your Job Application and provided to the applicable Employer.
You should therefore ensure that the information in your User Profile is complete and accurate, and only contains information you are comfortable sharing with Employers, prior to submitting a Job Application through the Service’s “1-Click Apply” feature.
If you submit a resume, you acknowledge that we may ‘parse’ the resume in order to create searchable text for an Employer.
The employer will also be able to see your resume in the form in which you submitted it to ZipRecruiter.
==========
C. Resume Database
In addition to submitting Job Applications through the Service, you will have the opportunity to, but will not be required to, elect to include your resume as part of the Service’s resume database (the “Resume Database”) at the time you register to use the Service.
If you do not elect to include your resume in the Resume Database at the time you register to use the Service, as a registered Job Seeker you may subsequently elect to include your resume in the Resume Database by adjusting the settings in your Job Seeker account.
We will not include your resume in the Resume Database unless you affirmatively elect to include your resume in the Resume Database.
==========
If you elect to include your resume in the Resume Database, Employers who have registered to access the Resume Database will be able to access and view your resume and the contact information you provide on your resume, including your name, email address, mailing address and phone number, as applicable.
Employers will be able to contact you directly using the information on your resume.
Please provide minimal personally identifiable information about yourself.
==========
You can opt-out of including your resume in the Resume Database at any time by adjusting the settings in your Job Seeker account and we will remove your resume from the Resume Database as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, if an Employer has accessed your resume through the Resume Database and copied or saved your resume prior to the date we receive your opt-out request, following the time we receive your opt-out request that Employer will continue to have access to your resume and all information you included in your resume as it was included in the Resume Database.
D. Interactions with Employers
You are solely responsible for your interactions with Employers that you contact, or that contact you, through the Service.
==========
Please note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, that may arise when dealing with strangers, including persons who may be acting under false pretenses.
You should therefore use caution with regard to the information you elect to share as part of your User Profile or a Job Application or resume that you provide through the Service.
Only list the contact information on your resume or Job Applications that you are comfortable disclosing to Employers and other Users of the Service.
==========
Although ZipRecruiter requests that Employers maintain the confidentiality of the Job Applications and resumes they receive through the Service, ZipRecruiter cannot and does not guarantee that the information you provide to Employers through the Service as part of a Job Application or resume will be held in confidence or properly secured by each applicable Employer.
In addition, ZipRecruiter takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Job Listing that any Employer posts or sends through the Service.
You agree that ZipRecruiter is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any Employer.
==========

A. Employer Accounts
If you create an Employer Account to post a job opening, we will make reasonable efforts to distribute your job posting to the third-party services indicated on the Service, as we may update them from time to time (“Distributors").
However, you acknowledge and accept that we have no control over any Distributor and therefore, we provide no guarantee that your job post will be accepted by a Distributor.
You accept that a Distributor may reject your job post for any reason, whether you are on any paid job posting plan or on a trial subscription, and even if you have paid for a “Premium Post”.
You agree that ZipRecruiter is not liable to you or any third party if your job post is rejected or not posted.
By posting your job, you give us permission to distribute your post to current and future Distributors.
You acknowledge and agree that ZipRecruiter cannot be responsible and disclaims all liability for Distributors, including without limitation their availability, operations, features and functionality.
==========
You are solely responsible for interviewing, performing background and reference checks on, verifying information provided by, and selecting an appropriate Candidate.
B. Authorized Users
As an Employer, you are responsible for all activity, acts or omissions by any of your personnel that create an Account to use the Services (“Authorized Users”).
Accounts may not be shared between different Employer personnel.
==========
Employer shall ensure that Authorized Users comply with this Agreement, and shall promptly notify ZipRecruiter of any suspected or alleged violation of this Agreement including any unauthorized use of any password or account or any other known or suspected breach of security.
Employer shall cooperate with ZipRecruiter with respect to: (i) investigation by ZipRecruiter of any suspected or alleged violation of this Agreement and (ii) any action by ZipRecruiter to enforce this Agreement.
ZipRecruiter may suspend or terminate an Authorized User’s access to the Services in the event that ZipRecruiter reasonably determines that such Authorized User has violated this Agreement or appears likely to do so.

AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
A. Binding Arbitration
This Section 17 is referred to in this Agreement as the “Agreement to Arbitrate".
Unless you opt-out pursuant to the opt-out procedures set forth below, you agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and ZipRecruiter or its affiliates, whether relating to the Service, this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), or otherwise (each a “Dispute”), shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
==========
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, each available at www.adr.org, or such other alternative dispute resolution body and arbitration rules that may be mutually agreed upon by you and ZipRecruiter.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by such rules.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
==========
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and ZipRecruiter may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
B. Restrictions
You and ZipRecruiter agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between ZipRecruiter and you individually.
To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

You and ZipRecruiter agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or ZipRecruiter intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.
D. 30 Day Right to Opt Out
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 17 above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to ZipRecruiter’s contact information listed at the bottom of this Agreement.
The notice must be sent to ZipRecruiter within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections.
