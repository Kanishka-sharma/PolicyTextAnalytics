                                                hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.
A cookie will typically 
                                                contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of 
                                                the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.
This helps 
                                                us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also 
                                                allows us to improve our site and services.

We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
==========
We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.
Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted 
                                                    from your hard drive at the end of a session.
You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that 
                                                    we do not control.
(For example, if you view a web page created by another user, 
                                                    there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)
Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the 
                                                browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.
==========
There are many different types and uses of cookies, but most can be classified 
                                                in a number of different ways.
First and Third Party Cookies – whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party 
                                                refers to the website or domain placing the cookie.
First party cookies in basic 
                                                terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user - the website displayed 
                                                in the URL window.
==========
Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain 
                                                other than the one being visited by the user.
If a user visits a website and a 
                                                separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third party 
                                                cookie.
Session Cookies – allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser 
                                                session.
They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a 
                                                user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site.
They could 
                                                also be used for security or to facilitate use of webmail.
==========
These session cookies 
                                                expire after a browser session and would not be stored long term.
Persistent Cookies – are stored on a users’ device in between browser sessions 
                                                which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some 
                                                cases across different websites) to be remembered.
Persistent cookies may be 
                                                used for a variety of purposes including remembering users’ preferences and 
                                                choices when using a site or to target advertising.
Persistent cookies are also 
                                                used to track visitor behaviour as they move around a site, this data is used to 
                                                try and understand what people do and don't like about a site.

This practice is 
                                                known as Web Analytics.
Analytics cookies are probably the most common form of 
                                                persistent cookies in use today.

Secure Cookies - Secure cookies are only transmitted via HTTPS - which you will 
                                                typically find in the checkout pages of online shopping sites.
This ensures that 
                                                any data in the cookie will be encrypted as it passes between the website and 
                                                the browser.
HTTP Only Cookies - When a cookie has an HTTP Only attribute set, the browser 
                                                will prevent any client script in the page (like JavaScript) from accessing the 
                                                contents of the cookie.
This protects it from cross-site-scripting (XSS) 
                                                attacks, where a malicious script tries to send the content of a cookie to a 
                                                third party website.
Disabling/enabling Cookies - You have the ability to accept or decline cookies 
                                                by modifying the settings in your browser.
However, you may not be able to use 
                                                all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.

Web Beacon - Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF.
We use pixels 
                                                tags or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising and 
                                                promotions.
==========
These tags collect anonymous (not personally identifiable) 
                                                information about which advertisements and promotions bring users to our 
                                                website.
With both cookie and tag technology, the information that we collect 
                                                and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not contain your 
                                                name, address, telephone number, or email address.
==========
Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic 
                                                image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or 
                                                in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web 
                                                site or sending the e-mail.
When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a 
                                                site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such 
                                                as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web 
                                                beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image 
                                                and previously set cookie values.
==========
Web beacons are typically used by a 
                                                third-party to monitor the activity of a site.
A Web beacon can be detected by 
                                                viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load 
                                                from a different server than the rest of the site.
Turning off the browser's 
                                                cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity.
The Web 
                                                beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique 
                                                information will not be recorded.

We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any 
                                                personally identifying information.
Children under 13 years of age are required 
                                                to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any 
                                                Personal Information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail address, and 
                                                phone number) over the Internet.
If a child has provided us with 
                                                personally-identifiable information without the consent of a parent or guardian, 
                                                the parent or guardian of that child should contact the Privacy Officer 
                                                immediately at 
                                                privacyofficer@subway.com.
We will use reasonable efforts to promptly delete 
                                                the child's information from our servers.

A Note to Parents/Guardians—Additional Information About Children’s 
                                                Privacy
  - (Top)


                                                At DAI, children’s privacy is important to us.
Therefore, we take additional 
                                                measures to help children protect their privacy while online including not 
                                                asking them to disclose more personally identifiable information than is 
                                                necessary for them to participate in an activity and encouraging them to use 
                                                non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names.
DAI is dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal 
                                                information we obtain from you with care and respect.
This Children's Privacy 
                                                Statement is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies 
                                                and principles with respect to children under the age of 13.
DAI recognizes the 
                                                need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit our website 
                                                at www.subway.com.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform 
                                                parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal 
                                                information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent 
                                                of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use 
                                                certain features of our website.
Also, when we use the term "parent", we mean to 
                                                include legal guardians.
Children can participate in many of our features without providing personally 
                                                identifiable information.
However, to enable their participation in certain of 
                                                our interactive features, we may ask children to provide us with personally 
                                                identifiable information.
The types of information we may request include first 
                                                name as well as the child’s and parent’s email addresses.
We use a child’s email 
                                                address to respond to a specific request to participate in an activity (e.g., 
                                                participate in a contest or sweepstakes, respond to their question, enable them 
                                                to subscribe to a newsletter).
We use parents’ e-mail addresses to obtain their 
                                                consent or notify them of their child's online activities and enable the parent 
                                                to unsubscribe the child from a newsletter or other similar activity.
We 
                                                do not share children's personally identifiable information with outside third 
                                                parties not bound by this Privacy Policy.
==========
Sometimes, we use agents or 
                                                contractors to help us conduct a contest or sweepstakes, send prizes to winners, 
                                                or provide customer service related to activities on the site.
In these cases, 
                                                we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to 
                                                use it only for the specific services they are performing.
==========
At 
                                                any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information 
                                                from their child and can request that any personal information we have collected 
                                                be deleted from our records.
We 
                                                will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we 
                                                intend to collect, use, and/or share their child’s personal information.
Please 
                                                note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to 
                                                provide us a current email address.
If you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have 
                                                collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request 
                                                that there be no further collection or use of your child's information, or if 
                                                you have questions about these information practices, you may contact our

We require our affiliates within the SUBWAY® Group and their Development Agents 
                                                to respect DAI’s privacy practices and not use your personal information for 
                                                purposes other than to carry out our instructions.
By applying to become a SUBWAY® franchisee, a prospective 
                                                franchisee consents to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal 
                                                Information in accordance with the following terms and conditions.
We collect 
                                                and use Personal Information in order to assist a prospective franchisee in 
                                                applying to become a SUBWAY® restaurant franchisee and to assist our affiliates 
                                                within the SUBWAY® Group in selecting franchisee candidates.
==========
Personal Information collected from prospective franchisees 
                                                include, but is not limited to: name, address, telephone number, facsimile

                                                financial statement, litigation history, and taxpayer identification number.
Failure to provide requested Personal Information may negatively impact a 
                                                prospective franchisee’s ability to become a franchisee.
Once a prospective 
                                                SUBWAY® restaurant franchisee becomes a franchisee, they may then reference 
                                                themselves by their Franchise Agreement Number.
In order to better service 
                                                franchisees, a franchisee’s Personal Information may be shared between DAI and 
                                                its affiliates within the SUBWAY® Group, pursuant to the service contracts 
                                                between them.
In order to effectively implement the SUBWAY® Gift Card 
                                                Program, and to provide purchasing services to members, a franchisee’s Personal 
                                                Information may be shared with an independent purchasing cooperative or other 
                                                independent third party.
The Personal Information shared with the independent 
                                                purchasing cooperative shall include, but will not be limited to: name, address, 
                                                credit card information, and other related information necessary for billing 
                                                purposes, such as a mailing address for credit card validation, and bank account 
                                                information, you provided to DAI to establish your pre-authorized account for 
                                                the payment of royalties, advertising fees, and other charges.
Subject to a 
                                                franchisee’s agreement with the independent purchasing cooperative, the 
                                                independent purchasing cooperative may bill a franchisee’s bank account for fees 
                                                and other costs associated with the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program.
If a franchisee 
                                                does not wish to disclose this information, they must notify the Privacy Officer 
                                                in writing as described in the section titled “Contact Information” below.

                                                prospective franchisee in their territory should be granted a franchise.

The 
                                                Development Agent may use this information to: address a franchisee’s concerns

                                                any other inquiry which may require a response.
Franchisee Personal Information

Finally, upon becoming a SUBWAY® franchisee you consent to 
                                                DAI disclosing former or past franchisee contact information including Personal

                                                Development Agent candidates and for the purpose of operating a development 
                                                territory.
Personal Information collected includes, but is not limited to: name, home
