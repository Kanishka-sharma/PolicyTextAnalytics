Advertising, Marketing & Monetization

            IMVU partners with third party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks (collectively, “External Ad Partners”) for advertising and monetization purposes, as well as marketing affiliates for specific offers (“Offerwall Providers”).
External Ad Partners, and in some cases Offerwall Providers, use cookies, beacons, tags, tracking pixels, and similar tracking technologies to collect certain Device and Usage Information, including IP address and device ID.
With this Device and Usage Information and, in some cases, information about your visits to other websites and services, External Ad Partners provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you, often referred to as behaviorally-targeted or re-targeted advertisements.
Their use of your personal information will be governed by the terms of their privacy policies, and their privacy policies may explain how you can opt-out of certain tracking by their advertisements.
If you elect to participate in the “Free Credits” or “Earn Credits” functionality and you opt in, note that relevant Offerwall Providers may also track performance and use data relating to the content as well as how you use the Services.
For California residents, please click here for more information.
What does this mean?
When you click on a link to an External Ad Partners on our Services, that External Ad Partner will drop a cookie (or similar tracking technologies) to capture and collect Device and Usage Information, so that it can track your activity on the Services, unless you are in the EEA and have not opted in or have blocked cookies as described below.
==========
This information may be combined with other information from other sources and be used to deliver targeted advertising.
For more information about interest-based advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising website.
To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please use this link to download the version of AppChoices for your device.
Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations.
You may also continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.
==========
You may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system.
For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
==========
You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.
Please visit our 
            Cookie Notice

Legal Obligations and Security
IMVU may preserve or disclose your personal information in limited circumstances (other than as set forth in this Privacy Notice), including: (i) with your consent; (ii) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a valid subpoena, warrant, or other judicial or administrative order (as further explained below); (iii) to protect the safety of any person; (iv) to protect the safety or security of our Services or to prevent spam, abuse, or other malicious activity of actors with respect to the Services; or (v) to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use the Services.

However, if we receive information that provides us with a good faith belief that there is an exigent emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, we may provide information to law enforcement trying to prevent or mitigate the danger (if we have it), which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
==========
Payment Processing
We use third party, PCI-compliant payment processors, which collect payment information on our behalf in order to complete transactions.
While we receive a payment confirmation when a user makes a purchase, we do not have access to, and are unable to process, your credit card information.

Third-Party Sign-In
You may register to join or log in to the Services directly or by using a third-party platform sign-in such as Apple Sign-in or Facebook Connect.
IMVU only uses these third-party platforms for the purpose of authenticating users and does not pass any personal information on to the third-party platform.
If you choose to sign in to the Services through a third-party platform, the third-party platform may collect personal information about you and your activity, depending on how you have adjusted your privacy settings with that third-party platform.
Your use of third-party sign-in for authentication purposes is subject to the privacy policies of those platforms.
==========

The information collected on these third-party sites is not covered by our Privacy Notice.
For information on how third-party offer sites collect and use your information in exchange for credits, please refer to their respective privacy policies and their policies on addressing financial incentives for California residents.
These third-party sites share with us your customer identification number once the offer has been completed so that we may match the number to your avatar in order to credit your account with the credits you have earned from the third-party sites for completing their offer(s).
==========
Please note that some pages may have the look and feel of our Services (i.e., 
            www.imvu.com.
            )
, however these pages are served by a third party and our Privacy Notice does not apply to the information collected on these co-branded sites.
You should read the privacy policy or statement of our co-branded partner on the co-branded site.
Do Not Track
IMVU does not track individuals across multiple platforms.
==========
Protecting Your Personal Information
No method of transmission over the Internet (or method of electronic storage) is 100% secure, however we take steps that are reasonably necessary to securely provide our Services.
We have put in place reasonably appropriate security measures designed to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed.
==========
We limit access to personal data only to those employees, agents, contractors, and the third parties who have a business need-to-know.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach.
If required, we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach.
==========
We also require those parties to whom we transfer your personal information to provide acceptable standards of security.
International Transfers
We are located in the United States, and the personal information that we collect is stored on servers located in the United States.
This means that your personal information will be collected, processed, and stored in the United States, which may have data protection laws that are different from (and sometimes less protective than) the laws of your country or region, such as the GDPR.
By sending us personal information, you agree and consent to the processing of your personal information in the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other countries (particularly the European Union), and to the processing of that information by us on servers located in the United States, as described in this Privacy Notice.
==========
We have implemented safeguards designed to ensure that the personal information we process remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice, including when processed internationally or by our third party service providers and partners.
The safeguards we may take in our discretion include, for instance, entering into specific agreements in connection with any onward transfers of personal information.
We may implement other mechanisms and take similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners.

Categories of Recipients of Personal Data

            The categories of recipients of Personal Data with whom we may share your Personal Data are listed in 
            Disclosure of Your Personal Information.
above.
==========
Purpose of the Processing and Legal Bases
IMVU processes your personal information for a number of different purposes.
Some are essential for us to provide the Services you use or to fulfill our legal obligations, some help us run the Services efficiently and effectively, and some enable us to provide you with more relevant and personalized offers and information.
In all cases we must have a reason and a legal ground for processing your personal information.
Some of the most common legal grounds we rely on are briefly explained below.
==========
Performance of a Contract:
                We may process your personal data for the purpose of performing under the terms of a contract to which you are a party - in other words, your ability to use the Services.
For instance, if you purchase virtual items on the Services, we will process your data in order to carry out the payment transaction.
Legitimate Interests
                We may process personal data where it is necessary for our legitimate business interests, but only to the extent that they are not outweighed by your own interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
==========
We generally rely on legitimate interests to provide and maintain Services that work well and securely, to carry out fraud prevention, and to generally improve the Services.
When we rely on this legal basis, if required, we will carry out a legitimate interest assessment to ensure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws.
==========
Consent
                IMVU will rely on consent where it is required, such as when we are asking you to confirm your marketing preferences.
When we rely on consent, you will be asked to confirm that you give your permission to IMVU to process your personal data.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time if you no longer want to be part of the IMVU processing activity where your consent was sought.
Legal Obligation
                IMVU will on occasion be under a legal obligation to obtain and disclose your personal data or may cooperate in a legal or governmental investigation.
Where possible, we will notify you when processing your data due to a legal obligation; however, this may not always be possible.
IMVU may determine that it needs to provide your data in order to prevent criminal activity or help to detect criminal activity; in which case, we may share information with law enforcement without notifying you.
It is essential that IMVU complies with its legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements, so if you object to this processing, IMVU will not be able to provide its Services to you.
==========
The following breakdown illustrates in more detail how the above legal bases for processing apply to our primary purposes for processing different types of personal data.
Please note that, with respect to legal bases, we only rely on one basis for each specific processing activity, but for purposes of this following breakdown, we may list more than one, which will then depend on the specific type of processing and circumstances.
We have broken each processing activity by legal bases and categories of personal data processed:

How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?
==========
We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods: the amount, nature and sensitivity of your information, the reasons for which we collect and process your personal data, the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you with access to our Services, and applicable legal requirements.
We will retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements), when we are unable to reasonably verify your identity, or as may otherwise be required under GDPR.
==========
Additionally, we cannot delete information when it is needed for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (also known as a “litigation hold”).
In this case, the information must be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims.
When we have no ongoing business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If you have questions about, or need further information concerning, our data retention periods, please send an email at 
            privacy@imvu.com.
==========
Staying in Control of Your Information: Your Rights

If the GDPR applies to you because you are in the EEA,
             you have certain rights in relation to your Personal Data:
        

The right to be informed – our obligation to inform you that we process your Personal Data (and that is what we are doing in this Privacy Notice)
The right of access – your right to request a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you (also known as a ‘data subject access request’)
The right to rectification – your right to request that we correct Personal Data about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your Account Settings)
The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’) – under certain circumstances, you may ask us to delete the Personal Data we have about you (unless there is an overriding legal reason we need to keep it)
The right to restrict processing – your right, under certain circumstances, to ask us to suspend our processing of your Personal Data
The right to data portability – your right to ask us for a copy of your Personal Data in a common format (for example, a .
csv file)
The right to object – your right to object to us processing your Personal Data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing)
Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling – our obligation to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making


            These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them.
==========
If you are located in the EEA and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us (see 
            How To Contact Us About Privacy).
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.
==========
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request under those circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Note that if we are unable to reasonably confirm your identity, we will not be able to honor certain requests.
==========
We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law.
==========
In addition, if you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you.
If you do so, we will promptly update our databases, and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing our Services.
==========
Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence.
We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please contact us directly first.

==========
Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights

            You have the right to request that IMVU disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
Once we receive your request 
            and verify your identity 
(see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights)
            , we will disclose such information to you.
Deletion Request Rights

            You have the right to request that IMVU delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

Exercising Your Consumer Rights
Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable Consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable Consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
An authorized agent is a natural person or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State that a Consumer has authorized to act on his or her behalf.
==========
When a Consumer uses an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete, IMVU may require that the Consumer provide the authorized agent written permission to do so and verify his or her own identity directly with IMVU, unless the Consumer has provided the authorized agent with a valid power of attorney.
IMVU may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized by the Consumer to act on his or her behalf.
==========
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable Consumer request to us by either:
You may only make a verifiable Consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable Consumer request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
==========
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable Consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
==========
Please note that the methods for verification are set forth in the CCPA, which also requires us to consider a number of factors, such as the type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information or the risk of harm posed by unauthorized access or deletion, on a case-by-case basis.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable Consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable Consumer request within 45 days of its receipt, or as otherwise required by the CCPA.
==========
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of the verifiable Consumer’s request.
If applicable, in our response, we will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request.
==========
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable Consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination and Notice of Financial Incentives
We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.
==========
Please note that to use our Services, we do require the collection of your personal information - for example, to sign you up or to complete a paid transaction.
While you may request to delete your personal information under CCPA, such deletions may affect IMVU’s ability to offer the Services.
In addition, on our Services, our Offerwall Providers may offer you financial incentives, including, in some cases, in the form of IMVU credits, that are directly related to the value provided to the Offerwall Providers by the personal information for the collection, sale, retention, and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA.
==========
Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt in to the program and you can opt out of each program by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms as provided by the offer wall partner.
The financial incentive programs and their terms are located on the offer wall or at the offer wall partner’s site when you click on an offer to participate in an offer.
Our Offerwall Providers determine what financial incentives and credits are provided to you, independently of IMVU, and as such are responsible for (a) determining the value of your personal information, (b) providing you with a proper notice of financial incentive under the CCPA, if applicable to them, as well as the ability to opt-in and subsequently opt-out, and (c) ensuring that they do not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notices on the program descriptions and terms linked to the above so check them regularly.
==========

IMVU Cookie Notice
Last updated as of: November 11, 2020
This Cookie Notice explains how we use cookies in connection with the Services, and your related choices.
Capitalized terms used in this Cookie Notice but not defined herein will have the meanings given to them in IMVU’s Privacy Notice.
==========
If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them by following the instructions in this Cookie Notice - for instance, by clicking the Cookie Settings link (from our cookie banner and also available from the 
            button below
            ) if you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or by changing your browser settings so that cookies on the Services cannot be placed on your computer or mobile device.
What Are Cookies?
Like most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve our Services.
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience.
They can also help to ensure that advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
When you visit, access or use the Services, we may by means of cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and/or similar technologies automatically collect technical information, including Device and Usage Information and other similar technical information.
==========
A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs.
With respect to lifespan, a cookie is either a 
            session cookie
            , which is erased when the user closes the browser, or a 
            persistent cookie
            , which remains on the user’s computer/device for a pre-defined period of time.
As to the domain to which a cookie belongs, it is either a 
            first-party cookie, which is set by IMVU, or a 
            third-party cookie
             stored by a different domain
        
We use both session and persistent cookies, and enable first and third-party cookies.
IMVU tracks users' use of the Services, but does not track users across third party websites.
==========
Below is a more detailed description of how and why we use cookies.
How and Why do We Use Cookies?
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the Services to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
==========
They are usually only set in response to actions made by you, which amount to a request for access to our Services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.
You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but, if you do, some parts of the Services will not work.
Performance Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Services.
They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and to see how visitors navigate the Services.
==========
Performance cookies are used to help us with our analytics, including to:


                Compile statistics and analytics about your use of, and interaction with the Services, including details about how and where our Services are accessed, how often you visit or use the Services, the date and time of your visits, your actions on the Services, and information regarding in-game activities, and other similar traffic, usage, and trend data 
                (see Device and Usage Information above).
These analytic tools allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device and gain insights about how mobile software is used in order to improve your experience
            
Gather important functionality, testing, and performance data about our Services, including performance data related to the Services, such as networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage, among other relevant data
Moderate user behavior on the Services, such as protecting against payment fraud and other inappropriate activities.
==========
We use third-party tools and technologies to help us gather this information.
For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data with technologies such as tracking pixels.
==========
Targeting Cookies
These cookies may be set on our Services by our External Ad Partners for advertising purposes.
They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites.
==========
What does this mean?
When you click on a link to an External Ad Partners on our Services, that External Partner will drop a cookie (or similar tracking technologies) to capture and collect Device and Usage Information, so that it can track your activity on the Services, unless you are a user in the EEA and have not opted in, or have blocked cookies as described in the Privacy Notice.
==========
This information may be combined with other information from other sources and be used to deliver targeted advertising.
Your Choices
Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set.
Some browser manufacturers provide comprehensive help relating to cookie management in their products.
