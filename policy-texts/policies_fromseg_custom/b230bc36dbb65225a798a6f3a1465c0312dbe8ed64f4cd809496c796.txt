SERVICE.
5.1
Service    Distinctions.
Our service may be subject to different regulatory treatment than traditional    voice telecommunications service.
==========
This treatment may limit or otherwise    affect your rights of redress before regulatory agencies.
Our service    requires high speed broadband or, for certain mobile applications, a WIFI or    other data connection (e.g. 3G/4G) which we do not provide.
Certain of our    other services may be used with devices such as wireless telephones, mobile    telephones, smartphones, PDA's, tablets or pads which we may or may not    provide.
Events beyond our control may affect our service, such as power    outages, fluctuations in the Internet, your underlying ISP or broadband    service, system maintenance or acts of God.
We will act in good faith using    commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions to your use of and    access to our service.
==========
5.2
Residential Use of    Service and Device.
Vonage's residential and mobile unlimited service plans and features are    only for normal    residential or personal, non-commercial use.
This means that only the account    holder, residential family members, and those Extensions™ phone number(s) registered    with Vonage by the account holder may use Vonage's residential and mobile    unlimited service plans.
==========
Residential    family members refer to those members of your immediate family who reside    in your personal residence - e.g., spouse, domestic partner, parents and/or children.
If your residential service plan    allows you to extend the service or feature(s) to another residential or    mobile number, all use under that service plan is aggregated and must conform    to normal residential or personal, non-commercial use.
Some Vonage plans allow for the use    of additional devices (such as personal computers, mobile phones, Extensions™    phone number(s) registered with Vonage or other Vonage equipment) outside the    residence as part of that service plan.
==========
If you subscribe to a service plan which permits use of more than one device    with the same voice line, your    usage will be aggregated and assessed in accordance with our Reasonable Use Policy.
Vonage's mobile unlimited service    plans and features are for normal, personal non-commercial use and are device    specific.
5.3
Small Business    Plans.
a.
==========
If you subscribe to any of Vonage's small business    plans, including one of our Small Office Home Office ("SoHo") plans, we    provide service, features and certain    equipment to you solely    for use as a small business user or domestic business traveler.
Some Vonage plans allow for the use    of additional devices (such as personal computers, mobile phones or other    Vonage equipment) as part of these service plans.
If you subscribe to a    service plan which permits use of more than one device with the same voice    line, your usage will be aggregated and assessed in accordance with our    Reasonable Use Policy.
b.
The following uses are not considered small business    uses and are not permitted under small business plans: autodialing;    continuous or extensive call-forwarding or conferencing; inbound/outbound centralized or distributed call    center activity; telemarketing of any kind (including,    but not limited to, charitable or political solicitation or polling); fax or    voicemail broadcasting; and fax or voicemail blasting.
==========
See  Section 10 for more details.
Certain business plans may require    you to be responsible for supplying, operating, and supporting the standard    SIP-based Customer Premise Equipment for    use with the service.
As the subscriber and operator or administrator of this    equipment, you are responsible for maintaining the security of the equipment,    including but not limited to the physical and network security elements of    your equipment, and any    and all charges related thereto.
c.
Some business plans may not be    eligible for certain promotional offers.
==========
5.4
Inconsistent with    Normal Use.
If you use the service, any feature and/or any device (including, but not limited to,    your personal computer(s), mobile phone(s) or Vonage equipment) in a way that is inconsistent with    the normal use for your service, feature or plan, you will be required, at    Vonage's sole discretion, to (a)    pay the rates for the    service, feature or plan that would apply to the way you used the service,    feature or device, (b)    change to a more appropriate plan or (c)    terminate the plan.
For example, if you subscribe to one of our residential    service plans, and your aggregate    usage is inconsistent    with normal residential or    personal use, you may    thereafter be required to pay our applicable, higher rates for service for    all periods in which your use of our service or the device was inconsistent    with normal residential use.
==========
Unlimited voice services are provided primarily    for continuous live dialogue between two individuals.
Lack of    continuous dialogue activity, unusual calling patterns, excessive conferencing or    call forwarding, excessive numbers    dialed and/or consistent    excessive usage (which may also apply to features such as Directory    Assistance) will be considered indicators that your use    may be inconsistent with normal use    by other Vonage customers aggregating their usage under a similar service    plan, or that impermissible    use as set forth in Section 10 and/or in the Reasonable Use Policy    may be occurring and    may trigger an account review or further action by us.
A non-exhaustive list of examples of    uses of our service that are generally considered to be inconsistent with normal residential use,    include, but are not limited to, use:

by or for others who do not         live with you 
by others who are not         registered Vonage Extensions users 
operating a business, even if         operating from the residence 
at a multi-residential address         for more than one single residence 

A non exhaustive list of examples of    uses of our service that are generally considered to be inconsistent with    either residential or commercial use, include, but are not limited to, use:

operating any other enterprise,         including not-for-profit or governmental 
operating a call center 
resale to others 
auto-dialing or fax/voice         blasts 
telemarketing 
without live dialogue,         including as a monitor, intercom or for transcription 

Vonage evaluates customer usage in    comparison to similarly situated customers, e.g., residential use under    residential service plans or small business use under small business service    plans.
For example, over ninety five per cent (95%) of Vonage's residential    unlimited calling plan customers use less than three thousand (3000) minutes    per month and do not have any unusual calling patterns.
We may conclude that    a customer's aggregate usage is outside of normal use if it exceeds 3000    minutes per month IN COMBINATION with one or more of the following,    including, but not limited to, excessive: 

number of unique numbers called 
call lengths 
frequency of call         forwarding/transferring 
conference calling 
short duration calls 
calls made during business         hours 

Vonage may take appropriate steps to    enforce these Terms of Service and    our Reasonable Use Policy.
==========
We    reserve the right to review your account and take further action if account    usage is beyond normal standards, impermissible or detrimental to other customers'    ability to use the service or adversely affects our operations.
We may assess    abnormal usage based on    comparisons to the usage patterns and levels of our other customers.
If we determine    that you are engaging in abnormal or impermissible usage, we will use    commercially reasonable efforts to inform you and provide you with the    opportunity to correct the improper usage.
==========
If you fail to correct usage activity to conform    to normal use, we may    exercise our right to    transfer your service to a more    appropriate plan,    charge applicable rates    or suspend or terminate    your service.
You    acknowledge that if your service is terminated under this provision, you are    subject to all applicable fees and taxes at the time your service is    terminated.
Vonage's right to terminate your account under Section 6.5(b) (with or for no reason) is not limited by this provision.
==========
Commercial,         not-for profit, governmental use or other similar use 
The use of the service at a multi-residential address for         more than one single residence; or 
The use of the service by others who do not reside in your         personal residence primarily by reason of its unlimited feature
