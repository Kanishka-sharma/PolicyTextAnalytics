Part I. General information
Our commitment to privacy
Sift Science, Inc. (“Sift”) provides digital trust products and services (the "Sift Service") to online businesses (our “Customers”) to help them detect and address fraud and other malicious behavior on their digital properties.
This Sift Service Privacy Notice ("Notice") explains how we collect, share and use personal information in the context of the Sift Service.
In using our service, Customers provide Sift with information about their users' activities for fraud analysis.
That information may include your personal information.
This Notice provides an explanation of the Sift Service and how you can exercise your privacy rights with respect to your personal information.
This Notice does not describe our collection and use of personal information when visitors access our website or in connection with our sales and marketing efforts.
For that information, please see our Site Privacy Notice.
Introduction to Sift Service
The Sift Service begins when Customers provide us with data and information about their users ("Users") and their interactions with the applicable Customer Site (“Service Data”).
Customers provide that Service Data through multiple technologies including cookies, web beacons, Javascript code and other data collection technologies, our REST Application Programming Interfaces and the Sift Service management console, as further described in Part II below.
We take the Service Data and use our proprietary analytics algorithms to convert it into a holistic and relative fraud score concerning the specified activity on the Customer Site (e.g. purchase transactions, public profile creation or postings, etc.).
This assists in identifying and preventing fraudulent activity on the applicable Customer Site.
Our Customers then decide what action to take, or not to take, based on the analysis Sift provides to them.
For example, they may choose to block a transaction if they believe there is a high risk of it being a fraudulent transaction.
Customers also provide us with ongoing feedback on the accuracy of our service results by reviewing transactions and activity for fraud.

Part II.
What the service collects and how we use it
Service Data that our Customers provide to us
Our Customers decide the types / format of Service Data they wish to send to Sift for analysis using the Sift Service.
We encourage Customers to work closely with the Sift solutions and support teams to assess the utility of the specific Service Data they send to us.
==========
Our goal is to help Customers assess whether certain activity is problematic, for example, helping to assess the likelihood that payment information has been stolen or that a User’s identity is false.
Specifically, Customers may send Sift personal information provided by Users, such as email addresses, billing addresses, shipping addresses, user login name, and telephone numbers.
Customers may send us information about specific User behavior on their Customer Sites, including the IP address of the device used, the pages navigated by the User, time of login/logout, items viewed, added to cart or purchased.
Customers may send data points about the form of payment, such as order amount, payment method, partial credit card numbers, and order status.
In addition, Customers may provide us with information about commentary that Users leave on their Customer Sites (e.g. forum posts and product reviews).
==========
This information helps Sift catch inappropriate content so that our Customers can operate cleaner services.
Customers may also place JavaScript code issued by Sift (“Sift JS Snippet”) onto their Customer Sites in order to enable us to collect unique device identifiers, including device metadata, from Users automatically.
The Sift JS Snippet collects information to uniquely identify the device the User is using.
From time to time, we may alter our device fingerprinting technology to improve its effectiveness at identifying a device.
==========
Similarly, in connection with their mobile applications, Customers may integrate with Sift-provided SDKs to help prevent fraud that may occur through their applications.
The SDKs may enable Sift to collect more precise information about the user's location, such as GPS (if the location settings allow it) and IP address.
Additionally, the SDK may collect phone-related metadata (e.g. battery level, device properties, carrier name, motion and proximity information) and unique device identifiers.
==========
Use of Service Data
Sift uses the Service Data for the limited purpose of providing fraud detection and prevention services to Customers of the Sift Service.
Sift does not receive or process Service Data for any other purpose.
The security of all of the Service Data we receive is protected by Sift as further described below.
Part III.
==========
Customer information we collect and how we use it
Information we collect about our Customer's employees and agents (the “Customer Information”) and how we use it
We will collect information about each Customer when they register for the Sift Service, such as company name, URL, fraud-related information, and company size.
We also collect personal information of those individuals that represent Customer in connection with the use of the Sift Service, such as full name, email address, phone number.
We will use that information for correspondence concerning Customer’s use of the Sift Service, for example, to arrange billing and to provide customer support.
If the Customer pays buy credit card, our payment processor will collect that information (Sift does not store full credit card data).
We may also use the information individuals provide to us for our marketing purposes.
Any recipients of marketing information will always be able to opt-out of receiving marketing information at any time (see the "Unsubscribe from Our Mailing List" section below).
==========
We will still communicate with applicable Customer team members regarding such things as product functionality, security updates, support or other service related reasons.
We also use Customer Information to analyze Customers' use of the Sift Service for business analytics and to maintain, develop and improve the Sift Service.
Part IV.

Sift requires that any information disclosed to a provider is used only to provide services to Sift and only as allowed by applicable law.
Data enrichment: We may share minimal Service Data (e.g. email addresses) with select third-party service providers for data enrichment purposes.
Enriching data allows us to provide a richer subset of data from which to make more informed fraud risk assessments.
==========

Prior to sharing data with any data enrichment provider, Sift assesses the provider’s security controls to ensure the data is adequately protected.
