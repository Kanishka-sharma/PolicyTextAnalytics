How to extract your Advertising ID?
For Android Devices
Although the Android ID was used historically for mobile ad tracking, as of August 1st, 2014 Google has required all new app releases to utilize the Android Advertising Identifier.
To find your Android Advertising Identifier, open the Google Settings app on your Android device and click on “Ads.”
Your Advertising Identifier will be listed at the bottom of the screen.
==========
For iOS Devices 
At present, the advertising ID (also known as IDFA) on iOS devices is hidden from users by Apple by default.
It can only be extracted using third-party apps such as My Device IDFA by AppsFlyer.
Resetting your Device ID
It should be noted that by resetting the IDFA or the Android Advertising Identifier may invalidate systems designed to respect your choices in advertising and may require you to submit any requests or forms again.
Also, if your Device ID is shown as a string of only zeroes, your device is already set to limit ad tracking by default.
