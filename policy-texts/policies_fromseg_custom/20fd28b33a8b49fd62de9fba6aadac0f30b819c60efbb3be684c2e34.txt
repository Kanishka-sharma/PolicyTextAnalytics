Audible.com knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.
This notice describes our privacy policy.

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Audible.com.
==========
Here are the types of information we gather

Information You Give Us:   We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.
Click here  to see examples of what we collect.
You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with you.
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.
==========
For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Audible.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Audible.com on other Web sites.
Click here  to see examples of the information we receive.
E-mail Communications:  To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Audible.com if your computer supports such capabilities.
==========
We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Communication Preferences.
Information from Other Sources:  We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

==========
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to store items in your Shopping Cart between visits.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.
However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Audible.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
==========
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.
We share customer information only as described below and with our parent corporation Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries it controls.
Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, fulfilling orders, and providing customer service.
They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
==========
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units.
In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
Also, in the event that Audible, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
==========
Protection of Audible.com and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Audible.com, our users, or others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
==========
We work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.
Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.
Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
==========
Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites.
We will not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.
These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, may use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to your browser.
They may automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
==========
We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Notice.
Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.
In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.
==========
Audible.com may also display personalized third-party advertising based on personal information about customers, such as purchases on Audible.com.
Click here  for more information about the personal information that we gather.
Although Audible.com will not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in the northeastern United States who bought or browsed for audio books about vampires).
Audible.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Audible.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
Click here  to see some examples, the list of which will change as our Web site evolves.
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Audible.com features as special sales and promotions, Customer Reviews or Recommendations.
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the "Which Information Can I Access?"
section.
When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your   Communication Preferences.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
