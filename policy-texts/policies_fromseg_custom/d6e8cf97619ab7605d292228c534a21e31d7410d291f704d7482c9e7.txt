Note for California Residents:This Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement describes how we process your Personal Information and your rights and choices over our processing.
In addition, Section X contains specific details related to your rights under California law, including your right to opt out of “sales” of Personal Information.
==========
This Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement ("Privacy Policy") explains how Condé Nast processes Personal Information in relation to the Service.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, apps, destinations, or other offerings that we do not own or control, even if they are linked to from the Service.
All capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy that are not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the Glossary.
==========
You can access this Privacy Policy any time in the footer of the Service's home page, via the menu button/hamburger icon or on the Service description screen, or as otherwise indicated depending on the Service you are using.
By purchasing a Product , registering for any aspect of the Service, or otherwise accessing, visiting or using the Service, you acknowledge your understanding of this Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree with the contents of this Privacy Policy, you should not access, visit and/or use the Service, or request or receive a Product.
We advise that you print or retain a digital copy of this Privacy Policy for future reference.
==========
In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please also review our User Agreement and any other terms and conditions that may be posted elsewhere in the Service or otherwise communicated to our users, because the User Agreement and all such terms and conditions are also part of the Agreement between you and us.
This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, so check back often.
==========
So that you are aware changes have been made, we will adjust the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this document.
If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will also post on the Service a notice that a change was made.
Continued access, visitation and/or use of the Service by you, or continued receipt of a Product, will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.
Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we may collect, obtain or otherwise acquire the following types of Personal Information about you, and we make and retain inferences drawn from such information:
1.
Identifiers, such as your name, signature, postal address, zip code, email address, telephone number, unique online identifier, IP address, User ID, and Device ID.
2.
Certain characteristics protected by applicable law, such as gender, marital status, nationality, and country of origin.
3.
Commercial information, such as purchase history.
4.
Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as website or app activity data, call logs, text messages, and emails.
5.
Geolocation data, such as the physical location of your Device.
6.
Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information, such as voice recordings, video recordings, physical characteristics or description, and photos.
7.
Professional or employment-related information, such as occupation, employment history and record, and resume.
8.
Education information such as academic record.
9.
==========
While we generally do not obtain other Personal Information that is often considered "sensitive," such as biometric information (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition images), financial account information (e.g., bank account, credit, debit or other payment card numbers or other financial information), government issued identification numbers (e.g., social security number, drivers' license number, passport number, or state identification card number), insurance policy number, or medical, health or insurance related information, we may do so when such Personal Information is necessary to offer you certain Services.
Nothing in this Privacy Policy addresses, or should be read to limit or restrict, how we collect, use or process anonymous, de-identified, or aggregate information.
A.
==========
How OBA Works.
We and our Service Providers, as well as Third Party Businesses, use Tracking Technologies on the Service for purposes of "online behavioral advertising" (OBA).
OBA allows the serving of advertisements tailored to perceived interests inferred by your browsing on the Service and on other sites, applications, destinations, and services, using the same or a different Device.
To enable OBA, we (and our Service Providers on our behalf), as well as Third Party Businesses, independently use Tracking Technologies to collect certain information, some of which may be deemed Personal Information, including for example the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier, online identifier) and geographic location of your Device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, Content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data.
The use of Tracking Technologies by Third Party Businesses is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy, and we have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith.
==========
B. Opt-Out of OBA.
If you do not want OBA, you may be able to opt-out by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/, http://www.networkadvertising.org/, http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ and/or by clicking the "Ad Choices" icon that appears in advertising served through OBA.
==========
Please note that the option to opt-out applies only to tracking by Third Party Businesses across this Service and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, and not tracking among pages within the Service itself.
This opt-out option also only applies to cookie-based OBA.
To opt-out of OBA that uses other Tracking Technologies, contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email or as described at the end of this document.
==========
Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland and the United Kingdom have additional options as described below in Section XI(B) to exercise choices with respect to OBA.
Residents of California have additional options as described below in Section X(A)(2) to exercise choice with respect to OBA.
==========
Your Personal Information may be processed, transferred to, and maintained on, servers and databases located outside of the jurisdiction in which you are based and where the privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction.
We have put in place appropriate safeguards (such as contractual commitments) in accordance with applicable legal requirements to ensure that your data is adequately protected.
For more information on the appropriate safeguards in place, please contact us at the details below.
==========
A. Consumer Privacy.
The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal.
Civ.
Code § 1798.100 et.
==========
seq. ("CCPA"), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described in this Section X(A).
California residents may exercise the following rights by completing this Privacy Webform or by calling 1-888-914-9661 and using PIN 867 610:
Know the ways in which we collect, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information;
Know the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold;
Request the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions; and
Not to be unlawfully discriminated against for exercising these rights.
==========
We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request to know or delete.
For example, we may seek to establish your identity to a reasonable or a reasonably high degree of certainty by matching information that you submit alongside your request with information that we have on our records.
We may ask for supplemental information as needed to establish your identity.
==========
California residents also have the right to opt-out of the "sale" of their Personal Information.
We put sale in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as sales, even if no money changes hands, such as when cookies and other Tracking Technologies are shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating and/or adding to profiles about individuals for OBA.
California residents can exercise this right by doing both of the following:
to opt-out of "sales" that occur on the Service through cookies and other Tracking Technologies, follow the instructions in the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link, which can generally be found in the Service's footer (if a website) or settings/about menu (if an application).
==========
You may need to flip a toggle or take other action as described in those instructions.
Toggle settings are generally browser-, Service-, and Device-specific and may reset if cookies are cleared.
==========
If you have any questions or need assistance exercising your rights, please contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email or as described at the end of this document.
NOTE: If you accessed this Privacy Policy from a Service other than condenast.com (such as, for example, vogue.com or The New Yorker application), you must first return to that Service and follow the instructions found in that Service's "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link.
==========
to opt-out of "sales" in contexts other than Tracking Technologies, fill out this Privacy Webform or call 1-888-914-9661 and use PIN 867 610.
Authorized agents seeking to submit requests on behalf of California residents and parents or guardians seeking to submit requests on behalf of their minors who are residents of California can submit such requests by using the forms above, by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email (or as described at the end of this document) or by calling 1-888-914-9661 and using PIN 867 610.
We may ask California residents to verify their identity and to confirm that they authorized the requestor to act on their behalf.
==========
Certain of our Services involve the "sales" of Personal Information of California residents over 12 years of age and under 16 years of age.
Where we have actual knowledge that a California resident is older than 12 and younger than 16, we will request affirmative authorization from the minor before selling the minor's Personal Information
Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren't sales, such as with our Service Providers.
The CCPA requires businesses to provide additional disclosures regarding the third parties to which we transfer Personal Information for business purposes and to whom we sell Personal Information.
We provide those disclosures in the following table.

B. Shine the Light.
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code §1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent our disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes, and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing.
We have such a policy in place as discussed above in Section X(A)(2).
==========
C. Online Erasure.
California's "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code §§ 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of Content they post.
If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Service that is directed to California residents older than 12 and younger than 18 years of age, you may request removal of the Content by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email or as described at the end of this document.
In response to your request, we may elect to make the Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the Content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the Content.
==========
Purposes of Processing.
As explained in Section IV above, we process your Personal Information to process your requests, to administer the Service, facilitate access by Service Providers, Third Party Businesses, and Related Entities, make marketing communications, facilitate health, safety and legal requests, respond to your requests in connection with employment opportunities, transfer or sell our business, and to combine data sets.
As explained in Sections V – VII, we may also use, transfer and otherwise process Personal Information acquired from you directly or by use of Tracking Technologies, for marketing purposes, including to serve you with Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA).
Legal Basis for Processing.
We serve you with OBA with your consent, and you have the right to withdraw consent at any time as described in Section VII(B) above.

We rely on the legitimate interest basis of processing for the other activities described directly above in Section XI(A) because processing Personal Information is necessary to provide you with our Products and to respond to your requests, our activities are reasonably expected by our visitors, and those activities do not unduly and negatively affect the privacy rights of our visitors.
==========
When you make a purchase, enter a sweepstakes, sign-up to attend an event or conference, or engage in another type of transaction with us, we may process your Personal Information to fulfill that contract.
We may also process your Personal Information to comply with legal obligations to which we are subject and cooperate with regulators and enforcement bodies.
==========
Transfers.
As described in Section VIII above, your Personal Information may be processed in or transferred to the U.S. or elsewhere in the world.
