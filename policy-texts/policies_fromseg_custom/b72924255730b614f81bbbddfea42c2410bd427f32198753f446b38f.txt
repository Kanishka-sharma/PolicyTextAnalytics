Information We Share
Information Shared Within the Verizon Family of Companies:

There are additional protections that apply with regard to certain information we collect and maintain about the telecommunications and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services you buy from us and how you use them.

As described in the request, you may decline or withdraw CPNI consent by not signing the consent form or by following instructions in the consent form or service agreement.
Your choice on CPNI consent will remain in effect unless you change it.
==========
If you are an Arizona resident, as required by state law, Verizon Wireless does not share your CPNI within the Verizon family of companies unless you provide consent using a form.
Customers who provide such consent are reminded annually of their current CPNI choices.
If you are a retail customer of MCI, your CPNI will not be shared within the Verizon family of companies for marketing purposes except to provide you with information about other services of the type you currently buy from us.
In addition, when you are speaking with a customer service representative, we may ask your permission to review your records, including your CPNI, to provide you with information about the full array of services provided by the Verizon family of companies.
Information Shared Outside the Verizon Family of Companies:
Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or website visitors with others outside the Verizon family of companies for non-Verizon purposes without the consent of the person whose information will be shared.
Verizon uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair and bill for services we deliver to you.
We share information with those vendors and partners to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform work on our behalf.
For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested.
==========
We require that these vendors and partners protect the customer information we may provide to them and limit their use of Verizon customer data to the purposes for which it was provided.
We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.
As described in more detail in other sections of this policy, Verizon also may share certain information with outside companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns, or preparing and sharing aggregate business and marketing reports.
Verizon provides the names, addresses and telephone numbers of wireline telephone subscribers to directory publishers and directory assistance services unless a non-published or non-listed phone number has been requested.

For these jointly offered services, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy which may be different from those described here.
If Verizon enters into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets or business, customer information will also be transferred as part of or in connection with the transaction.
Information Provided to or Used by Third-Party Advertising Entities
You may see third-party advertisements on some Verizon websites, services, or devices.
Some advertisements are chosen by companies that place advertisements on behalf of other third-party advertisers.
==========
These companies, often called ad servers or ad networks, may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit on our websites.
The information they collect from our sites is in a form that does not identify you personally.
This information may be combined with similar data obtained from other websites to help advertisers better reach their targeted audiences.
Targeting may be accomplished by tailoring advertising to interests that they infer from your browsing of our sites and your interaction with other websites where these ad servers or ad networks also are present.
If you choose to interact with specific advertisers who advertise on our sites, the information you provide to them is subject to the conditions of their specific privacy policies.
In addition, responding to or interacting with a particular advertisement, may result in you later receiving a targeted advertisement on our websites or on other sites as a result of an ad server or ad network concluding that you fit within a particular audience an advertiser is trying to reach.
==========
Advertising that is customized based on predictions generated from your visits over time and across different websites is sometimes called "online behavioral" or "interest-based" advertising.
We require that companies disclose when they are using online behavioral advertising programs to deliver third-party ads on our sites or collecting information about your visit to our sites for these purposes and give consumers the ability to opt-out of this use of their information.
You will see an icon in or around third-party advertisements that are delivered on our sites using behavioral advertising programs.
Clicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad as well as information on how you may opt-out of these advertising programs.

Additional information about "cookies" and "web beacons"
We also may provide third-party advertisers with geographic or demographic information that allows them to tailor their ads.
This information does not identify you individually.
==========
One such ad-delivery program helps advertisers reach our wireline Internet access customers within specified geographical areas.
Using your postal address, Verizon determines whether you fit the geographic area an advertising campaign is trying to reach.
We do not share your address as part of this process.
You have a choice about participating in this advertising program.
Similarly, Verizon Wireless may help advertisers better reach Verizon Wireless Internet access customers using the postal address we have for you and certain consumer information (including your device type, language preferences and demographic and interest categories provided to us by other companies, such as gender, age-range, sports fan, frequent diner or pet owner).

Working Together to Help Keep Children Safe
Verizon recognizes that online service providers must be vigilant in protecting the safety and privacy of children online.
We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under the age of 13, without obtaining verifiable parental consent.
Verizon strongly supports educating parents and young Internet users on safe viewing practices and we offer a variety of tools to help children and parents avoid encountering objectionable content or communications while using our services.
Verizon's Parental Control Center provides many free resources that offer guidance, connect parents with experts and help give parents the technical knowledge to help keep kids safer online.
==========
Regrettably, there are those who use the Internet to view, store and distribute child pornography (or who engage in other types of illegal activity involving children).
Child pornography is subject to severe criminal penalties and using the Verizon network to view, store or distribute it violates our service contracts.
The Verizon network may not be used by customers in any manner for the storage, transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography and we will report any instances of such activity of which we become aware to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
If you have a complaint about child pornography, the soliciting of children for sexual activity, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children on a Verizon service, report it to us by sending an email to abuse@verizon.net.
Please include the words "child porn" in the subject line of your email.
You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through its CyberTipline located at www.cybertipline.org.
