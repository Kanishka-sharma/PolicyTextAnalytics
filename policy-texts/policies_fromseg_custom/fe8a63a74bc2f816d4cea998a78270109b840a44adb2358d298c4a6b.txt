A current list of our publications,
                                  web sites, online webcasts, newsletters and
                                trade shows can be found at http://www.cmp.com/.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
                                  CMP collects
                                    information from our website users, subscribers
                                    and other customers.
In this section of our
                                    Privacy Statement, we describe the type of
                                    information we collect and how we use it
                                to provide better services to our customers.
Registration and Ordering 
                                  When attending our trade shows and other in-person events, participating
                                  in our customer-sponsored webcasts, using some
                                    of our websites and signing up for certain
                                    selected services (such as free subscriptions),
                                    users must first register.
During registration,
                                    users are required to give their contact
                                  information (such as name, e-mail address,
                                  mailing address and phone number).
For internal
                                  purposes, we use this information to communicate
                                  with users and provide requested services,
                                  and, for our website visitors, to provide a
                                  more personalized experience on our sites.
We also may collect demographic information
                                  (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities,
                                  company information and professional certification).
We use aggregate demographic information about
                                  our audience to improve our service, for marketing
                                  purposes and/or industry reporting purposes.
Many of our products and services are free
                                  to subscribers who meet certain demographic
                                  criteria.
Independent auditors may need to
                                  certify the eligibility of these subscribers.
In order to do that, we may collect unique
                                  identifiers (such as mother's maiden name)
                                  that we disclose to the auditors strictly for
                                  industry reporting and audit verification purposes.
For our services that require payment (such
                                  as certain events, products and subscriptions),
                                    we also collect credit card information (such
                                    as account name, number and expiration date),
                                    which is used for our or our agent's billing
                                    purposes only, and is not otherwise shared.
==========
E-mail Newsletters 
                                  If users wish to subscribe
                                    to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact
                                    information (such as name, e-mail address
                                  and, occasionally, demographic information).
We use this information in the same manner
                                  as we use contact information in the registration
                                    and ordering process described above.
Recipients
                                    of our newsletters can unsubscribe using
                                  the instructions listed at the end of the e-mail
                                    newsletter.
==========
Surveys and Contests
  								  From time to time we invite web site users and other customers to provide
                                  information via surveys or contests.
Participation
                                  in these surveys or contests is completely
                                  voluntary and the website user or other customer
                                  therefore has a choice whether to disclose
                                  requested contact information (such as name
                                  and mailing address) and demographic information
                                  (such as zip code or job title).
In addition
                                  to the other uses set forth in this policy,
                                  contact information collected in connection
                                  with surveys and contests is used to notify
                                  the winners and award prizes and to monitor
                                  or improve the use of, and satisfaction with
                                  the website or other CMP product or service.
Subject to the given customer's preferences
                                  (as described in the "Permission" section below), such information
                                    also may be shared with third party sponsors
                                    of such surveys or contests.
==========
Interactive Features 
                                  At some of our sites, we offer interactive and community features such
                                  as discussion boards, webcasts and user profiles.
Note that all personal information sent or
                                  posted via such features becomes public information
                                  for which we are not responsible.
Tell-A-Friend 
                                  If customers elect to use our referral service
                                    for informing a friend about our sites and
                                    services, we may ask them for the friend's
                                    name, job title and e-mail address.
CMP will
                                    store and use this information to send the
                                    friend an invitation.
This information may
                                    also be used to provide information about
                                    our company and related products and services.
The friend may contact us as specified in
                                    the tell-a-friend message to request that
                                    no further communications be sent.
Communications with Us 
                                  We have features where our customers can submit information to us (such
                                    as our feedback forms).
Where such submissions
                                        include requests for service, support
                                  or information, we may forward them to our

                                    request.
In addition, we may retain e-mails

                                  internal administrative purposes, and to help
                                  us to serve customers better.
Please note that
                                  letters to the editor and similar submissions

                                  In order to
                                  best serve our customers, we may send updates
                                  that contain important information about our
                                  products and services.
For example, we send
                                  new members a welcoming message, and verify
                                  password and username for our password-protected

We may also communicate with a customer

                                    issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail.
In addition to such service and product-essential
                                    messages, we offer our customers the option

Automatic Data Collection
                                  
                                  Our web sites, newsletters and, from time to time, certain other
                                  products and services have features that automatically
                                  collect information from customers, to deliver
                                  content specific to customers' interests and
                                  to honor their preferences.
This information
                                  assists us in creating products and services
                                  that will serve the needs of our customers.
==========
For example, we use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive
            containing information about the user.
Cookies benefit the user by requiring
            login only once, thereby saving time while on our web site.
If users reject the
            cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas of our web site.
For example,
            the user may not be able to participate in sweepstakes, contests or drawings.
==========
Additionally, we may note some of the pages the user visits on our web sites
            and via our email newsletters through the use of pixel tags (also called clear
            gifs) and web beacons.
The use of cookies, pixels and web beacons enable us to
            track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
            sites and via our email newsletters.
In addition, some of our business affiliates
                                  use cookies on our web sites and in our email
                                  newsletters, in ads or promotions.
However,
                                  we have no access to or control over these
                                  business affiliates' cookies; we urge users
                                  to read their privacy policies for information.
==========
In particular, we use third-party advertising technology to serve ads for CMP products and services when you visit certain CMP Web sites.
This technology uses information about your visits to these CMP Web sites (not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our ads to you.
In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser.
In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising for CMP products and services.
These web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits these sites and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web sites.
The information used in this process is not personally identifiable.

We also use an email delivery and marketing
                                  company to send emails (including newsletters)
                                  for which you have registered (or otherwise
                                  agreed to receive).
Web beacons and cookies
                                  may be used in such email messages to help
                                  us measure the effectiveness of our advertising
                                  and how customers use our web sites and other
                                products and services.
For our internal purposes,
                                  we gather date, time, browser type, navigation
                                  history and IP address of all visitors to our
                                  web sites.
==========
This information does not contain
              anything that can identify users personally.
We use this information
                                  for our internal security audit log, trend
                                  analysis and system administration, and to
                                  gather broad demographic information about
                                our user base for aggregate use.
We may combine
                                  demographic information supplied by a customer
                                  at registration with web site usage data to
                                  provide general profiles, in aggregate non-personally
              identifiable form, about our customers and their preferences in
                                  the content of the site and advertising.
==========
We
                                  may share this composite information with our
                                  advertisers and business affiliates to help
                                them better understand our services.
WITH WHOM
                                  YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED 
                                  When we have co-branded,
                                  customized, private label, "powered by" or sponsored products and services, or when we join with other parties to provide specific services (however, we do not share credit card information with such third parties), then, subject to the given customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission" section below), we may share (provide and receive) personal information with such third party.
In particular, please note that, subject to the given customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission" section
                below), information collected in connection with online webcasts, such as at
                www.netseminar.com, will be shared with the sponsor of the particular webcast(s)/seminar(s).
These sponsors will use the information according to their own privacy policies,
                and we urge participants to read those policies and be aware of their privacy
                practices before registering.
In addition, at EEProductCenter.com and related
                                  sites, information may be shared with selected
                                  advertisers if a user affirmatively clicks
                                  through on a link/ad to such advertiser at
                                those sites or in e-mails.
==========
Finally, on occasion,
                                  we may provide targeted lists of names and
                                  offline and online contact information for
                                  marketing purposes to third parties, subject
                  to our Permission policies, as described below, pursuant to
                                  which we give customers the option of not having
                                  their name or contact information disclosed
                                  to third parties.
Other than as set forth above, we do not share
                                  personally identifiable information with other
                                  companies, apart from those acting as our agents
                                  in providing our product(s)/service(s), and
                                  which agree to use it only for that purpose
                                  and to keep the information secure and confidential.
Also, our parent, subsidiary and affiliate
                                  companies, entities into which our company
                                  may be merged, or entities to which any of
                                  our assets, products, sites or operations may
                                  be transferred, will be able to use personal
                                  information.
We will also disclose information
                                  we maintain when required to do so by law,
                                  for example, in response to a court order or
                                  a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response
                                  to a law enforcement agency's request, or in
                                  special cases when we have reason to believe
                                  that disclosing this information is necessary
                                  to identify, contact or bring legal action
                                  against someone who may be causing injury to
                                  or interference with (either intentionally
                                  or unintentionally) our rights or property.
Users should also be aware that courts of equity,
                                  such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have
                                  the authority under certain circumstances to
                                  permit personal information to be shared or
                                  transferred to third parties without permission.

We may share aggregate information, which
                                  is not personally identifiable, with others.

                                  data, but it will not include personal information.

                                  to us securely.
In addition, access to all
                                  of our customers' information, not just the

Only employees who need the information
                                  to perform a specific job (for example, a billing
                                    clerk or a customer service representative)
                                    are granted access to personally identifiable
                                    information.
