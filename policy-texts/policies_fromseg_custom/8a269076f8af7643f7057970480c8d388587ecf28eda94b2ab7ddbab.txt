Zazzle's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information.
Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time.
That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases.

==========
They are subject to confidentiality agreements with Zazzle and other legal restrictions.
Zazzle does not permit any of these companies to collect personally identifiable information using cookies or web beacons on our websites.
Certain functionalities related to the provision of additional products and services require marketers to share website usage information about visitors to the Site, who have received a targeted promotional campaign, with a reputable third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.
To this end, Zazzle's third-party advertising company makes a note of some of the pages you visit on the Site through the use of pixel tags.
