			This privacy policy is intended to inform you about AERSERV’s collection, use, 
			and disclosure of information that we process for our services.
We work with industry-leading companies to address important privacy and consumer protection issues 
			in online advertising.
Personally Identifiable Information
	
			We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII").
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
	
			We collect only anonymous, non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") via our technology, 
			including but not limited to your IP host address, the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, 
			ads delivered, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer’s operating system.
Customers of our technology may utilize non-PII data that is delivered by third party providers from online or 
			offline sources.
"AERSERV Information" means information that does not directly identify and cannot reasonably be used to 
			identify an individual user.
==========
Collection of Data

			Our technology uses cookies in conjunction with "web beacons" in order to help make the online advertisements 
			you see more relevant to you.
We also use cookies and web beacons to understand your browsing and buying activities 
			so that we can measure the success of our client's online advertising campaigns.
We do not use flash cookies or 
			browser widgets.
What are Cookies?
"Cookies" are small data files placed on your computer by the websites you visit and can be used to help recognize 
				you as a user of that site when you return, or when you visit other sites.
"Flash Cookies" (also called Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") are data files similar to cookies, except that they 
				can store more complex data.
Flash cookies are used to remember settings, preferences and usage, particularly 
				for video, interactive gaming, and other similar services.
"Web beacons" are small graphic images on a Web page or in an email that can be used for such things as recording 
				the pages and advertisements clicked on by users, or tracking the performance of email marketing campaigns.
A "widget" is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page.
Widgets can provide 
				real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports, or other functionality.
Widgets are often provided by third parties, and may allow that third party to collect data about users 
				viewing that page.
==========
A Web "server log" is a record of activity created by the computer (called a "server") that delivers the 
				Web pages you request to your browser.
For example, a Web server log may record the search term you entered 
				or the link you clicked to bring you the Web page.
The Web server log also may record information about 
				your browser, such as your IP address and the cookies set on your browser by the server.
AERSERV uses cookies and web beacons only to collect data about your activity, such as data about the type of 
			browser and operating system you use, which Web pages you view, the time and duration of your visits, 
			and whether you clicked on an advertisement while on our site.
Managing Cookies

			You can configure most standard Web browsers to alert you when a website is attempting to send a cookie to your 
			computer and to allow you to accept or refuse the cookie.
You also can set most standard browsers to disable 
			the capacity to receive cookies, and to delete cookies you previously have accepted.
==========
Your browser cookie management tools will not remove Flash cookies.
Learn how to manage privacy and storage settings 
			for Flash cookies.
Please note that some Web pages may not work correctly if you have cookies disabled.
More information about 
			deleting and controlling cookies is available at http://www.aboutcookies.org 
			as well as http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/cookieoptout.html.
==========
Opting Out of the Services

			We provide multiple ways for you to opt out of our services.
We make available an AERSERV "opt-out" cookie that you 
			may download to your browser.
This cookie, when installed on your browser, will prevent us from collecting 
			data on that browser.
==========
You can opt out here.
By opting out of the AERSERV cookie you are also opting out of 
			targeting options from AERSERV through some of our third party partners.
You can opt back in here.
==========
Our opt-out tool is cookie-based.
Both opt-out tools only prevent us from collecting data pertaining to you on the 
			browser on which they are installed, and will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies.
If you delete an opt-out cookie from a browser’s cookie files, we will collect data from that browser until an opt-out 
			cookie is set again on that browser.
Additionally, you may prevent us from collecting data on a browser by blocking third-party cookies in that 
			browser.
If you block third-party cookies from being set on your browser, you may not be able to enjoy some 
			features or functionality of, and you may see the same content and advertisements repeatedly on some Web sites.
If the AERSERV opt-out cookie is left undeleted, its opt-out function will survive for up to five years.
Reporting

			We may provide reports to our customers who access the collected data.
Our customers may use these reports 
			to determine information about consumer response to their advertising.
These reports may also be used for 
			billing, auditing, and other operational purposes.
These reports are prepared using aggregated information 
			on users’ activity on Web sites on which data is collected and used.
To prepare our reports, 
			we maintain log files for no longer than thirty-six months.
Our reports and log files do not include any 
			personally identifiable information about users.
==========
Children

			The services of AERSERV are not intended for persons under 13 years of age.
AERSERV’s products and services 
			are not developed or directed at children.
We do not knowingly solicit or collect any personally identifiable 
			information from children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly market our products or services to children 
			under the age of 13.
==========
Data Security

			We maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, 
			unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction.
The data is kept on 
			secure servers and we restrict access to the data solely to authorized users.
No security measures, however 
			thorough, are perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not 
			offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess.
Data Retention
	
			We retain the information collected for up to thirty-six months.
After thirty-six months, some of the information 
			we have (e.g., anonymous web logs) may be aggregated for statistical purposes and stored indefinitely, and the 
			rest of the information is destroyed.
==========
Updates to This Policy

		We may update this policy from time to time.
When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the beginning 
		of the policy.
We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we collect, use, a
		nd disclose data.
