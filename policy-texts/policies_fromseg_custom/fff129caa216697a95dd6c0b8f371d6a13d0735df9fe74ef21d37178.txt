Help Using Friv
To play the games on Friv you should ensure that you have the latest Adobe Flash Player plugin installed and check your browser settings to ensure you have Javascript enabled.
Friv will run best on newer computers, especially those with high resolution displays.
Unfortunately Friv cannot generally be accessed from handheld mobile devices such as Apple's iPad, iPhone and iPhod Touch, or other devices such as telephones and tablet computers running Android or Windows operating systems.
Users experiencing trouble accessing the friv.com domain (perhaps because access is restricted by an internet service provider or proxy) might try accessing friv.co.uk instead.
If you are reading this because you are viewing Friv from within another website then please simply click here to go to our homepage ...good luck!
==========
Your Safety
The internet provides some amazing experiences, but it is a largely unregulated system, and this naturally presents some issues regarding user safety.
As Friv is in large part accessed by younger, more vulnerable users, it's important to know about the features (and perhaps more importantly, the absence of features) which help make Friv a safer place to play.
Friv very rarely communicates directly with users, but much more importantly, Friv does not facilitate communication between users.
==========
There are no forums or chat rooms on Friv, and this is instrumental in preventing inappropriate contact and bullying.
The games on Friv have been systematically checked to ensure that they are appropriate for a younger audience.
While it can't be said that none of the games feature violence (even Pac Man may be regarded as violent) we have tried to keep the content on Friv in line with what children might see at home on television channels aimed at younger viewers.
We have worked hard to ensure that the players on Friv are not exposed to overt sexual imagery, references to illegal drug use, or depictions of extreme violence and gore.
==========
Your Privacy
The privacy of users is extremely important to us.
Below you will find information detailing the types of data received and collected by Friv and other parties, and how it is used.
Log Files: As with all websites, Friv's servers record details of which files are accessed, along with data such as the time the request was made, and the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the user.
Although each computer may have a unique IP address, this identifier is never linked to any personal information such as the name or street address of the user.
Log files have been used universally since the dawn of the internet and are invaluable in identifying errors with web pages and, in the case of Friv, with the games.
Our servers are set to keep daily log files for a maximum of one month, after which they are permanently deleted.
==========
Cookies / Flash Shared Objects: To help provide an enhanced user experience, most modern browsers allow websites to store small amounts of data on users' computers.
This information is stored in the form of small text files called 'cookies' or, in the case of the interactive content on Friv, in 'Flash Shared Objects'.
==========
Examples of the information stored might include the number of games a user has played, the country the user is in (as taken from the user's IP address), and the level progress made on a game.
Unless a user specifically enters personal data, no data stored is personally identifiable.
==========
You can at any time delete the cookies and Flash Shared Objects your computer holds ...just check your browser's privacy settings.
Tracking: Sometimes our menu system and the games on Friv may send information to third-party tracking services.
==========
The information collected (while never personally identifiable) is useful, for example, in providing general insights into visitor numbers and which games are most popular.
Advertising Networks: Keeping a popular website up and running can be expensive, and so sometimes we show advertisements which help generate income.
==========
The ads are typically served by third party ad networks, and although we try hard to ensure that the companies advertising are reliable and honest, the reality of the internet means that our influence over the every-changing offerings of these networks is limited.
Ad networks will typically show ads based on the kind of users they expect to be playing on Friv, and as described above, may store small amounts of data on a user's computer.
This information, which is never personally identifiable, may help advertisers target an individual user based on their visit to Friv and other sites and pages they have viewed in the past.
==========
This kind of advertising, which has become increasingly popular, is called retargeting.
Users are now given greater control than ever over how ad networks use this data.
You can opt out of the cookie / retargeting functions of many of these networks by clicking here.
==========
Unless otherwise stated, all the games on Friv are copyrighted by their respective owners and / or authors.
The collection of games is provided as freeware, freely distributable, public domain or open source.
Although we have mostly stopped accepting submissions from new developers, those who have already successfully submitted games may continue to do so.
