Collection and Use of Online Information
						Our web server automatically collects your IP address when you visit our site.
(Your IP address is your computer's unique address that lets other computers attached to the Internet know where to send data, but does not identify you individually.)
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to compile statistics on site usage.
We do not make your IP address available to anyone outside the District's technology staff.
To provide better service and a more effective website, sections of this site may use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser.
==========
A cookie is a small text file (typically only a few bytes) that we place on your hard drive to allow our server to identify your computer.
Our cookies will not attempt to read any information on your hard drive, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine your identity or your email address.
When you visit certain areas of this site, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (such as name, address, gender, and, potentially, credit card number) that we need to process your request.
==========
In the event that you decline to provide such information, you limit our ability to serve you.
Still, we invite you to continue to visit the site and take advantage of the wealth of information it offers.
