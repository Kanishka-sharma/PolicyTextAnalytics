DoubleClick's Privacy Commitment

DoubleClick is a media company that provides technology and services that make digital marketing and Internet advertising work better.
DoubleClick is committed to striving to meet or exceed fair information practices.
The following privacy statement covers our current products and services, as well as activities at this web site.
Following are some of the principles to which we adhere.
==========
Please click on the links on this page for more information about a specific product or technology.
DoubleClick does not use your name, address, email address, or phone number to deliver Internet ads.
DoubleClick does use information about your browser and your prior web surfing to determine which ads to show your browser.
When DoubleClick delivers email for a company, that company must show us that consumers have agreed to receive email messages from that company before we deliver the email messages.
DoubleClick encourages all companies with which we do business (also called "clients"), to engage in fair information practices.
==========
In particular, DoubleClick asks that these companies disclose their relationship with us by providing notice to consumers about the DoubleClick technologies that they use.
DoubleClick asks clients to link from their privacy policy to ours to allow consumers to opt-out of the DoubleClick cookie, so that no unique information or number is associated with your computer's browser if you choose.
When DoubleClick acts as a technology vendor, DoubleClick has been asked by the web site to act as an agent for ad delivery or reporting.
The information DoubleClick processes on such a web site's behalf belongs to that web site and is not used by DoubleClick or other companies.
When web sites contract with DoubleClick to share anonymous web site data for future ad serving across the Internet in addition to providing advertising or other services, clients must comply with the Network Advertising Initiative guidelines (visit www.networkadvertising.org).
Only web sites in the United States share data with us in this manner.
==========
DoubleClick does not use information about a user's individual health condition, detailed financial information, sexual orientation or behavior, information that appears to relate to children under 13, racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical opinions, and trade union membership to deliver advertising.
In most cases, when DoubleClick collects personal information online, such as in a sweepstakes or survey, we do so on behalf of another company (as an agent or processor).
You can access this information by requesting to see that information from the company to which you provided it.
==========
If DoubleClick collects personal information from you for our own purposes (such as to process an employment application on this site), we will provide you with reasonable access to that information.
DoubleClick may change its policy as new products are added or old ones are changed, but DoubleClick treats personal information in a manner consistent with the policy under which it was collected, unless we have your consent to use it differently.
==========
If part or all of DoubleClick's businesses are sold or transferred, we will take steps to assure that these same principles apply.
To ensure that DoubleClick does what it says and says what it does, there are procedures in place for independent third parties to audit and verify DoubleClick's internal practices.
==========
Final audit letters will be posted at this site.
If you have questions about our privacy policy, please contact us and we will address your concerns.
Information about us is located at the "privacy team" link on this page, or you can email us at privacy@doubleclick.net.
==========
On this page you will see links to more information about DoubleClick's products and services and information on how these products and services impact you as a consumer through the collection and/or use of personal information about you (such as your name, address, or email address) or the collection and/or use of non-personal information (such as information about your computer and your web surfing activities that is not linked to your name and address).
DoubleClick is also committed to enhancing consumer understanding of the technologies that are used to provide information and transmit data.

Further, DoubleClick provides the opportunity to opt-out of DoubleClick's unique cookies.
If you opt-out, a unique cookie is overwritten with a non-unique DoubleClick cookie that serves as a placeholder, so that no new unique cookie is assigned to your browser.
