A list of the URLs covered by this policy is included

This Online Data Policy may be modified in our sole

This Online Data 
			Policy is consistent with and remains subject to Privacy for Consumers at Citigroup.
==========
Unless otherwise specified, the following terms do not apply to Cititrade, 
			the web site of any other Citigroup company or any other web site, even 
			if such web site(s) are accessible through Citi.com.
Cookies

			A cookie is a piece of information which a web server may place on your 
			computer when you visit a web site.
Cookies are commonly used by web sites 
			to improve the user experience and have not been known to transmit computer 
			viruses or otherwise harm your computer.
Many cookies last only through a 
			single session, or visit.
Others may have an expiration date, or may remain 
			on your computer until you delete them.
How We Use Cookies

			We use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain 
			continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our 
			web site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for 
			certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a username 
			or encrypted customer identification number so that you do not have to 
			provide this information every time you return to our site.
==========
Our cookies will track only your activity relating to our online promotions, 
			which may be located at our web site or the web sites of others, and your 
			online activity on our web site.
They will not track your other internet 
			activity.
Cookies set by us cannot be read by and are not shared with any 
			non-Citigroup web site, although we may share some of the cookie information 
			we gather with other Citigroup companies.
Our cookies typically do not 
			gather personally identifiable information.
==========
Cookie Filters

			You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring 
			your preferences or options in your browser.
However, if you choose to reject 
			cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our online services or web 
			site features.
Your browser software may contain a feature which is intended to notify you 
			of the cookie policies of the various web sites you visit.
For example, the 
			Microsoft® Internet Explorer 6 browser software contained in Microsoft® 
			Windows® XP contains a version of such a cookie-filtering device, commonly 
			known as P3P.
==========
To learn more about P3P and how it may affect your online 
			experience go to www.w3.org/P3P.
Citibank has attempted to make Citi.com 
			compatible with the P3P privacy filtering tool.
However, P3P is still an evolving 
			standard and therefore, we are not responsible for any problems you experience 
			when using a P3P filter, or any discrepancies between the machine-coded statement 
			of our privacy policy which are read by the P3P tool and the human readable policy 
			which you see here and in the Privacy Notice of the Citigroup affiliate which 
			maintains your account.
This Online Data Policy and your Citigroup affiliate's 
			Privacy Notice are the controlling documents to which you should refer if you 
			have questions about Citibank's privacy policies.
==========
Cookies of Other Companies

			We occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our web sites and gather 
			cookie information for us.
In some cases we will also use another company to 
			operate web servers for our sites.
We use the cookie information gathered by 
			these companies in the same manner as stated in the previous section.
The 
			companies we use may not use these cookies for their own internal purposes 
			or share the information gathered with anyone other than Citibank, in 
			accordance with the terms of the contracts they have signed with us.
Because of the way in which P3P works, these companies must provide their 
			own human-readable and machine-coded privacy statements regarding the cookies 
			they set for us, or the web sites they operate for us.
Because, as explained 
			above, P3P is still an evolving standard, we are not responsible for the 
			accuracy of such statements, any discrepancies between another company's 
			machine-coded and human readable statements or any problems you may experience 
			when using a P3P filtering tool.
==========
General Website Practices

			which you provide to us online - for example, when you are doing your online 
			banking with us, when you use our tools and calculators or when you submit an 
			application or otherwise communicate with us.
In some cases, we retain both the 
			cookie information and/or the information you provide to us online - for example, 
			to complete a transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past 
			transactions.
In other cases - for example, when you use our tools and calculators - 
			we only retain the cookie and/or online information you give us if you request us
