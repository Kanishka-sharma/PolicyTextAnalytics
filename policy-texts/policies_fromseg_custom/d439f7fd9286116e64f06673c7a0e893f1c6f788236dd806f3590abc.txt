COPPA
We are especially concerned about protecting  children’s privacy.
Therefore, we comply  with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).
COPPA and its accompanying Federal Trade  Commission regulation establish United States Federal law that protects the  privacy of children using the Internet.
We encourage parents and teachers to involve themselves in children’s  Internet explorations.
==========
We do not  intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13.
Our “Kids’ Place” page does not require  children to provide any information that could personally identify them.
If, however, a child chooses to provide  personally identifying information to us, through an e-mail or otherwise, we  will only use it to respond to the inquiry and we will not retain it.
==========
Cookies
What is a “cookie?”
A cookie is a small piece of text that is  sent to your computer along with a webpage when you visit a website.
Your computer will give the information in  the cookie only to the computer that sent it, and no other website can request  it.
==========
There are three types of cookies--persistent,  third-party, and session.
We never use  persistent or third-party cookies, but sometimes we use session cookies.
We use session cookies only in some places where you  can transact business.
==========
We store the  cookie on your computer only during your visit.
The session cookie keeps you  from losing information you have entered for a business transaction with us if,  during your visit, you leave our website and return.
Once you turn off your computer or stop using  the Internet, the cookie is erased.
==========
Security
The Internet was originally designed as an open  system with no built-in security; however, we are required to protect the  information we collect and maintain about you and will not use the Internet to  do business with you unless we can do so in a secure manner.
We will take reasonable precautions to  maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we  collect at this site.
We take the  following steps to secure the information we collect.
==========
Employ  internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your  information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties.
Train  appropriate personnel on our privacy and security policies to know requirements  for compliance.
Secure  the areas where we retain paper copies of the information we collect online.
Perform  regular backups of the information we collect online to ensure against loss.
Use  technical controls to secure the information we collect online including, but  not limited to:
          
Secure  Socket Layer (SSL)
Encryption
Firewalls
Password  protections


Periodically  test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance.
Employ  external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized tries of  outsiders to “hack” into, or cause harm to, the information contained in our  systems.
When we use contractors to perform various website and  database functions.
We make sure that  the agreement language with the contractor ensures the security, confidentiality,  and integrity of any personal information the contractor may have access to in  the course of contract performance.
==========
Email
We suggest that you do  not send personal information to us via email.
We will only send you general information via email.
Electronic mail messages  that meet the definition of records in the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 3101  et seq.) are covered under the same disposition schedule as all other Federal  records.
This means that emails you send  us will be preserved and maintained for varying periods of time if those emails  meet the definition of Federal records.
Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer  needed.
==========
Visiting Other Websites
Our website contains links to international  agencies, private organizations, and some commercial entities.
These websites are not within our control and  may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility polices.
Once you link to another site, you are  subject to the policies of that site.
All Federal websites, however, are subject to the same Federal policy,  security, or accessibility mandates.
