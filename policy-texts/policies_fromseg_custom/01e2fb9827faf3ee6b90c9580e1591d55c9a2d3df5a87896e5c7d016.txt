Bottom line: We know that almost no one reads those 10 page TOS guidelines, so we'll make this short and sweet...
You're free to put up anything with a genuine purpose.
Generally something that your grandmother would accept or like.
==========
Other than that, you are PROHIBITED from putting any content that's related to the following: (If found, our staff and automated scripts will FIND AND REMOVE THEM INSTANTLY and your I.P. banned from 110mb network.)
To be banned by 110MB & have your account deleted, do this: 



Phishing of any company, especially MySpace, eBay, PayPal and other banks.
(This is when a scammer creates a fake company site that looks real, hence tricking the visitor to enter their username/password.)
==========
Hosting Proxy  Scripts (like PHProxy).
These are scripts that allow a visitor to enter any domain through your site, and the domain won't pickup the visitors true I.P. address.
Proxy scripts are way to CPU resource intensive.
Hosting Torrent Scripts (like TorrentFlux, SendSpace, RapidLeech).
==========
This is when torrents are downloaded to 110mb servers and you later on download it to your PC.
Hosting Radio Blogs.
These  imply that a member will be hosting hundreds of music files.
110mb is not a file host.
It's a web host.
Hence not allowed.
==========
Hosting phpMyAdmin script.
phpMyAdmin (manages MySQL databases) is extremely CPU resource intensive.
==========
See forum for alternatives.
Hosting  your own PHP file manager.
Using your own file manager (to upload, delete, etc..
.
files) puts a security risk on the network.
==========
Hence not allowed.
Having more then 3 accounts.
If you registered more then 3 accounts, all of them will be found and deleted.
Eg: acc1/acc2/acc3/acc4.110mb.com.
That's a no-no!
==========
Generally no serious member needs more then 1.
Sales or promotion of beer, hard alcohol, tobacco or drugs.
This especially includes pharmaceutical medicines and stimulators like Viagra and Cialis.
==========
Using your domain to spam other sites.
Do you like getting spam?
Nope.
Does the next person you're targeting?
Nope.
Then don't do it!
==========
110MB contacts any spammers ISP (no!
proxy services can't hide you) to shut down their internet connection and get the spammers personal information.
Storing  illegal files on your 110mb account.
==========
Includes software/cracks/scripts.
These infringe the rights of it's copyright holders, hence not allowed.
==========
Child porn.
(This is UNrelated to adult porn material, which is ALLOWED.)
Child porn sites are doomed to be found and deleted instantly.
==========
Using your account primarily as a file storage medium.
110mb is a working website hosting service.
Not a place to backup/store your files without having a proper working site.
==========
Therefore all accounts that take over 100MB are subject to human checking  and deleted if it violates this point.
Having incorrect/garbage name or address filed on your account.
Eg: A name like "Aaadfdf Ffdfsf" or address like "44444444 Ptrc Rd".
==========
This tells us that you have not read our TOS and don't respect our service.
As a result, your account is deleted.
==========
Not having a homepage at all or still having original homepage file from over 15 days from your signup date.
This point will clearly tell us you didn't bother to read the TOS or the welcome email or anything at all.
==========
QUESTION: Are porn sites allowed?
ANSWER: Yes they are totally allowed.
But with exception of child porn (where you have 7-14 year old naked girls.)
Furthermore, rudeness to staff members for support will NOT be tolerated under any conditions.
==========
In occurrence, you'll be ignored.
In repetitive occurrences, your IP will be banned from 110mb network and account deleted.
