Additional personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. while completing an online contact form, as part of a registration, survey, competition, fulfillment of contract or an information request.
==========
The legal basis for the processing of the aforementioned data categories is Art. 6 (1) (a) of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Due to the said purposes, in particular to guarantee security and a smooth connection setup, we have a legitimate interest to process this data.
The web tracking data will be stored for a period of 36 months and then automatically deleted.

For contractual reasons, we also need personal data to provide our services and comply with the obligations arising from contractual agreements concluded with you.
This data is used e. g. for performing a (shipment) contract, managing customer data, handling payments and, as the case may be, assessing creditworthiness.
Certain shipment data will also be provided to the authorities of the country of transit or destination for customs and tax clearance or for security screening, as required by the laws of such country.
The information provided would usually include: shipper name and address, receiver name and address, description of the goods, number of pieces, weight and value of shipment.

==========
We use the online advertising program "Google AdWords" and the conversion tracking function of Google AdWords.
Google conversion tracking is an analytics service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google").
When you click on an ad delivered by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your computer.
==========
These cookies expire after 30 days, do not contain any personal data and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally.
If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can tell that you clicked on the ad and were directed to that page.
Each Google AdWords customer has a different cookie, so it is not possible to track cookies via websites of other AdWords customers.
The information collected by means of the conversion cookie is used to compile conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking.
Customers can see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page containing a conversion tracking tag.
However, they do not receive information that enables them to identify users personally.
If you do not want to participate in conversion tracking, you can opt out of this use and prevent cookies from being installed by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software (deactivation option).
You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
Further information and Google's Privacy Policy are available at:
