What Data Does Foursquare Hold?
Foursquare holds the following categories of data:
device level information (e.g. advertising identifier, geolocation data);
personal information (e.g. email address or another personal identifier)
location signals (e.g. wifi network, beacon data);

payment and billing information, if you created a developer account and use our API or have claimed a listing on Foursquare CityGuide.
For a complete summary, please see our California Consumer Privacy Statement.

==========
Where Does this Data Come From?
Foursquare data comes from a variety of sources.
==========
Developer Tools
We license our developer tools - our application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and our software development kits (“SDKs”).
We may obtain data from our customers and our developer community that access or use our API.
The data we obtain relates to API usage information and may include the IP address of the device or server accessing the APIs.
We use this data to measure performance and to improve the delivery of our APIs to our customers and our developer community.
We may also obtain other data if our enterprise customers and developers agree to share data with us.
For example, we may obtain the location of an individual using a customer’s mobile application when that individual tags their location in a social post using our API.
Mobile application developers may use our SDKs in their apps to provide location-based services to users of their apps.
For example, we may partner with a developer who uses our location technology to display interesting places of relevance to their users based on their users’ geocoordinates.
==========
We retain such information about the users of those apps if the developer has contractually agreed to allow us to retain and use this information.
This data includes a user’s device data (e.g. mobile advertising identifier, device type, operating system), installed apps, and geocoordinates from or about the device.
We use this data to develop our business products and services (“Products”), and, if contractually permitted, we may license such data to our customers.
If we have obtained your data from a developer and you would like your data deleted, please contact that developer to submit your deletion request.
At this time, we are only able to delete data collected hereunder if requested by the developer.
==========
Data Suppliers
We may license data from unaffiliated third parties, such as third-party developers, data aggregators, and ad tech platforms, which we may use to send interest-based advertising or to combine with data we already have to provide our Products.
Data we license may include your personal information, your usage on unaffiliated websites and apps, your web browsers or operating systems characteristics, your mobile advertising identifiers, the geolocation coordinates of your devices, app name, your IP address, and other device-level information and demographic information, location and interest-based data.
==========
Brands, Agencies and Online Ad Platforms
In some cases, we receive data from our customers such as brands, advertising agencies, or online ad platforms, to provide services to those customers and their advertising clients.
We do not use this data in our Products.
Business Representatives/Developers
We also collect data about individuals acting in their professional capacity as a representative of a developer, vendor, supplier or customer, including name and email address, job title, phone number, billing and payment information, and, if you visit our websites, IP address, browser data, cookie data and other information.
We do not combine the data collected from these individuals with any data about users of our Consumer Services.
We may collect data provided by developers that use our API including when creating their developer account profiles.
We may also obtain certain data about a developer’s usage of his or her account (such as time of use and device information).
3.
==========
How Is Data Used By Foursquare?
Our Products
We use data to develop, offer, and improve our Products.
This includes:
improving our “points of interest” data, which our customers use in their own products and services (e.g. displaying points of interests on a map);
understanding which devices have visited a point of interest such as a store or restaurant;
enabling customers to target advertising and personalize content and services based on inferred preferences such as ‘coffee drinker’ or ‘yoga enthusiast’;
allowing our customers to measure conversion as to whether an individual has seen its ad (offline or online, including on websites, in mobile apps or on TV streaming devices or smart TVs (in this case, we will assist our customers by combining data that we have about you together with the data we receive from our customers about advertisements you may have seen online, on a TV or in the real world);
assisting our customers better understand consumer preferences and behaviors;
enriching our customers’ data assets;
matching data to add, amend or otherwise change data profiles;
operating, evaluating and improving our business, including developing, enhancing and improving Products; performing data analytics and market research; managing our communications; and performing accounting, auditing, marketing, and other operational functions (such as communicating with developers and customers about their accounts).
==========
Protection of Our Rights
We may use your data to protect the rights and property Foursquare, the Consumer Services, our users and employees, or any third party.
For example, we may use your data to protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liability.
We also may use your data to comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies, including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service or Policies.
4.
==========
When is Data Shared?
We share data in the following circumstances:
With our customers when they buy or license our Products.
In these instances, we may share a mobile advertising identifier or another identifier, visited a location such as a coffee shop, or data in an aggregated form.
We do not share raw latitude and longitude coordinates, nor do we share inferred home and work location.
Data is shared only after it has been processed into an inferred visit to a public location (such as a store or a restaurant).
We may also share a chain of processed visits to public locations such as a device went to John’s Coffee Shop, then to Sarah’s Yoga Studio and then to Jenny’s Juice Bar.
==========
With our service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud storage, IT services, and marketing.
These service providers may be located in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected, such as the United States.
We do not authorize our service providers to retain, use or disclose the data except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
With our affiliates and subsidiaries.
If there is a corporate event, including, as part, or in anticipation, of a business sale, merger, consolidation, joint venture, investment, change in control, transfer of substantial corporate assets, reorganization, liquidation, or similar business transaction or corporate event.
With our developer community or third parties for analytical or other purposes.
==========
If you have given us consent to share your data.
We also may share data (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (iii) to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm, or financial loss; (v) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; and (vi) to protect the rights, property or safety of Foursquare and our products and services, our employees, our customers and users, and others.

==========
We use these technologies for a number of purposes, such as for authentication, security, preference settings, advertising, and analytics.
We sometimes work with advertisers or other partners, and advertising service providers to serve ads to you on a third party website or app, that may be relevant to you based on your interaction with the Enterprise Services.

Interest-Based Advertising
Through our Enterprise Services, both we and certain third parties (such as our customers) may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.
==========
You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we use third-party ad services.
Through such ad services, we can target our messaging based on inferred interests and browsing context.
==========
These services track online activities over time and across multiple online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons, device identifiers and other similar technologies.
The ad services use this information to show ads that may be tailored to your interests.
The information ad services may collect includes data about your visits to our Enterprise Services and other websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad services, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps.
This data collection takes place both on our Enterprise Services and on unaffiliated third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad services.
==========
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

U.S. Consumer Rights & Disclosures
U.S. Opt Out
In the United States, the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) have established rules about interest-based advertising including cross-device linking for such advertising.
Interest-based advertising is digital advertising that is tailored to a consumer’s inferred interests, preferences, and locations.
Cross-device linking is the practice of associating different browsers and/or devices (such as mobile devices and televisions) based on information about the likely relationships among them.
==========
Foursquare is a member of the NAI and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct as described on the NAI website.
We adhere to the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles as described on the DAA website.
==========
At this time, we do not honor web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals or other similar mechanisms, and we may use or transfer data for interest-based advertising, including cross-device linking.
You may opt out of seeing interest-based advertising from us, our customers or our third party advertising partners who participate in the NAI or the DAA on your desktop browser and/or mobile web browser by visiting the DAA consumer choices page or the NAI opt out page.
You may also opt out of seeing interest-based ads on TV streaming devices and smart TVs by visiting the NAI’s opt out for these devices at https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/).
==========
You may opt out of seeing interest-based ads and ad delivery/reporting by downloading the DAA’s AppChoices mobile application, which is available here:
DAA AppChoices iOS
DAA AppChoices Android
DAA AppChoices Amazon
When you opt out on a particular device, we will stop using and transferring mobile app data from that device for interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, other linked devices.
Additionally, we will also stop using mobile app data coming from other linked devices for interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, the device from which the choice was exercised.
If you use more than one device, you should opt out on each device.
==========
If you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but they will no longer be based on your interests or behavior.
In addition, we may also continue to collect, use and transfer mobile app data for purposes other than interest-based advertising and ad delivery/reporting, as described in the “How Is My Data Used By Foursquare” section of this Privacy Policy.
If you are a California resident, for more information about your privacy rights, see the section below titled “California Residents”.
U.S. Segment Disclosure
The NAI requires members to disclose standard interest segments that are based on health- and wellness-related interests and information, or based on political information or interests, and that are used to deliver interest-based advertisements in the United States.
==========
“Interest segments” are groups of users and certain general interest categories that are inferred based on a variety of factors.
Foursquare Labs, Inc. and its affiliates provide customers with such standard segments to deliver interest-based advertisements and for other purposes; our health segments are based on data that is not considered sensitive under the NAI Code of Conduct.
