ABP’s Cookie Policy
ABP operates a strict privacy policy.
We are committed to being transparent about how we use cookies on ABP’s sites and the technologies that underpin their collection and usage.
Why cookies are important
Cookies help make your online experience more efficient and relevant to your interests.
For instance, they are used to remember your preferences on sites you visit often, to remember your user ID and the contents of your shopping baskets, and to help you navigate between pages more efficiently.
==========
Please read below for more detail.
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small file, or files on your computer, phone, or other device with a browser to save snippets of text for reference by the website you are visiting.
All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser.
Session cookies
These are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you close your browser.
For example, we use session cookies to grant access to content and enable commenting (things you have to log in to do).
Persistent cookies 
These usually have an expiration date and so stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them.
For example we use persistent cookies for functionality including the "Stay logged-in" tick box.
==========
We also use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so that we can improve the site for our customers.
We've included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies and other technologies we use.
Other technologies linked to cookies
There are other technologies which can seem similar to cookies, but are not the same, including pixels and site tags.
These pixels or tags can be used to retrieve information such as your device type or operating system, IP address, time of visit, etc. (Please see our Privacy Policy for more details on the types of information that may be collected.)
They are sometimes used to create or access the cookies on your browser, but are not cookies themselves.
Only cookies which you can control will appear in the cookie consent tool.

What types of cookies do ABP’s sites use and why?

==========
They also provide you with features, insights, and customized content in conjunction with our plugins.
You can learn more about plugins in our Privacy Policy.
Advertising We may use cookies to show you relevant advertising both on and off the ABP.
We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action (e.g. downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on the advertiser’s site.
Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we’ve shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.
We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off ABP, such as after you’ve visited a partner’s site or application.
==========
Performance, Analytics and Research Cookies help us learn how well our site and plugins perform in different locations.
We also use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access ABP from other websites, applications, or devices such as your work computer or your mobile device.
To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of third-party cookies to trusted partners of ABP.
==========
For example, we currently allow partners including:
Ventuno and Youtube for our multimedia platform, and Doubleclick (Google) for our advertising platform;
We also use third party information from third party sources to enable us to deliver advertising.
Establishing a particular audience demographic allows us to target advertising based on browsing behaviour stored in a cookie.
These sources are validated by the third party, not by us.
Our advertising partners use cookies accompanying the adverts to enable them and their advertisers to monitor the effectiveness of their ads.
==========
We may also use cookies and your IP address to discover general information about which pages on our sites you visit and the country, city or region in which you are located.
We sometimes combine this with information provided to us by third parties, together this information enables you to be grouped with other people with similar interests and places you in a market segment, such as "technology", "Android Phone", or .
We may then display advertisements which we believe people in your market segment will find relevant.
We believe this makes the advertising more interesting and useful to you, and also helps us increase the value we get out of the site from our advertisers, and therefore ultimately gives us a greater ability to invest in great content for the benefit of all users.
We may also allow advertisers to use their own marketing data to target advertising campaigns on this website and as a result you may see advertising based upon website content you have been viewing on another website.
For example, a retailer might use information about the products you browsed on their website in order to tailor their advert to you on this website.
This information is not shared with us and we do not share information with the advertiser about your browsing of our website.

Frequently Asked Questions
Will I be able to access content if I disable cookies?
You can still browse our sites with cookies disabled, although some functions may not work.
For example, ticking the “Stay logged-in” box at log-in will not actually keep you logged in to the site unless you have enabled cookies.
If you choose not to allow cookies when you first visit our websites and/or subsequently opt out of cookies, then because of the fact we’re unable to recognise you when you come back to the site, you’ll be asked again to set your cookie preferences.
