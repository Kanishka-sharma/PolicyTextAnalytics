Privacy Policy:  White Ops Technology and Services
White Ops, Inc. ("White Ops") provides cutting-edge anti-fraud solutions across a 
spectrum of industries from advertising to eCommerce to Big Data and Enterprise Business.
This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect 
through the White Ops products, services and reporting platforms.
Our Detection Tag and the 
technology behind it (our "Technology") determines humanity or non-humanity on a 
per-session level by examining and analyzing certain characteristics upon each pageload.
Collection and Use of Internet Data
White Ops uses various technologies, described below, to collect session-specific data 
in order to deliver antifraud solutions to our customers (collectively, our "Services").
==========
The Services use JavaScript and/or pixels that place a small piece of HTML code either on a webpage, 
across a domain, or at the server level, to collect information about web visits.
This information is 
used to provide the Services.
The types of data we collect using this technology include:


* Various parts of the HTTP Header (including IP Address, HREF, Referrer, and User Agent)
* Various aspects of the browser rendering engine
* Generalized user interaction data


We may work, alone or with our partners, to anonymously integrate analytic data with data that 
those partners have independently collected to deliver enhanced antifraud services.
Use of Information

White Ops collects no personally identifiable information via our Services.
We do collect non-personally 
identifiable information such as IP address, browser type, referring URL, and information on the click 
behavior of the visitor during a browser session.
==========
We use this information in order to provide our Services, 
and we may share that information with our clients to help them ensure fraud-free advertising campaigns and 
eCommerce transactions, and to ensure the security of online Enterprise business products and services.
We 
also use the information for analytics that aid us in building a historic record of behavior patterns in 
order to enhance future Services, without collecting any personally identifiable information.
Data Security and Integrity

White Ops makes every reasonable effort to protect the information in our care from loss, misuse, alteration or 
destruction.
==========
Only authorized employees and clients have access to the data that we gather and that access is 
limited by need.
All employees who have access to client data are enjoined to maintain the confidentiality of 
such information.
No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure; 
therefore, while we strive to use all commercially reasonable means to protect client information, that cannot 
guarantee absolute security.
==========
Use of Collected Data

Except as otherwise stated herein, White Ops does not share information gathered by the Services except: 
(1) as is necessary to execute the Services; (2) in aggregated formats for general corporate marketing and 
industry benchmarking; (3) for sharing with official affiliates and/or partners of White Ops or service 
providers of White Ops (where the service providers are required to use the information only to perform 
services for White Ops); (4) as required by law or to comply with legal process; or (5) to a third party 
in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition 
of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or 
similar proceedings).
Privacy Policy:  Client Portal (our "Dashboard") 

This section explains how White Ops collects, uses, stores and protects the information gathered from our 
Client Portal, which is also sometimes referred to as the White Ops Dashboard.
The Dashboard is a password 
protected website for clients and prospective clients, which are usually businesses.
Collection and Use of Information

White Ops generally collects personally identifiable information from clients and prospective clients and 
requires a User ID and password in order to use the Dashboard.
We use this information in order to create 
and maintain business records, billing information, and for other purposes essential to our client relationships.
We generally store this information so long as we maintain a business relationship with a given client and for a 
reasonable time after the termination of the business relationship, for billing and compliance purposes.
==========
Our Dashboard also collects certain non-personally identifiable information.
For example, we log reporting 
transactions for the purposes of monitoring and improving our quality of service and the overall performance 
of the Dashboard and our client reporting in general.
Data Reporting

White Ops shares collected information with our clients, affiliates and partners to perform and deliver the 
antifraud services that we have been contracted to provide.
The primary means by which we provide information 
to our customers is in aggregated reports provided as part of the White Ops Services, including but not limited 
to our customer dashboard, which is password-protected.
Use of the dashboard provides each client only with 
access to their own company's information, and provides potential clients only with access to sample reports 
within the Dashboard.
We may also provide aggregate, anonymized data in our marketing and promotional materials.
==========
Use of Cookies on the Dashboard

Cookies are small pieces of information transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to 
enable our systems to recognize your preferences and settings.
We use cookies on the Dashboard to maintain 
authenticated access and user sessions.
We also use cookies to ensure authorized access to client-specific 
secure content and reports.
When accessing client-specific secure content, you are acting as a representative 
of your company and your interactions with our site in this capacity are governed by our relationship agreement 
with your company.

information described herein.
