Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Authorize.Net’s treatment of personally identifiable information collected from merchants (hereafter “merchant” or “you”) who use the Authorize.Net payment gateway services, as well as consumer information that we acquire in the course of our business.
This Policy also covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that Authorize.Net’s business partners may share with it.
This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Authorize.Net does not own or control, or to people that Authorize.Net does not employ or manage.
Information Collection and Use
Authorize.Net collects personally identifiable information when you register for an Authorize.Net account, and when you use certain Authorize.Net products and services.
Authorize.Net may also receive personally identifiable information from its resellers and other business partners.
When you register with Authorize.Net, we ask for your contact information (such as your name, street address and email address), as well as certain information pertaining to your business, along with billing information such as a bank account and/or credit card number.
==========
In the course of processing a payment transaction, we typically receive from the merchant or a financial institution information related to the transaction.
This normally includes information about the payment that a consumer has furnished the merchant or financial institution in placing the order.
We do not acquire any information directly from consumers through the www.authorize.net Web site.
==========
The personally identifiable information we acquire in processing payment transactions varies according to the nature of the transaction and the way in which merchants or financial institutions are using our payment services.
It may include, for example, the amount of the transaction, the consumer’s name, credit card number and expiration date, checking account number, billing address, and shipping address.
Authorize.Net uses the information collected to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing, and otherwise deliver the payment gateway services.
We may also send merchants service announcements, newsletters, and periodic notices about specials, new products and services and products and services offered by Authorize.Net business partners.
==========
Personally identifiable consumer information is used to process payment transactions and for no other purpose.
Authorize.Net does not offer services or sell products to children.
Authorize.Net does not request or knowingly collect personally identifiable contact information from anyone under the age of 13.
