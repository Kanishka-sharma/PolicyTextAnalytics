This Privacy Notice has been designed to inform you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data.
N Technologies Oy (“N.Rich”, “we”, “us”, “our”) will be transparent with you about why and how we collect personal data.
This Privacy Notice applies to personal information that we receive while we operate as a “controller” or as a “processor” under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) pr as a “business” or a “service provider” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
Please note that this Privacy Notice may be revised and reissued from time to time.
You should visit this page regularly to review the latest version.
==========
In brief
N.Rich is an Account-Based Marketing platform that serves targeted advertising towards businesses on behalf of our clients or targeted advertising of our own.
We process both personal- and behavioural data in order to enable serving advertising and content that is more relevant for your work and professional interests.
We use cookies and similar technologies and you can opt-out at any time.
What we do
We are N Technologies Oy, a Finnish company providing an Account-Based Advertising and Account-Based Analytics software platform to companies operating in the Business-to-Business (B2B) environment.
==========
What this means is that we help our clients to reach their potential and existing business customers easily and accurately using targeted advertising.
Such targeted advertising may be displayed for example on various third-party websites, such as forbes.com or reuters.com that distribute programmatic advertising, through our partners such as Google, or on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Linkedin or Twitter.
We also help our clients to analyze the impact of their digital marketing to make it more relevant and effective.
==========
In order to offer our service, we process three types of data; (i) “pseudonymised” data that alone can’t be associated with the end-user, such as IP-address or unique user identifiers, (ii) direct personal data that can be associated with the end-user such as name, email address or phone number, and (iii) online and offline activity data that may be associated with the two categories of personal data described above and may be used for creating personal behavioural profile of the end-user for marketing, sales and analytics purposes.
We process end-user personal and behavioural data in the business or professional role related to an organisation such as a company.
We do not have any interest in processing or understanding the end-user data or behaviour in “consumer mode” related to a non-business or professional role.
==========
Since it is often impossible to separate professional and “consumer mode data”, we are typically forced to process “consumer mode” data as well.
Whenever possible, we take active steps to avoid processing “consumer mode” data.
We gather personal and activity data using three primary methods; (i) through a small piece of code called N.Rich Tag deployed on third party and our client websites, (ii) through integrations to our clients’ other software systems, and (iii) through our clients importing such data into the N.Rich software.
==========
We use cookies and similar technologies to store unique end-user identifiers into your web browser.
Cookies are used to ensure that we or our clients reach the right end-users with advertising and the advertising content the end-users see will be relevant.
We also use cookies for maintaining a consistent profile of the end-users and their activities enabling serving personalised advertising or content, and for providing analytics related to the activities and potential interest of the end-users towards our-, or our clients’ business offering.
More information about the cookies used by N.Rich is available here.
==========
If you use a Google, Facebook, Linkedin or Twitter account, these platforms may – depending on the settings saved in your account – link your web and app browser history with your personal account and use information from your personal account in order to personalise advertisements.
You can find more detailed information on this matter from: Google’s Privacy Statement, Facebook’s Data Usage Policy, Linkedin Privacy Policy, and from Twitter’s Privacy Policy

Your separate consent (when legally and/or contractually required): For example, when we enable our clients to use Google Ads for remarketing (i.e. connecting with you based on your previous interactions with a website, advertising or application), we make sure we have obtained your consent for the use of your personal data for personalization of ads through the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework.
