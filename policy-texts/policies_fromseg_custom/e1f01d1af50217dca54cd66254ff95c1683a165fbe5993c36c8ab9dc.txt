Facebook on Friday confirmed that it will soon introduce changes to its privacy policies intended to make them easier to understand, though it's unlikely the move will include the sweeping changes some privacy advocates have requested.
"The messages we've received are pretty clear.
==========
Users appreciate having precise and comprehensive controls, but want them to be simpler and easier to use.
They also like the new programs we have rolled out, but want simple and easy ways to opt out of sharing personal information with applications and Web sites through Facebook Platform," a Facebook spokesman said in a statement.

"We're listening to this input and incorporating it into innovations we hope to announce shortly."
The company did not provide details on when this announcement would be made, but said it has "spent the last couple of weeks" listening to user feedback and meeting with experts in California, Washington, D.C., and around the world.

"We know Facebook is well known for its innovations around sharing and we want to be equally known for innovations around user control," the spokesman said.
The most recent concerns about Facebook's privacy policies date back to December, when the company rolled out new privacy settings intended to give users more control over their settings.
But given Facebook's move toward a more open format as it integrates status updates with search engines like Google and Bing, the site encouraged its users to make more of their data public, and made some of the default settings more open.

That prompted nearly a dozen privacy and consumer organizations to ask the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate.
The FTC later said the inquiry was of "particular interest" to them, but the agency has not taken any action.

Last month, at its annual f8 developer conference, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed an "open graph" that would connect the social graphs created by users on sites like Yelp or Pandora and combine them for a larger, more social picture.
That prompted members of Congress, privacy watchdogs, and the Article 29 Working Party to express their concern about the new policies, though again, no definitive action has been taken.
==========
Many detractors are requesting that Facebook provide users with a better explanation of how their information is being used, and gain express consent from members before rolling out new features.
Recently, two Toronto-based Facebook users set up a Web site at quitfacebookday.com, urging other Facebook users to cancel their accounts on May 31.
"For us it comes down to two things: fair choices and best intentions.
==========
In our view, Facebook doesn't do a good job in either department," Matthew Milan and Joseph Dee wrote on the site.
"Facebook gives you choices about how to manage your data, but they aren't fair choices, and while the onus is on the individual to manage these choices, Facebook makes it damn difficult for the average user to understand or manage this.
We also don't think Facebook has much respect for you or your data, especially in the context of the future."
Milan and Dee suggest Ning, Orkut, or Akoha as alternatives, though Ning recently announced that it would be phasing out its free service, so that might not be the best alternative to Facebook.
