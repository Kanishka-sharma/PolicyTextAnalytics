1.
Overview
CivicPlus (referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”) takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously and we are committed to protecting your personal privacy.
CivicPlus has developed this policy regarding our privacy practices (“Privacy Policy”) to explain the manner in which CivicPlus may collect, use, retain, process, and share the personal information collected from users (“you”, “your”, or each a "User") of any of the CivicPlus solutions and associated services (each, a “Solution”; collectively, the “Solutions”), and the CivicPlus website (the “Site”).
The User’s personal information is any information relating to an identified or identifiable person (“Personal Information”), such as your name, address, email address, phone number, or IP address.
Personal Information does not include publicly available information, de-identified, or aggregate consumer data.
This Privacy Policy is designed to help the User obtain information about our privacy practices and to help the User understand its privacy choices when using a Solution or visiting the Site.
By using the Solutions, providing Personal Information, or visiting our Site you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
CivicPlus provides the software solutions directly to our public sector clients (“Clients”) to enable them to serve and perform their own governmental and business functions.
As such, most of the Personal Information we collect and store is in connection with the software and services we provide to our Clients pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them.
==========
In these cases, CivicPlus is acting as a “data custodian” only.
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of Personal Information gathered when you are using or accessing any Solution or the Site.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control or certain data collected by our Clients for their specific purposes and needs, as further described herein.
2.
==========
Client Data
When CivicPlus makes the Solutions available for use by a Client, we do so under a contractual arrangement with our Client pursuant to which the Client, not CivicPlus, makes the decisions about what Personal Information is collected and how it is processed in the Solutions.
Our Clients may electronically submit Personal Information to a Solution, or solicit from you Personal Information within a Solution, for processing and storage purposes (“Client Data”), including, for example, information required to set up admin rights for a Client’s employees, or Personal Information collected from a Client’s constituent who is using the Solution to pay for recreational programming.
In these interactions, the Client’s employees or constituents are “End Users”.
We function as a service provider and may store or process Client Data only for the purpose of providing the Solutions, improving the Solutions, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, or as may be required by law.
==========
If your Personal Information has been submitted to us by one of our Clients and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, rectify, or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant Client directly.
Since CivicPlus is the data custodian to our Clients, who are the “data owners”, CivicPlus cannot modify or delete any data owned by our Clients without such Clients specific request and approval.

==========
What Personal Information Do We Collect?
We may collect Personal Information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit the Site, use a Solution, register an account on any Solution, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Solutions.
Users may register for an account within the Solutions and be asked for Personal Information, as appropriate, including name, email address, physical address, and phone number.
Users may, however, visit the Solutions anonymously.
Users can always refuse to supply Personal Information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Solution related activities, like registering for or obtaining the full benefit of the services provided by the Solution or receiving subscription emails.
==========
At the request and direction of Clients, CivicPlus may collect the following categories of Personal Information:

User-provided personal identifying data: Most of the information we collect is information that Users input directly when using a Solution, such as name and contact details (email, phone number, address, social media handle), physical location, and user-provided content, depending on the Solution used and how the User decides to use it.
User-initiated information: When a User uses text messaging, email or social media to contact or submit notifications to a Client through any Solution, we will collect that User’s phone number, email address, or social media handle, as appropriate.
Website visitor information: When you visit a Solution or the Site, we may collect information about your visit, depending on the Solution, such as your IP address, cookies, location and the pages you visited and when you use the Solution, we may collect information on how you use the Solution.
Protected sensitive data: For certain Solutions, Users are asked for certain information used in relation to applying for job positions or board or committee, certain sensitive data may be collected, such as date of birth, gender, ethnicity, political party, education, job history, references, it is the sole discretion of the Client to request or require these fields.
Financial information: If a User decides to purchase a paid service through a Solution, the User provides financial information related to your payment method including credit card number, credit card type, card expiration date, or other financial information.
==========
We do not, however, capture, store, or transmit that financial That information is provided directly to and stored by the Client’s third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”).
The Payment Processor’s applicable Terms of Service and Privacy Statement govern the use and storage of that information.

Applicant data: Users applying for jobs or elected or appointed seats through a Solution, may be requested to submit prior job information, such as salaries, employment history, education history, address history, employers, social security number, USCIS or alien registration number, passport number, and other application data, as well as driver’s license information, as determined necessary by our Client.
Employee data: Users whose employers are a Client for human resources services may be requested to submit bank account and routing numbers, dependent’s names and social security number, current job title, and other information an employer may request.
Physical image: Certain Solutions may include the ability to upload video or image files which may contain visual representations of any Users that have attend public meetings or been in a public space.
Information related to your mobile device: We may collect and store information related to your mobile device, such as your phone number, location, or device identifier used to deliver push notifications.
You will have a choice as to whether we collect and store this information.
==========
With the exception of the Website Visitor Information, the categories of data above are collected only when certain features and uses of the Solution are procured by the CivicPlus Client, and data collected may vary for each User depending on our Client’s use of the Solution.
All data fields are voluntary for the User to fill in, unless our Client requires certain data to be input by the User.

==========
How We Collect, Receive, and Retain Personal Information?
We collect most of this Personal Information directly from Users willingly inputting such information, whether by webform, text, email, submission of documentation, or telephone call to our Client.
However, we may also collect information from cookies on our Site or Solutions.
We may receive Personal Information from third parties that integrate with our Solutions, at the request of our Clients.
We will retain Personal Information as requested and required by our Client, with whom you share your Personal Information.
We retain Personal Information indefinitely, retention depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data, our Client’s subscription term for the Solution, open records laws, and direction for the retention or deletion of such data.
==========
We may retain Personal Information beyond the Client relation if required by law, contract, or if it is in our legitimate business interests and not prohibited by law.
If you have created a user portal account (“Account”) within a Solution which has been closed, we may take steps to mask Personal Information and other information, but we reserve our ability to retain and access the de-identified data for so long as required to comply with applicable laws.
