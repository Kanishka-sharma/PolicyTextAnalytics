Three privacy-focused browsers compared
Which is the safest browser?
In terms of privacy, the answer may be Internet Explorer.
According to NSS Labs' 2013 Browser Security Comparative Analysis: Privacy (PDF), Internet Explorer tops Firefox and Chrome by blocking most third-party cookies by default and offering a built-in tracking protection list.
In terms of security, the answer may be Firefox.
When Mark Stockley of the Sophos Naked Security blog polled readers last September about which browser they considered the most secure, Firefox was the big winner, gleaning more than 50 percent of the votes, followed by Chrome with just under 27 percent and IE with … Read more
How to delete and disable your Google location history
I had location history enabled for Google Maps and didn't know it.
==========
I found it interesting to see which spots Google logged for me over the past week or month, and I don't plan on disabling the service.
It's nice to know, however, that I can delete portions of my location history or all of it, as well as disable the feature from tracking me in the future.
To see if you have location history enabled, head to the Google Maps Location history page.
Click the gear-icon button to access History settings.

Here, you can choose to … Read more
Free Firefox add-on graphs the trackers
Like most people, my knee-jerk response to tracking cookies is that they are evil and must be banished from my computer.
Then again, blocking cookies doesn't necessarily prevent sites from tracking you.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Micah Lee explained in a June blog post on Deeplinks that when you open a Web page, your browser retrieves elements from many third-party servers.
For example, if the page has a Facebook Like button, JavaScript and images are loaded from Facebook's servers.

The request your browser sends to each server includes your IP address and other information that could identify … Read more

The private information Facebook now makes public
You may have been one of the many Facebook users contacted by the company last week about the demise of the "Who can look up your Timeline by name" search setting.
The Facebook e-mail announcing the discontinuation of the feature goes on to explain how to limit what information you share on the service.
Unfortunately, there's no longer a way to limit globally the personal information Facebook shares with everyone; you can do so only for each separate post using the audience selector.

The Facebook Help Center states the following:

Free online encrypted notepad keeps it simple
The biggest knock on the encryption offered by many cloud storage services is that the company itself can decrypt the data.
The free ProtectedText encrypted online notepad claims it can't decrypt the text you save on its servers.
In addition, ProtectedText requires no registration, and the company promises not to track you.
Nor does it display any ads, which do their own tracking.
Lack of a business model aside, the new service appears to have a lot going for it.
You devise the text file's URL: protectedtext.com/[anyURLnotalreadytaken].

This gives you a second level of protection atop … Read more
How to opt out of some targeted Google ads
Google might be the king of online ads, but it still gives you a way to limit how some of your data is used to sell you things you don't need.
With its new Shared Endorsements coming on November 11, Google will make the ads you see more personalized by referencing your Google+ username, profile photo, and implied endorsements via comments and +1s.
Short of an ad-blocker, there's not much you can do to avoid ads completely.
But Google does provide a few controls for restricting how much of your online behavior shows up in ads.

How to deal with the new Facebook search settings
This week Facebook has reminded us it's putting an end to the ability to hide your profile from its Graph Search.
In the past, users were given the choice to allow other users to search for their profile by name on Facebook, or to hide their profile from the search.
For those of you who are still using this feature, you'll see reminders over the next few weeks as the setting is removed from the service altogether.

So with users sure to be upset that anyone and everyone will be able to find them on Facebook by simply … Read more
Enhance privacy by being deliberately inaccurate
When I go to the local sandwich shop, I don't care whether the person taking my order knows my birthday or my mother's maiden name.
So why does Google or some other Web site I register with need to know so much about me?
==========
Especially considering the company is likely to barter and sell the information to third parties, who aggregate, analyze, repackage, and resell it.
There's nothing new about purposely providing false information when registering for a Web service -- from a simple throwaway e-mail address all the way to a phony name.

How to set up two-step verification for Evernote
Two months after introducing two-factor verification to its Premium account users, Evernote has made it available for all users.
With this security feature enabled, you will need to enter your password along with a verification code sent to your mobile phone in order to log in to your account.
==========
What this means is that if someone gets a hold of your Evernote password, this nefarious individual would also need to be in possession of your phone to access your data.
To enable two-factor verification, log on to your account and go to Evernote's Security section.
