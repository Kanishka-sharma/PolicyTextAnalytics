We understand your concern about how information about you is used and shared.
We have prepared this Privacy Policy to let you know about our policy regarding information that is collected on our website located at www.viglink.com (the “Site”) and through your use of our software (the “Software”) and services (the “Services”).
Last updated: May 29, 2018

Information That You Give Us That is Covered by the Privacy Policy
Personal Data
VigLink collects personally identifiable data from publishers, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, and login IP address when you voluntarily choose to register for use of the Software or Service, subscribe to marketing communications from us, and when you contact us with comments or inquiries.
If you are the publisher of a website and are registering to use the Software and Service, we may also collect your bank account and/or credit card information that you may provide to us upon request.
Passively Collected Information
When you interact with us through the Site, we receive and store certain additional information automatically.
==========
In some regions, including the European Economic Region, collected information might be classified as personally identifiable under applicable data protection laws.
Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
==========
Examples include IP addresses, browser types, domain names, device identification numbers and other anonymous statistical data involving your use of the Site, the Software and/or the Services.
Cookies
In operating the Site, we may use a technology called “cookies.”
A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts the Site gives to your computer when you access the Site.
==========
Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.
In addition, we may install the Software on third party websites.
In doing so, the Software will place a cookie on the computers of users of those third party websites and will potentially collect personally identifiable information about your browser, IP address, and your activity at such websites.
==========
On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar.
Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse the Site; however certain areas and features of the Site, require your acceptance of cookies to work properly.
==========
If you choose to use cookies, we may collect personally identifiable information without your prior permission.
VigLink and third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads on sites across the Internet based on someone’s past visits to the VigLink website.
These ads, often referred to as “remarketing,” may be personalized using information inferred from their behavior when visiting VigLink’s website.
For example, if a visitor views their VigLink dashboard, then we may later show them ads promoting recent updates to our products or services that would be relevant to existing customers.
The intention behind our use of remarketing is to provide VigLink the opportunity to show more relevant ads and not to obtain personally identifiable information.
==========
Users can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and opt out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting Google’s Ads Preferences Manager.
Users may also wish to install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
==========
Use of Personally Identifiable Information
We use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
If you provide personally identifiable data for a certain reason, we may use such information in connection with the reason for which it was provided.
For instance, we will use the personally identifiable information provided by users of the Software in order to make payment of eligible commissions.
==========
We also use personally identifiable information and personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site and use of the Software and Services to help us improve the Site, Software and Services, and to better understand our users.
If we intend on using any personally identifiable information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the personally identifiable information is collected.
Use of Personally Non-Identifiable Data
We may use personally non-identifiable information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Site and users of the Software and Service, the number of visitors to each page of the Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers.
No personally identifiable information is available or used in this process.
==========
Date Protection Rights
You have the right to access their personal data, rectify inaccurate or incorrect personal data, erase collected or stored personal data, restrict future processing of personal data, request portability of personal data, object to VigLink’s processing of personal data, and object to automated decision or profiling.
You can restrict future processing of your personal data using VigLink’s Opt-out functionality.
You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority about VigLink’s collection and use of your personal data.
To file a complaint about VigLink’s data collection or processing, please contact your relevant data protection authority.
You have the right to opt-out of VigLink marketing communications at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails that VigLink distributes.
If VigLink is collecting and/or processing your personal data based on given consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of data processed prior to withdrawal nor will it affect the processing of personal data based on legal grounds other than consent.
==========
VigLink will respond to all data rights requests received in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Data Transfer
Your personal data may be transferred by VigLink to, and/or processed in, countries other than the country in which it was collected or you reside.
The applicable data laws of the countries your personal data is transferred to, and/or processed in, may have data laws and regulations that differ from the laws and regulations of your country.
==========
These laws might not be as protective as the data laws of the country you reside in or the country where the data was collected.
In such instances where data will be transferred to a country other than the country it was collected in, VigLink will take reasonable safety and security measures to ensure that your personal data will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
==========
Sharing Information
We are not in the business of selling personally identifiable information.
We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.
There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share personally identifiable information with certain third parties without notice to you including those set forth below:
Agents, Consultants, and Related Third Parties
We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions.
Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments.
==========
When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only as necessary to provide us with designated services.
Legal Requirements
We may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.
==========
Business Transfers
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.
In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personally identifiable information may be part of the transferred assets.
==========
Informal Notices and Bulletins
Periodically, we may choose to send news, bulletins, educational materials, marketing materials, or other information to you, and will use personally identifiable information to send such communications.
You can opt-out of VigLink marketing communications at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails that VigLink distributes.
Legal Basis for Collecting and Processing Personal Data
VigLink’s legal grounds for the collection and processing of personal data will depend on the nature of the data collection and the purpose for its use.
VigLink normally collects personal data where the user has given explicit consent, where the collection and processing of personal data are in the legitimate interest of VigLink, or where VigLink has a contractual obligation to do so.
In some instances, VigLink might have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you.
In the event that we request you provide personal data to comply with legal requirements, we will disclose this at the relevant time and notify you whether providing said personal data is mandatory.
==========
Your Choices
You can always choose not to provide personally identifiable information to us.
However, doing so may prevent you from obtaining certain information or using certain areas of the Site, the Software and the Services.
==========
Children
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
If you are under 13, please do not give us any personally identifiable information.
We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personally identifiable information on the Internet without their permission.
If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
==========
Links to Other Web Sites
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site, the Software and the Service.
It does not apply to information collected by third party sites or products or services that may be accessible through the Site, the Software or the Services.
We suggest that you contact those third parties directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies.
==========
Security
We take commercially reasonable steps designed to protect personally identifiable information and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
The steps we implement are designed to provide a level of security commensurate with the risk of processing your personal data.
Personal data is stored on secure, firewall-protected servers that are located in secure facilities.
==========
However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error-free.
Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personally identifiable information to us or to any other party via the Internet.
==========
User Data
VigLink provides publishers with the ability to automatically affiliate their commercial links to merchant destinations and gain insights into the behavior of consumers that visit their sites.
VigLink facilitates publisher affiliation and monetization by converting existing, direct links to merchant destinations into affiliates links or by inserting new affiliate links to merchant destinations on relevant, commercial keywords contained within publishers’ site content.
Additionally, VigLink allows publishers to create “Anywhere” links they can place on their site, software, and mobile applications or distribute to third-party properties.
==========
When a user clicks through VigLink affiliated links to a commercial destination and then makes a purchase or submits a lead, the publisher that generated the traffic is paid a referral fee or commission.
VigLink processes and stores users’ IP addresses, which are used to determine users’ approximate geographical location.
VigLink may use geographical information to optimize links, determine the best merchant destination for clicks, and the appropriate language and region for click destinations.
==========
VigLink also processes and stores user device data like device type, device id, browser agent, and browser type when a user visits a VigLink enabled site or clicks on a VigLink affiliated link.
Browser and device data helps VigLink to optimize our service to suit browser and device functionality as well as identify the browser and device compatibility issues.
VigLink’s use of user IP addresses, browser, and device data helps us to prevent noncompliance, recognize automated, non-human activity, and prevent violations of our publisher code of conduct.
==========
VigLink uses cookies and/or device identifiers to collect and store this information.
Please refer to VigLink’s Cookie Disclosure for more information on the cookies VigLink uses and the third parties VigLink works with.
VigLink does not make an effort to distinguish the specific identity of users.
==========
If you want VigLink to cease collecting or storing personal data about the websites you visit, the links you click, or the merchants you make purchases from, you can choose to opt-out out of VigLink cookies using our opt-out page.
Opting out of VigLink cookies will result in VigLink ceasing to place identifying cookies on your device when you browse VigLink enabled websites and/or links.
Opting out of VigLink tracking requires that a cookie is placed on your computer so that we know not to track your activity.
Clearing your browser’s cache or cookies will remove this cookie, and you will be required to opt-out of tracking again.
Similarly, if you access sites that use VigLink from a different browser or device than the browser or device you opted out of tracking on, you will be required to opt-out again.
==========
VigLink will retain personal data for up to 15 years.
After that, VigLink will either delete or anonymize user data.
If deletion or anonymization isn’t possible due to storage in backup archives, VigLink will ensure that backup data storage has a reasonable level security and will restrict it from further processing until deletion is feasible.
==========
Publisher Data
VigLink collects personally identifiable information from publishers, such as your name, primary contact information, physical address, telephone number, email address, websites, software, mobile applications, log in IP addresses, and banking, tax, payment, and/or VAT information when you voluntarily choose to register for use of the Software or Service, subscribe to marketing communications from us, and when you contact us with comments or inquiries.
We also collect information about when and how a publisher uses the publisher dashboard and the VigLink support center.
Publisher personal data is used to review eligibility for participation in the VigLink network, to remit payment for commissions earned, to facilitate marketing and support communications, to provide performance insights, and to improve the service we provide publishers based on your usage of our tools, dashboard, and site.
Publishers have the ability to update most personal data you provide through your publisher dashboard settings.
