The Use of appTV’s Services
appTV provides advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile and regular websites and/or apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”), and service providers and other data partners (collectively “Partners”).
We do this by using appTV’s technology stack (the “Technology Stack”, or the “Technology”).
We use appTV’s Technology and other tools to deliver advertising to End Users, and we, in turn, provide our Services to help Clients (and their own customers) to deliver ads that are of interest to the End Users.
We explain in [Section 3] below, entitled “Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDK’s” how cookies and similar technologies (which we also use) work.
==========
a. Information collected through the appTV Technology stack
Through the appTV Technology Stack, we may (but do not necessarily or always) collect a variety of information about End Users (whether through our ad server or through other partnerships and tools such as Client-facing APIs), including:
IP addresses, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information such as information about End Users’ operating system;
Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs (collectively, “Mobile IDs”).
These Mobile IDs may be associated with other information we collect through the appTV Technology Stack, from third parties, or through any other services we offer;
Apps that you have installed, mobile websites that you have interacted with, and how you interact with them, including whether and how you interact with ads (including time-stamp information);
Device type and other device information (e.g., whether you are using a smartphone or tablet, and related information);
Mobile browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, and Chrome);
Mobile Carrier ASN (autonomous system number) / Network provider;
Other unique identifiers that may be associated with an End Users’ device, including identifiers provided by clients or their service providers; and we may combine and merge the various types of information collected from the appTV Ad Services, and may also enhance it (or permit our Clients to enhance it) with information collected from third parties.
We refer to all of the above information as the “Service Information.”
b.
==========
How we use the information collected by the appTV technology stack
We use the data collected to provide a variety of services to our Clients related to advertising and marketing, including services we may describe elsewhere on our websites.
This includes the use of the Service Information for purposes such as to:
Provide and improve the appTV ad targeting.
This includes, for example, providing customer technical and operational support for these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity, and resolving disputes and enforcing our terms and conditions and other rights we may have.
This may also include analyzing, customizing, and improving the features of the appTV technology stack;
Provide information and analytics to clients about the use of app features provided through the appTV technology, or help Clients create or enhance user profiles for marketing or analytics purposes;
Develop and use data models that try to predict End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis or across devices, using the site/app related content category(Not  based on end user data);
Analyze ad performance and fraud detection, for example, by attributing End Users’ app installations or mobile web visits to ad campaigns;
Combine the service Information to perform (including by working with Clients and Partners) any of the above functions, or other advertising, marketing, or analytics services.
Or, we may aggregate and create data models to do this, by creating algorithms in order to predict common interests among End Users.
This may be done, for example, to target advertising or provide analytics to other parties.
==========
We or our Clients may use commonly used information-gathering tools such as cookies and deploy online cookies to track End Users across mobile websites and/or apps, or to associate End Users and these cookies with Mobile IDs.
We or our Clients may perform such functions to resolve End Users’ identities across mobile devices and to better or more accurately target relevant ads to End Users.
We may also append or combine certain elements of the data (such as hashed advertising ID’s) to other information provided by third-party data providers, to learn more about End Users or to provide advertising and analytics services.
You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, in [Section 3] below, entitled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDK’s”
In any case, we do not keep raw data (Mobile IDs level) for more than 60 days of last interaction with our Technology Stack.
c.
==========
How we share data we collect by the appTV technology stack
Generally, we share the data with Clients and Partners in order to improve their advertising targeting.
For example, we share data with:
• Clients and their marketing and service providers, so they may provide targeted content and advertising to End Users on mobile websites and/or apps;
• Other third parties that target advertising.
This may include, for example, analytics companies’ data management platforms that help marketers maintain and use data, proximity solution providers, and other advertising technology providers.
These companies may, for example, provide targeted content and advertising to End Users and others on third-party mobile websites and/or apps;
• Clients and their marketing and service providers, to help measure the effectiveness of marketing or analyze their End Users’ likely interests or demographics;
• Partners to enhance consumer privacy, hash information, or send advertising offers by email or display advertising (which may be linked to a cookie as described above); and Third-party platforms to help advertisers identify common users across different mobile devices and/or mobile browsers.
The processes we described above often involve cookies or similar technologies, which may be associated with other information about End Users, such as End Users’ interests, demographics, or transactions.
==========
This is generally known as “interest-based advertising.”
We encourage individuals who are interested in controlling or learning about this type of advertising to go to [section 4] below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options,” or go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) website at www.aboutads.info.
We may also share Service Information with third parties:
Pursuant to a request or authorization by an End User or Client;
If the disclosure is provided to (a) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement; (b) enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements; or (c) protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity;
Where the information is aggregated or de-identified; and As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence).

Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs
a. Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as unique browser identifiers.
Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your browser.
Our servers may deploy a cookie on your browser when you visit our websites.
Our Clients and Partners may do likewise on our websites, our Clients’ and Partners’ websites, and elsewhere.
==========
appTV may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
Persistent cookies, unlike session cookies, remain after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to any given website.
Using persistent cookies, a site operator (or a third party they work with) can “remember” what you have previously done on a website and personalize the site, or ads you see, for you.
This technology may also provide a site operator or third party (or us, when you visit the appTV Websites) with information regarding your IP address, browser type, the web pages that you visit just before or after visiting a website, the web pages viewed, and the dates and times of your visits.
==========
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.
When you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or Partners, to set or read cookies.
Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device.
If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit.
==========
We, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, for example, “remember” you, track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising.
We and our Clients and Partners use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.
==========
If you wish to opt out of interest-based mobile advertising, please see  [section 4] below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of our websites’ functionalities and offerings, and those of other websites you visit.
==========
b. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We, or our Clients or Partners, may use or work with mobile SDKs, which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our technology stack.
The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
We may use this technology, for example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.
If you would like to opt out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in  [section 4] below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
Our Clients or Partners may use the above technologies (sometimes, in combination with each other or other data such as IP addresses or hashed or de-identified data files) to coordinate identifiers across platforms, browsers, or devices, in order to more efficiently analyze or target advertising.
4.
==========
Consumer control and OPT-OUT options
Consumers have the control whether or not they would like to receive relevant ads and marketing email from our Clients.
a. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising
You can opt out of many of the platforms and service providers we work with that support online interest-based advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info (or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are located in the European Union).
This type of opt-out is cookie-based, which means that if you replace or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again.
Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads; rather, the ads you see will be less customized to you.
==========
b. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising
1.
End users can opt out of all targeted advertising on their device by ENABLING THE LAT SETTING (this setting is per device only).
When the end user enables the LAT flag, they are opted out of targeted or interest-based ads only i.e. the end user will continue to see ads after the LAT flag is turned on, but these ads will not be “targeted” to that end user.
==========
End users should be aware that developers, including appTV, are bound by the platform’s terms to honor end-user opt-outs for interest-based or location-based ads (e.g. Apple or Google’s developer terms).
• for details on how to opt out of interest-based ads on Google, visit Google’s support site:
https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en
• for details on how to opt out of interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit Microsoft’s support site:

• for details on how to opt-out of interest-based ads on iTunes, visit Apple’s support site:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074
2.
End users can also “reset” the data being used to target ads to them – for example, if the end user is being served ads tied to past activities that are no longer relevant to their interests.
This is accomplished by the end user “RESETTING” THEIR AD IDENTIFIER ON THEIR DEVICE.
Ad identifiers include the IDFA (iPhone), Google Ad ID (Android) and Advertising ID (Windows).
• for more details on resetting the IDFA on iOS, visit:

3.
End users can also OPT OUT THROUGH THE APP itself if an app specific opt-out is provided.
4.
==========
End users can also OPT OUT OF PUSH NOTIFICATIONS from an app using the appropriate settings within the app.
• Push notifications are opt-in on the iPhone and Windows platform, and opt-out on the Android platform.
• You can learn more about push notifications in this guide from the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) in France –
http://www.mmaglobal.com/files/push_notification_mma_france.pdf
Opting out of specific features in the appTV does not opt out the end user from other ad reporting or attribution functions in the appTV (e.g. Attribution Analytics) or other analytics or tracking software.
==========
Furthermore, none of the opt out mechanisms listed here will change an end user’s email or advertising settings, nor will it prevent the collection or use of the end user’s personal information by other parties not covered by these opt out mechanisms.
To opt out of third party emails or other advertising, please use the appropriate unsubscribe links or contact the responsible party directly.
