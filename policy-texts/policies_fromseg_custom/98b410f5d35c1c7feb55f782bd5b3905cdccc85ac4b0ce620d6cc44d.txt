ABOUT PAYMENT AND VIRTUAL CURRENCY
If you purchase products or services through the Zedge platform, you will be asked to provide billing information (e.g., name, billing address, credit card information) to the third-party payment processor designated by Zedge (“Payment Processor”).
Zedge may change the designated Payment Processor from time to time.
You warrant that all such billing information is complete and accurate, and that you are authorized to use such account information for such payments.
==========

You acknowledge that you may be separately required to accept the Payment Processor’s own terms governing use of its services in the manner it specifies.
==========
We may offer you the ability to purchase a subscription for an ad-free Zedge experience.
When you purchase this subscription, you understand that it is a membership that automatically renews itself every year indefinitely without action.
Zedge will charge the then-current annual membership fee to the billing account that you designated as your preference, or if you have not designated a preference, to the payment mechanisms, such as a debit or credit card, most recently used on the Services.
==========
The benefits of your subscription will be suspended unless and until payment is received, provided payment is received within 25 days.

We make no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of the services or merchandise that are connected with the use of Virtual Currency.
The price for content will be displayed at the point of purchase.
Using your Virtual Currency to access content grants you a limited license to access certain features on the Zedge platform when, as, and if allowed by us.
All Virtual Currency transactions are final and we do not offer refunds for such transactions.
We are not responsible for repairing or replacing content, or providing you with any credit or refund in the event that we modify, suspend, or terminate the Virtual Currency program, or for loss or damage due to any service error, or any other reason.
Purchases of Virtual Currency may not be sub-licensed and are non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are revoked or discontinued.
We may change the purchase price for Virtual Currency or for accessing content at any time, as well as the ways you can use Virtual Currency.
We reserve the right to suspend, revoke, or stop issuing Virtual Currency or permitting their use at any time without notice, refund, or compensation, and to set expiration dates for Virtual Currency.
==========
Without limiting the foregoing, if your account has been inactive for 180 days or more, or if you have not used your Mobile App for 180 days or more, your Virtual Currency will expire and we may cancel and terminate your Virtual Currency.
We are not required to notify you in advance of these actions, or to provide you any refunds, compensation, or any material or non-material benefit for such expiration, termination and/or cancelation of your Virtual Currency.
Virtual Currency may not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value.
If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, you will lose all accumulated Virtual Currency without refund or other compensation.
You agree that we will have no liability to you based on our exercise of our rights with respect to Virtual Currency.
