When Adobe transfers personal information from customers across national borders, we do so in compliance with applicable law.
How does Adobe transfer your personal information?
For our individual users and customers whose use of Adobe websites and apps results in the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to non-EEA countries, we rely on one or more of the following legal mechanisms: Standard Contractual Clauses, the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and consent of the individual.

How does Adobe transfer personal information on behalf of our business customers?
For our business customers whose use of Adobe solutions results in the transfer of personal information from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to non-EEA countries, Adobe relies on Standard Contractual Clauses and adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable.
Adobe has prepared a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) that includes the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
If you are an Adobe business customer (with Enterprise Licensing) and want to enter into a DPA and SCCs with Adobe, please request those documents from us.

Adobe Privacy Shield certification
Adobe Inc. (our U.S. company) has certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States.
Although the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield have been ruled invalid for the transfer of data, where personal information has already been transferred to the U.S. on the basis of the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, we will continue to protect personal information from the EU, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland according to the standards of the Privacy Shield and applicable EU law.

As described in the Privacy Policy, for individual users who reside outside of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, which is the “data controller” with regard to EU personal information collected by Adobe.
Your personal information may be transferred to Adobe Inc. (Adobe U.S.) as described above.
With respect to personal information processed on behalf of our EEA, United Kingdom, and Swiss business customers, under EU privacy laws, Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited (Adobe Ireland) is generally considered a “data processor.”
For example, an EEA business customer may use Adobe Sign to process documents containing names, email addresses, and other personal information about its consumers.
As part of Adobe providing services to the business customer, this personal information of consumers may be transferred by Adobe Ireland to Adobe U.S. under Standard Contractual Clauses, as described above.

Adobe U.S. complies with the Privacy Shield Principles where it has received personal information from the EEA and Switzerland in reliance on the Privacy Shield.
