                          information is processed and used.

==========
The following policies are in effect for the web pages, 
                          newsletters and opt-in announcement lists owned and 
                          operated by Investopedia Inc, which includes Investopedia.com.
Technical Information Collected
                          Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers known as the "Internet Protocol" IP address.
Like most web servers, when a visitor requests a page from any Web Site within the Investopedia Network our  servers automatically recognize and log that visitor's domain name, IP address, access times, referring web sites, platform, and browser type.
This information reveals nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site.
We   use these logs to provide statistics about our Web site usage in aggregate,  to assist us in the maintenance, design, and operation of our Web site, and to investigate misuse of the Investopedia Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement.
We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals.
==========
Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.
Information on Cookies
                          When using our sites, Investopedia or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer.
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.
A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites.
Cookies do not damage your system.
We use cookies to identify which areas of Investopedia's Network of Web Sites you have visited, personalized or customized, so the next time you visit those pages may be readily accessible.
==========
Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement.
We and our advertisers  may use this information to better personalize the content and promotions that you see on our Site.
You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser.
You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent.
If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other Web sites will not work as intended.
==========
Registration Data
                          Investopedia offers access to services that are free but  that may require registration.
We will use your registration contact information to send notification of Investopedia products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail.
We also may share that information with our clients.
Our clients may send you promotional material that is related to the topic of the service for which you registered unless you have chosen not to receive it.
Investopedia reserves the right to send to our registered members email notices and announcements that may be of interest to Investopedia users.
TO NOT RECEIVE ANY COMMUNICATION FROM Investopedia, MEMBERS SHOULD REQUEST THAT THEIR REGISTRATION BE CANCELLED.
We respect and will honor all requests to correct, erase, or otherwise act in our visitor's wishes in regards to the use of their data.
Email Announcements and Opting-out
                          We will most likely also request your e-mail address  and other personal information for the purposes of providing additional services (for example, subscriptions to email newsletters).
Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested.
==========
You can unsubscribe from our newsletters at the following link or by following the instructions at the bottom of every email.
Through our Web site you may also subscribe to promotional announcements from our partners.
Our site provides users the opportunity to choose or opt-out of receiving communications from Investopedia sites and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
For example, during our newsletter sign up for the newsletter we will ask if it is alright to send these promotional announcements.
If you do not wish to receive the announcements you have the ability to opt-out.
==========
We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.
Advertisers never see your email address, all communication goes through our servers to maintain your privacy.
Third-Party Offers
                                                    Some advertisers we work with are interested in acquiring leads for their sale force by providing offers that qualify visitors.
For example, a brokerage might provide a free book on trading in order to reach and advertise to that audience.
==========
(This is known as cost-per-lead advertising (CPL) or co-registration.)
With third-party offers user data is collected by our webservers and sent to the advertiser who then fulfills the offer.
After data is sent to the advertiser we have no way to control  how it is used  because it has left our system.
We always attempt to deal with reputable companies who  respect user privacy but we cannot guarantee, or be liable for, any misuse of visitor data as a result of a third-party offer on our site.
If you have experienced a problem with one of our advertisers, please tell us.
==========
Single-pixel Images
                          Investopedia and its advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information.
Investopedia does not gather personal information through the use of these images.
Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser.
