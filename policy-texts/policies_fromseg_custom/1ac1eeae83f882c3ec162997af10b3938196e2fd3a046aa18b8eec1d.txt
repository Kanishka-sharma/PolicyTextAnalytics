Do Not Rely on Information Posted
 
The content of the Site is offered for general information, discussion, and entertainment purposes only.
Some of the content is unmoderated and reflects the personal opinions users.
You should be skeptical about any information on the Site because the information may be offensive, harmful, and/or incorrect.
Neither the content of the Site, nor the links to other websites contained therein, are routinely moderated, screened, approved, reviewed, or endorsed by TFE Times or any affiliated person or entity.
We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the information on the Site.
Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk.
We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Site, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents.

This Site may include content provided by third parties, including materials provided by other users, bloggers, and third-party licensors, syndicators, aggregators, and/or reporting services.
All statements and/or opinions expressed in these materials, and all articles and responses to questions and other content, other than the content provided by TFE Times, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity providing those materials.
Such materials do not necessarily reflect the opinion of TFE Times.
We are not responsible, or liable to you or any third party, for the content or accuracy of any materials provided by any third parties.

Age and User Contribution Removal
 
TFE Times is not intended for children under 13 years of age.
If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on the Site or on or through any of its features, register on the Site, use any of the interactive or public comment features on the Site, or provide any information about yourself to us.
See our Privacy Policy for more information about contacting TFE Times if you believe we have collected information from a child under 13.
TFE Times allows minors under the age of 18 years old to access, or become Registered Users of, the Site.
==========
Notwithstanding this, if you are a minor under the age of 18 years old and a Registered User you may request removal of your User Contributions posted on the Site.
To request removal of a User Contribution, you must notify us via email.
When you contact TFE Times to request removal of a User Contribution, we require you to authenticate your status as a Registered User and to identify the particular User Contribution to be removed by providing the (1) URL to the User Contribution, (2) the date and time at which the User Contribution was posted, and (3) the contents of the User Contribution.
If you do not properly notify us, authenticate your status as a Registered User, or properly identify the particular User Contribution to be removed, TFE Times is not required to remove your User Contribution and removal will be in our sole discretion.
Removal of User Contributions from the Site does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your User Contributions from the Site.
TFE Times, in our sole discretion, may retain your User Contributions on our servers in some form.
==========
However, removal will render your User Contribution invisible to other users of the Site.
We may, in our sole discretion, decide to anonymize your User Contribution such that you cannot be individually identified, rather than remove the User Contribution.
In the event your User Contribution is anonymized, it will remain visible to other users of the Site.
TFE Times is not responsible for the removal of User Contributions that are cached, copied, or reposted by third parties.
Likewise, to the extent that any provision of federal or state law requires us to maintain certain User Contributions, we will not remove the User Contribution from the Site.
==========
