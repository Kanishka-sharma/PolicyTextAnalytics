The following sets forth the information gathering and disclosure practices for ANSI Online http://www.ansi.org.
Online Commerce Activity-Customer Data
Customers requesting information, products, and services from ANSI Online may be asked to provide personal data.
ANSI uses this information to process your order and to contact you if necessary to respond to your request.
==========
We may use it to send you additional information about the products and services that we offer.
We give you the option not to receive such further promotional information.
We also provide you a means to review and modify personal information that you have provided to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date, either directly online or by contacting our web site administrator.
==========
Online transactions via the Electronic Standards Store (ESS) utilize a secure server and automated credit or debit card authorization service.
For security reasons, this system will store approval codes, but not credit card numbers.
Credit card information must be re-entered for all future ESS transactions.
The Electronic Standards Store (ESS) utilizes a technology called "cookies" to assist returning shoppers.
==========
Cookies are small bits of data that web servers store on the user's hard drive.
Cookies record information about visits to a particular site, and can only be read back later by the site that created them.
Cookies store data such as a log-in ID and password so that the user only has to enter that data once.
==========
Cookies make it possible to create a "shopping cart" into which the user can place selections before checking out.
With cookies, a user can even log-off half way through a shopping expedition and pick up later at the point where he or she left the transaction.
Though ANSI monitors traffic to its web sites and the pages that are visited, neither "cookies" nor data about individual customers are correlated with viewing habits or shopping preferences.
==========
Contractual agreements between ANSI and a number of its accredited standards developers require ANSI to provide the developer with information concerning customers who have purchased standards developed by that developer.
This information is limited to the customer name, organization and contact information.
That is the extent to which ANSI provides customer data to third parties.
Credit card information is never provided to third parties.
Policy/Technical Activity-Member/Technical Contact Data
Membership rosters posted on ANSI online for the ANSI Board, committees of the Board, and councils, boards and committees of the Institute (except for the U.S. National Committee of the IEC), do not disclose personal data beyond name, title and organization, except when the individual members of these committees, councils or boards agree to the disclosure of their contact information.
In addition to providing ANSI staff contact information, ANSI Online does contain searchable databases providing technical contact information for:
U.S. Participation in ISO Activities and U.S. Participation in ISO/IEC JTC1 Activities
U.S. National Committee of IEC
ANSI Accredited Standards Developers
Quality Systems Registrars accredited by the ANSI Registrar Accreditation Board (RAB)
Environmental Management System Registrars accredited by the ANSI Registrar Accreditation Board (RAB)
ANSI Accredited Certification Programs
For news items, meetings and special event announcements posted on ANSI Online, ANSI may provide contact information for individuals identified as a point of contact to the extent they have agreed to such disclosure.
==========
Persons posting messages to the ASD FAQ site do so voluntarily and are advised that their message and e-mail address may be visible to the public.
Members/Constituents who have questions or concerns relative to the disclosure of their personal information on ANSI Online including its accuracy should contact the appropriate ANSI staff for that activity or the web site administrator.
Questions/Comments
Questions or comments about this privacy statement or our practices may be submitted via e-mail to the web site administrator via our Feedback Page
ANSI Online contains links to other web sites.
ANSI makes no claim regarding nor accepts responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites to which it may link except in cases where ANSI manages the linked web site in which case the privacy practices for that site will be disclosed thereon.
