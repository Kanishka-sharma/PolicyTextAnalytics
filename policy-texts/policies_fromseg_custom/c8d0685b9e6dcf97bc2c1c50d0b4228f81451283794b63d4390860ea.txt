==========
SERVICE
5.1 Service Distinctions.
Our service is not a telecommunications service, and we provide it on a best efforts basis.
There are important distinctions between a telecommunications service and our service.
Our service is subject to different regulatory treatment than a telecommunications service.
This treatment may limit or otherwise affect your rights of redress before regulatory agencies.
Our service requires a high speed broadband connection which we do not provide.
Events beyond our control may affect our service, such as power outages, fluctuations in the Internet, your underlying ISP or broadband service, or maintenance.
We will act in good faith to minimize disruptions to your use of and access to our service.
==========
5.2 Residential Use of Service and Device.
If you subscribe to our residential service plans, we provide you with service and the device solely for single family, normal residential, non-commercial use.
Single family refers to you and those of your immediate family members who reside in your personal residence - e.g., spouse, domestic partner, and/or children.
If you subscribe to a service plan which permits use of more than one device with the same voice line, the basis for assessing such use will not change.
==========
5.3 Small Business Plans.
If you subscribe to any of Vonage's small business plans, we provide our service and the device to you solely for use as a small business user or domestic business traveler.
The following uses are not considered small business uses and are not permitted under small business plans: autodialing; continuous or extensive call-forwarding, inbound/outbound centralized or distributed call center activity, telemarketing of any kind (including, but not limited to, charitable or political solicitation or polling); fax or voicemail broadcasting and fax or voicemail blasting.
(See also Section 10.)
==========
If you subscribe to Business Plus, you are responsible for supplying, operating, and supporting the standard SIP based Customer Premise Equipment for use with the service.
As the subscriber and operator or administrator of this equipment, you are responsible for maintaining the security of the equipment, including but not limited to the physical and network security elements of your device.
5.4 Inconsistent with Normal Use.
If you use the service or the device in a way that is inconsistent with the normal use for your service or plan, you will be required, at Vonage's sole discretion, to pay the rates for the service or plan that would apply to the way you used the service or device, or terminate the plan.
For example, if you subscribe to one of our residential service plans, and your usage is inconsistent with normal residential use, you may thereafter be required to pay our applicable, higher rates for commercial service for all periods in which your use of our service or the device was inconsistent with normal residential use.
==========
Unlimited voice services are provided primarily for continuous live dialog between two individuals.
Lack of continuous dialog activity, unusual call patterns, excessive numbers and/or consistent excessive usage will be considered indicators that use may be inconsistent with normal use, or that impermissible use may be occurring and may trigger an account review or further action by us.
Failure to contact Vonage in response to its notifications and/or failure to promptly correct usage activity to conform to normal use will result, in Vonage's sole discretion, in immediate mandatory transfer to another appropriate plan, suspension or termination of service.
You acknowledge that if your service is terminated under this provision, you are subject to all applicable disconnection and device or other rebate recovery charges.
Vonage's right to terminate your account under Section 6.5(b) (with or no reason) is not limited by this provision.
For a non-exhaustive list of examples of uses of our service inconsistent with normal residential use, click here.
==========
5.5 No 0+ or Operator Assisted Calling;
May Not Support x11 Calling.
Our service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling, including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls.
Our service may not support 311, 511, and other x11 services in one or more service areas.
Our service does support specified dialing such as 911 and 411, which are provided for elsewhere in these Terms of Service.
==========
5.6 No Directory Listing.
The phone numbers you get from us will not be listed in any telephone directories.
However, any phone numbers you transfer from your local phone company may be listed.
==========
5.7 Incompatibility With Other Services.
(a) Non-Voice Equipment Limitations.
You acknowledge that our service may not be compatible with all non-voice communications equipment, including but not limited to home security systems, TTY, medical monitoring equipment, certain versions of TIVo, satellite television systems, PBX, Centrex, other private telephone networks, or computer modems.
==========
You waive any claim against Vonage for interference with or disruption of these services and equipment, as well as any claim that Vonage is responsible for any disruption to your business, if applicable.
(b) Certain Broadband, Cable Modem, and Other Services.
You acknowledge that our service presently is not compatible with AOL cable broadband service and certain versions of TiVO.
==========
There may also be other services with which our service may be incompatible.
Some providers of broadband service may provide modems that prevent the transmission of communications using our service.
We do not warrant that our services will be compatible with all broadband services and expressly disclaim any express or implied warranties regarding the compatibility of our service with any particular broadband service.
==========
5.8 Passwords
  You will be asked to create a password in order to gain access to your account information on-line or when contacting a Vonage agent by phone.
You agree to keep all passwords and account information confidential and are solely responsible for any liability or damages resulting from your failure to maintain that confidentiality, and for all activities that occur under your password.
You must immediately notify us if you suspect any breach of security such as loss, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your password and account.
==========
5.9 Changes to Service Plans
  Your service plan includes terms and conditions such as monthly service allowances, limitations and features, and the associated charges, all as described in the materials made available to you in connection with your order.
You acknowledge that your service plan is also subject to these Terms of Service.
Our service is subject to our business policies, practices and procedures, which we can change at any time without notice.
Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, we can also change the terms and conditions of your service plan (such as features and prices) at any time, with or without notice.
If we do give you notice, it may be provided on your account web page or monthly bill, in a newsletter, in a mailing, by e-mail, by telephone or other communication permitted under applicable law.

If you terminate your service before that period of time expires, then you will be subject to a recovery fee equal to the amount of the promotional or plan benefit that was specified on the date that it was provided to you, less the amount, if any, that you paid for the promotional or plan benefit in connection with your acceptance of same.

See Section 8.8 below.
==========
(b) Disconnection by us without a reason.

==========
(a) Single line Accounts.
You may be able to take, or "port," your current number to another service provider.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
It is important that you read this entire section carefully.
This section provides for resolution of disputes through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
14.1 Arbitration.
==========
Vonage and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between you and Vonage.
Arbitration means that all disputes and claims will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of by a judge or jury in a court.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning under the law.
It includes, but is not limited to: disputes and claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Vonage, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; disputes and claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); disputes and claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement; disputes and claims that are currently the subject of individual litigation; disputes and claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and disputes and claims concerning the scope of this arbitration provision.
References to "Vonage," "us" and "you" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the service under this agreement or any prior agreements between you and Vonage.
14.2 Informal Resolution of Disputes.
==========
Our customer care department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer's satisfaction.
If you have a dispute or claim against us, you should first contact the Vonage customer care department by telephone at 1-VONAGE-HELP (1-866-243-4357) or by email at http://www.vonage.com/contactus.php.
In the event your dispute or claim is not resolved to your satisfaction, you may seek to have that dispute or claim resolved as set forth below.
==========
14.3 Formal Notice of Disputes.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute.
(A) A Notice of Dispute to Vonage must be sent to Vonage:
(1) by certified mail addressed to: Vonage, Attn: Chief Legal Officer, 23 Main Street, Holmdel, New Jersey 07733; or
(2) by email addressed to arbitration@vonage.com
(B) A Notice of Dispute to you must be sent to you

(2) by email addressed to you at the last email address you registered with Vonage.
(C) The Notice of Dispute must
(1) describe the nature and basis of the dispute or claim; and
(2) set forth the specific relief sought.
(D) If you and Vonage do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or Vonage may commence an arbitration proceeding.
==========
You may download or copy a form to initiate an arbitration proceeding from the AAA website: http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=2062.
The amount of any settlement offer made by you or Vonage shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Vonage is entitled.
14.4 Arbitrator and Arbitral Rules.
The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
You may contact the AAA by telephone at 1-800-778-7879, by email at Websitemail@adr.org, or by mail at 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10019.
The arbitration shall be governed by the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
14.5 Location and Procedure of Arbitration.
==========
Unless you and Vonage mutually agree otherwise, all hearings conducted as part of the arbitration shall take place at a location, convenient to you, in the county or parish of your billing address.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you or Vonage may request that the arbitration be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim is in excess of $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
==========
14.6 Fees and Costs.
If you cannot afford it, Vonage will advance all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.
You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witness fees.
==========
If the arbitration proceeding is decided in Vonage's favor, you shall reimburse Vonage for the fees and costs advanced to you.
If the arbitration proceeding is decided in your favor, you will not be required to reimburse Vonage for any of the fees and costs advanced by Vonage.
If the party elects to appeal an award, the prevailing party in the appeal shall be entitled to recover all reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in that appeal.
==========
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this arbitration provision, Vonage shall pay all fees and costs which it is required by law to pay.
14.7 Waiver of Jury Trial.
You and Vonage agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Vonage are waiving the right to a trial by jury.
14.8 Waiver of Class Actions.
==========
You and Vonage agree that the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
You and Vonage agree that you and Vonage may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
You and Vonage agree that, unless you and Vonage agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's or entity's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
==========
Despite §13.7 or any other provision in this agreement to the contrary, if this specific waiver of class actions provision, or any portion thereof, is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution and binding arbitration provision shall be null and void.
14.9 Statute of Limitations:
You must contact us within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute (except for billing disputes which are subject to section 9.5 of the agreement), or you waive the right to pursue a claim based upon such event, facts, or dispute.
14.10 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement:
You and we agree:
(a) you may take your dispute to small claims court, if your dispute qualifies for hearing by such court;
(b) if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue in court claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due debt and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement;
(c) you or we may take any disputes over the validity of any party's intellectual property rights to a court of competent jurisdiction;
(d) any dispute related to or arising from allegations associated with fraudulent or unauthorized use, theft, or piracy of service may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction; and

14.11 Modification of Arbitration Provision.
