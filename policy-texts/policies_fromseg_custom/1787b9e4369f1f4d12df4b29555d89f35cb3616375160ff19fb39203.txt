MEDIACAFE ADVERTISING CLIENTS
Overview
Like most corporate websites, and nearly all advertising agencies, we   collect information about clients and prospective clients for one   principal reason: it helps us to better serve you.
It helps us improve   your experience on our websites and assures that we can communicate with   you about your account; it better equips us to develop services that   cater to your particular needs.
It’s also the best way of ensuring that   you get to take advantage of new services and product offerings   quickly.
Types of Information
Mediacafe gathers two types of information about our corporate   website’s users: Personal Information that clients provide through   optional, voluntary submissions, such as email and online registration   forms to Mediacafe, and non-personal information that we collect   automatically to observe site trends and gain a better understanding of   our clients’ experiences with our web site and advertising application.
==========
Personal Information means any information that may be used to   identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, work   or home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card   information such as the credit card number, card verification value, and   the billing address.
The types and amount of Personal Information   collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity.
This   Personal Information is critical to us in developing services that help   you achieve your business objectives, and we may use it to communicate   with you about your account or our services.
Mediacafe only collects   Personal Information that we consider necessary for providing you with   the world class service you expect as an Mediacafe client.
If you communicate with us through e-mail, regular mail, or the   phone, or choose to leave feedback on any of our websites, we may also   save that information and use it to improve our customer support and   client services, to troubleshoot other problems or resolve disputes, or   for other business purposes.
==========
If you are referred to us from another   company or website, we may receive certain additional information about   you from that entity.
In addition, we may use your Personal Information   to send you special offers or information from our trusted business   partners.
You may choose to not receive these offers by opting out when   you first receive such an offer.

We may aggregate Personal Information, and disclose such information   to third parties for a variety of reasons, including for advertising,   marketing and promotional purposes.
However, if we do this, we will   aggregate this information and not disclose information in a manner that   directly identifies you.
