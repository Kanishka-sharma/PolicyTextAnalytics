What categories of data will not be collected or processed
We do not collect nor process the following categories of data:

Data that might be regarded as sensitive under Article 9 GDPR, that is information concerning your race, sexual orientation, political affiliation or religious beliefs, among others.
Data that might be used for the purpose of online behavioural advertising, that is data concerning your Internet navigation over time, and that might be used in order to infer your personal interests.
What this data is used for
We use the categories of data mentioned above primarily in order to deliver to you targeted advertising we believe will be of particular interest to you.
For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at
https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work
In particular, we can divide all the potential processing of the data in three different categories:
(1)    Buying advertising slots and managing campaigns.
By using device identifiers and contextual data such as geolocation, visited website, and date and hour of visit, we can deliver advertisement specifically to your phone.
Managing advertising campaigns also means that we use your data for ancillary activities, such as enabling standard advertising controls, and to protect and investigate fraudulent or illegal activity.
(2)    Monitoring campaign performance.
By using our platforms’device and cookie identifiers, we can track whether users that click on or simply see the advertisement we manage actually visit the website of our clients, and whether they actually buy or subscribe to any product or service.
(3)  Retargeting and segmenting.
At the request of our clients, we might create lists of devices that we want to target in our campaigns, because they have previously carried certain activities, such as visiting our client’s website.
In doing so, we segment Internet users into different audiences that can be targeted separately.
We do not carry out automated decision-making processes, as described in Article 22 GDPR.
==========
Processing data in aggregate
In addition to all the uses detailed above, we process user data derived from our platforms as an aggregate, anonymous and non-individual level, in order to (1) operate and improve our technology, (2) conduct research and development, (3) report on campaign performance with our clients, and (4) carry out campaign forecasting.
Data processed in aggregate is not regarded as personal data, as it does not relate to any particular identified or identifiable person.
Retaining data
We may store the information we collect through our platforms, such as IP address and other information described above, for up to 90 days before we aggregate that data into summary reports.
Through our platforms, we store the aggregated summary data (which for example, does not include IP address or other information that may be tied to a particular browser or device) for longer than 90 days.
==========
Sharing data
We share the data with other companies operating in the online advertising industry, in order to carry out the campaign management, performance monitoring, and retargeting and segmenting functioned outlined above.
In particular, we may enter data processing agreements with the following categories of data recipients:

With real time bidding platforms, for the purpose of managing advertisement campaigns.
With our clients (i.e. advertising agencies and advertising networks), for the purposes of retargeting and segmenting.
With trackers, data management platforms and technology suppliers, for the purpose of performance monitoring, and in   order to carry out retargeting and segmenting.
