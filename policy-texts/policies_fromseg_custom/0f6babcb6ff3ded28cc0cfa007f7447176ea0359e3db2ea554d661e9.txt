User Options and Responsibilities
Your user profile contains information about you that you may want to share with others.
Protecting the privacy of your profile is your responsibility.
We caution you not to share sensitive information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driver's license numbers) with other users whom you do not know or place such information in your profile.
Any information you choose to display on imeem.com, including your profile, will be viewable by the entire Web (i.e., everyone).
For your own safety we caution you not to include home addresses, telephone numbers or any other personal information that could allow strangers to contact you outside of the imeem service.
To maintain privacy it is also important not to share your password with anyone.
Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password.
It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis.
Identity theft is a serious concern to all of us.
To help protect yourself against identity theft, please remember that imeem will NEVER ask for your password in either a non-secure or unsolicited email communication.
