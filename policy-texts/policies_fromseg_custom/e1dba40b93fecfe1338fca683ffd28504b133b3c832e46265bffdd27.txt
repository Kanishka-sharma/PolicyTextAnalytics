The Fresno Bee has a firm commitment to privacy.
We take your privacy concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address them.
That is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on information-gathering and disclosure.
==========
Your Personal Information
From time to time, we will ask for information that personally identifies you, as in our user surveys or registration for The Fresno Bee services such as e-mail, forums, or promotions.
We use this information to operate The Fresno Bee's services, provide you with the highest quality services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest.
We will not disclose any personal information without your advance permission except when we believe the law requires us to do so or the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of The Fresno Bee, or as explained below or in our User Agreement.
In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information but only in a form that does not identify individual users.
For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range.
Occasionally, we may disclose personal information in other circumstances, but we will only do this if we have explained at the time we collect the information the purpose for which it will be disclosed.

Kids' Privacy
The Fresno Bee is particularly concerned with providing a safe online environment for kids.
Therefore, in areas operated by The Fresno Bee that are directed to kids or when we learn that a user is under the age of 13, we will ask for parental consent before collecting additional personal information about the child or allowing the child to use the The Fresno Bee services to provide additional personal information.
Parental consent can be provided in two ways:
Send a fax copy of a completed Parental Consent Form, including your signature, to the facsimile number provided on the Parental Consent Form (which will be provided in applicable areas on our site); or
Call our toll-free number at the telephone number provided on the Parental Consent Form.
The Fresno Bee will not knowingly disclose personal information about users under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as required by law.
If for any reason you wish to access, update or remove information about your child or terminate your child's account, you may fax or call The Fresno Bee at the numbers listed above or send an e-mail to staff@fresnobee.com
The Fresno Bee strongly recommends parental supervision when a child uses the Internet, and particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail.
We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in these areas.
==========

The Fresno Bee hosts a number of online stores that sell a variety of goods and services.
These stores may collect information from you such as your name, credit card number and other contact information.
The Fresno Bee does not collect, use or disclose this information nor does it own or control the stores or have responsibility for transactions made by those merchants.
