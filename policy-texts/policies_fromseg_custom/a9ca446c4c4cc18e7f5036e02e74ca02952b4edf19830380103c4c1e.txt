==========
WHAT THIRD-PARTY SERVICES DO WE USE?
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality in our Services is provided by third parties.
These third
			parties may use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of
			these Services.
==========
These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check
			their privacy policies to understand how they use your data.
For some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as
			other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services to our
			Services.
==========
COOKIES, BEACONS AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality in our
			Services, use cookies, pixels, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.
Cookies
Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other device.
They
			enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services,
			devices, and browsing sessions.
Cookies serve many useful purposes.
==========
For example:

Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you
				sign in to a service.
Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because
				they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they’re spending
				on the pages.
Studying this information helps us to adapt the Services and provide you with a better
				experience.
Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you’ve seen so you don’t get the same ad each
				time you access a Service.
Cookies help us and third parties to provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting
				information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.
When you use a web browser to access Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject
			all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.
Each browser is different, so check the help menu of your
			browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
==========
Your device operating system may contain additional
			cookie controls.
Note that some Services are designed to work using cookies, so disabling cookies may affect
			your ability to use those Services or certain parts of them.
==========
Other Local Storage
We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared
			Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services.
These
			technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above.
==========
They’re stored on your devices and can be used to
			store certain information about your activities and preferences.
However, these technologies may make use of
			different parts of your devices from standard cookies, so you might not be able to control them using
			standard browser tools and settings.
For information about disabling or deleting information contained in
			Local Shared Objects, visit http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.
==========
Beacons
We, along with certain third parties, may use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate
			information from your device to a server.
Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and
			can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you’ve viewed particular
			content or a particular email message, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon and
			the IP address of your device.
We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including
			to analyze the use of our Services and, along with cookies, to provide content and ads that are more
			relevant to you.
==========
INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING SERVICES
		
Many of our Services may include an interest-based advertising service.
When such an interest-based
			advertising service is enabled, in addition to this Privacy Policy, an additional privacy notice will also
			apply to our collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with such service.
If you use a Samsung mobile device, please consult the Samsung Mobile Ads Privacy Notice, the most current
			version of which is available at https://www.samsung.com/ca/info/privacy/samsungmobileads.

			SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY – SMART TV SUPPLEMENT
		
Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV
			experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with
			your Smart TV with voice commands.
This supplement should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy
			Policy, which also applies to your receipt of customized Smart TV experiences and can be found at https://www.samsung.com/ca/info/privacy/
			We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV
			and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy.
This
			Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.
The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content.
For
			example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or
			satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers
			through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.
In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your
			postal code.
==========
In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to
			you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services
			that will enhance your viewing experience.
We base these recommendations and additional services on:
		

Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung
				applications on your Smart TV or other devices (About the TV viewing information please see “Viewing
				Information Services” section below);
Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;
Information about your clicks on the “Like,” “Dislike,” “Watch Now,” and other buttons on your Smart TV;
			
The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video
				content;
Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data,
				information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the
				page(s) you request.
Viewing Information Services
In order to provide you with customized Smart TV experiences, some of our features and services will rely on
			your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information.
Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs
			viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them.
==========
We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information.
Your
			Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programs watched.
==========
You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular
			feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected
			for that particular feature or service.
Interest-Based Advertisement Service
The Interest-Based Advertisement Service (the “IBA Services”) is designed to provide the ability to obtain
			and view useful, interactive, and interest-based advertisements about products and services offered by
			Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third-party platforms or
			devices, including linear commercials on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.
For more detailed information about the IBA Service, please refer to the IBA Service Privacy Notice at the
			bottom of this Supplement.
==========
PSID
Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information collected for the purposes of providing interest-based
			advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the
			Personalized Service ID or “PSID.”
You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Smart TV and, once reset, your
			Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest-based advertisements will
			be de-linked from its previous PSID.
Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and
			interest-based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.
==========
Voice Recognition
You can control your Smart TV and use many of its features with voice commands.
If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice.
==========
To provide the Voice
			Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device,
			including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice
			Recognition features.
In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can
			evaluate and improve the features.
Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request
			to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by
			speaking a wake word (e.g. “Hi, Bixby”) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV.
==========
If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu.
However, this
			would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.
For more detailed information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy
			Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.
==========
Third Parties
Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that
			provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device
			identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the
			application or service.
Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices.
You
			should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and
			services you use.
==========
Country-Specific Features
Please note that one or more of the features described in this Smart TV Supplement may not be available to
			you depending on where you live.

			ensure that you understand how they collect, use and disclose your personal information.
==========
Please also note that we provide such third parties with access to a privacy-focused advertising identifier
			associated with your Samsung Smart TV called TIFA.
TIFA is a randomized version of your device's PSID
			(explained below), and this randomization ensures that such third parties do not know that it is your
			specific device to which the advertisements are being sent.
==========
Please visit www.samsungtifa.com if you would
			like to learn more about the use of TIFA for interest-based advertisements offered by third parties.
WHAT IS THE IBA SERVICE?
With your consent, obtained upon your signing up for the IBA Service, we will endeavour to provide you with
			useful, interactive, and interest-based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and
			third
			parties (such as Samsung advertising partners).
HOW DOES THE IBA SERVICE WORK?
==========
The IBA Service provides advertisements based on your interests by collecting and analyzing information
			related
			to your use of your Samsung Smart TV, including information gathered from the Viewing Information Services
			option if you have enabled it, and combining that information with data from other sources.
WHERE ARE THE ADVERTISEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE IBA SERVICE DISPLAYED?
IBA Service advertisements are displayed on your Samsung Smart TV, across various Samsung and third-party
			platforms, and other advertising-capable devices associated with your Samsung Smart TV (collectively,
			“Associated Devices”), including websites, streaming video platforms, mobile apps, smartphones, tablets, and
			other advertising-capable devices.
WILL OTHER INDIVIDUALS SEE THESE ADVERTISEMENTS?
==========
Although we use a variety of techniques to assist us in displaying interest-based advertisements on your
			Samsung
			Smart TV and Associated Devices during your use of such devices, these advertisements may also be displayed
			to
			other individuals who use your Samsung Smart TV or Associated Devices.
This may be because they are
			participating in your use of the relevant device, such as where you and others are using your Samsung Smart
			TV,
			or because those Associated Devices are detected as being associated with your Samsung Smart TV and the IBA
			Service has concluded that you may be using such Associated Devices.
HOW DOES SAMSUNG COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE IBA SERVICE?
==========
Information is collected from your Samsung Smart TV
				If you have enabled both Viewing Information Services and the IBA Service on your Samsung Smart TV,
					the IBA Service will collect information about your TV viewing history (“Samsung Smart TV Viewing
					History”) based on general interest categories (including information about the networks, channels,
					websites visited and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing
					them) and Samsung Smart TV usage information (such as how long and often you use the apps on your
					Smart TV).
The IBA Service will also collect your Samsung Smart TV’s IP address and its PSID.
The PSID is a
					unique randomly generated number that identifies your Samsung Smart TV, and that you may reset at
					any time as we explain further in the section “Your Choices”, below.
==========
Information collected from your Samsung Smart TV is received and analyzed by Samsung Ads
				The core technology of the IBA Service is maintained by Samsung Ads (“Samsung Ads”), a business unit
					comprised of wholly owned subsidiaries of Samsung Electronics Corporation, including AdGear
					Technologies Inc. (“AdGear”), a wholly-owned Samsung affiliate.
In order to provide the IBA Service,
					Samsung Ads receives, stores and processes the information collected through your Samsung Smart TV.
==========
By analyzing the data received over time, Samsung Ads’s system learns about what interests you and
					is able to recommend advertisements that respond to those interests.
Information received from third party data sources is combined with Samsung Smart TV data
				With your consent, provided through your acceptance of this Privacy Notice and where permitted by
					law, in order to refine its understanding of your interests Samsung Ads receives, stores and
					processes generalized geolocation data based on your IP address (“Geo-IP”), as well as behavioural
					and demographic data, from third party data sources with whom you have agreed to share your
					information.
Samsung Ads combines this information with the information collected from your Samsung
					Smart TV, and uses this information to provide advertisements that may be of interest to you.
Samsung Ads also uses this data to learn whether there are Associated Devices related to your Samsung
					TV.
==========
Samsung Ads receives information from advertising service providers with whom you have agreed to
				share your information , and responds with additional information
				Through Samsung Ads, the IBA Service is connected to several service providers that manage
					advertising space made available on websites, in apps, and in streamed audio and video content.
Samsung Ads matches requests to fill advertising space that it receives from these service providers
					with its database of Samsung Smart TVs and Associated Devices, and with the interests that Samsung
					Ads has associated with such devices.
When Samsung Ads finds a suitable match, it sends the service
					provider a response containing an advertisement than can then be sent onward to the webpage, app, or
					content being displayed on the applicable device.
==========
For additional information, please see the
					sections below entitled “Information We Obtain and Use” and “Information We Disclose”.
Samsung Ads receives information from viewability and verification services, and discloses summary
				reports of that information to advertisers
				At the request of its advertising partners, Samsung Ads may work with one or more third party service
					providers to verify that the advertisement was displayed.
For each advertising campaign, Samsung Ads
					provides an anonymized statistical report summarizing such data to the applicable advertising
					partner.
==========

YOUR CHOICES
You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from the IBA Service, and from third party platforms and
			applications, on your Samsung Smart TV at any time through your Smart TV settings menu, at Menu > Support >
			Terms & Policy or Menu > Smart Hub > Terms & Policy.
The IBA Service provides ads using unique, randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifiers,
			known as “PSID” on Samsung Smart TVs and “Advertising ID” on Samsung mobile devices.
You can reset your PSID
			by selecting “Reset PSID” on the settings menu of your Samsung Smart TV.
==========
Resetting your PSID also
			automatically resets your TIFA.
If you reset the PSID on your Samsung Smart TV, any data collected and
			associated with your previous PSID or TIFA will no longer be used to deliver interest-based ads to you.
Please note that if you reset your PSID, it may take some time for our systems to update your information
			due to technical reasons.
==========
Please also note that resetting your PSID will not stop the delivery of
			interest-based ads to you.
To opt out of receiving interest-based ads on your Samsung Smart TV, please
			adjust the settings on your device, as described above.
For information about how you may exercise choice
			over the interest-based ads we may serve to you on your other Samsung mobile devices, please visit
			https://www.samsung.com/ca/info/privacy/.
==========
If you opt out of the IBA Service, the IBA Service and third party platforms and applications will no longer
			deliver interest-based ads on your Samsung Smart TV.
Please note, however, that opting out of the IBA
			Service may not prevent the delivery of generic advertisements to your Smart TV.
