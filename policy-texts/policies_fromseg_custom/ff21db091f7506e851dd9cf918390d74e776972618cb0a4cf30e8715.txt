Information We May Collect About You
Information we collect when you are served an advert from our Services (“Advertising Data”).
Sometimes when you are using particular audio services or other publishers that we work with (such as music streaming sites, internet radio, and podcast services), you may be served with personalised audio or video adverts from us through that service.
We call these publishers and providers of those audio or video services “Media Owners”.
We only ever serve you with an advert if we are requested to do so by the Media Owner.
Each request we receive will contain your IP address and information about your device.
The Media Owner will ensure that it has all necessary and appropriate consents and notices in place and will honour all opt-out of consumer choice mechanisms as directed by the consumer, before sending the data to us to process the request.
The Media Owner may also pass us other information that they hold about you, such as your first name, age, gender, login preferences, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and your preferences (e.g. the music you are listening to or preferred genre).
==========
We may also supplement this information with further information from third parties.
This could include information about your device location, the weather in that location, your interactions with the service or website, or other socio-demographic data about you.

A. Advertising Data
We use the Advertising Data we collect about you and we receive from others to personalise each audio or video advert that you will be served, making it more relevant to you.
We measure your exposure to each advert by tracking the number of times you have requested it, heard it, viewed it or clicked it for statistics reporting purposes and for improving our service over time.
Nothing we store can be traced back to you as we use a unique and meaningless identifier to refer to the tracking data.
We use aggregate trend data to improve the quality of the ads you will be served in the future and to maintain, improve and develop new services.
==========
We occasionally produce reports and analytics for our partners and customers.
These reports show aggregate data over time to show historical performance and trends and do not contain individual data.

==========
Where We Store Your Personal Data
Your data will sometimes (depending on where the server is located) be held on secure servers within the European Economic Area ("EEA") with all reasonable technological and operation measures put in place to safeguard it from unauthorised access.
Where possible any identifiable information will be encrypted or minimised.
There may be occasions however where data that we collect from or about you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA where data protection laws are not as strict as they are in the UK.
For example, it may also be processed by our staff operating outside the EEA.
Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your contract and the provision of support services.
==========
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
Where your personal data is being transferred outside the EEA, we will make sure that any transfers are not repetitive and only limited to the minimum amount of information possible.
==========
In certain circumstances we may need to seek your consent unless there is an overriding legal need to transfer the information.
In all cases where your information is transferred outside the EEA, you have a right to contact us for information on the measures we have put in place.
7.
==========
How long we keep your data for
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
The following data will be held by us for the periods set out below as is necessary to meet the purposes for which we initially collected this information:

==========
Other websites
Our Sites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.
If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
9.
==========
Data security
We take all reasonable measures to protect the information we collect and store.
All transfers to, from and within our Platform are over HTTPS, our servers are located in a secure facility and we strictly control access to the data via strong passwords and two-factor authentication.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Sites or our Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
==========
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites; any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
10.
Your rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
==========
These are set out below.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
==========
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
==========
In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Access to your information
You have a right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you, known as a data subject access request.
You also have the right to request that information we hold about you which may be incorrect, or which has been changed since you first told us, is updated or removed.
==========

Erasure of your information
You can ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where you have withdrawn consent for us to process it (as explained below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.

==========
Withdrawing your consent

==========
Restricting or objecting to us using your Information
You can ask us to suspend the way in which we are using your information in certain scenarios, or object to our processing your data where we are relying on a legitimate interest ground (or those of a third party) and you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases where you object, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Please note that if you want us to restrict or stop processing your data this may impact on our ability to provide our services.
==========
Depending on the extent of your request we may be unable to continue providing you with our service.
Any queries or concerns about the way in which your data is being used can be sent to privacy@amillionads.com
Moving your information to another organisation

If you would like us to move, copy, or transfer your information please let us know by email to privacy@amillionads.com.
We will respond to you within one month after assessing whether or not this is possible, taking into account the technical compatibility with the other organisation in question.
==========
Automated decision making and Profiling
In order to provide you with our services, it is necessary for us to conduct profiling on your data, consisting of such as combining data from multiple sources to make a more intelligent decision around which advert to serve you (for example, we may take your rough location and combine it with the weather conditions in your local area so that the ad we serve can reference the weather where you are).
We do not use your information for automated decision making or profiling that may have a legal or similarly significant effect on you.
