Where we store your personal data
We are a global business that provides its products and services all around the world.
In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe.
The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live.
In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (the EEA), where the level of protection provided by the laws of these countries may be different than the high standard enshrined in the GDPR.
==========
Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all personal data we process.
At the same time, when we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission, which legally bind the receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected in accordance with this privacy policy.
By using the service, you acknowledge this transfer, storing or processing.
When you enter payment information (such as credit card numbers) on our order forms, the transmission of that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
==========
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
4.
==========
Disclosure of your information
We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties.
As described in the introduction to this Privacy Policy, Privax is part of the Avast Group, and we may disclose your data subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy to any member of the Avast Group for the purposes of the performance of the contract, the provision of the service, service research, statistics, internal analytics, aggregated reporting, product development, cross-product in-product messaging, and direct marketing.
The Avast Group has a new unified Privacy Policy and to the extent its Privacy Policy differs, we will ensure that any personal data collected pursuant to the VPN Privacy Policy and shared with another member of the Avast Group is treated according to terms at least as strict as this Privacy Policy.
Please note that the Avast Group is comprised of companies and offices around the world.
In order to do business around the globe, we may share your personal data across our offices and companies which may be in countries with different laws regarding the collection and use of personal data than the country we collected it from.
Lastly, we may share your personal data:
· when necessary to deliver the product or service you require such as with a payment card provider who we use to process your credit card transaction;
· when authorized by law or necessary to comply with a valid legal process;
· when required to protect and defend the rights or property of the Avast Group, including the security of our products and services;
· when necessary to protect the personal safety, property or other rights of the public, the Avast Group or its customers or employees; or
· in connection with a sale of all or part of our business.
==========
If we receive a report from any person or organization (including law enforcement) that leads us to suspect that your account has been used in connection with any wrong-doing, we may at our discretion suspend your account, but we will not disclose any personal information that may identify you unless we are legally compelled to do so.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will abide by this Privacy Policy with respect to any data collected by Privax, and any affected users will be informed if we transfer any personal data to a third party or if personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy as a result.

Your Rights with Respect to your Data; Opt-out
Under the GDPR and applicable UK law, you, as a data subject, have certain rights.
Rights such as the right to access information held about you.
Your right of access can be exercised.
You have the right to ask us about the personal data we process about you, the purpose and nature of the processing, and to provide information on who we share it with.
You have the right to request that we update, correct, delete (assuming that this does not impact the services we are providing to you) or export (port) your data, as well as the right to object to processing and lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.
You exercise these rights on the Privacy Preference portal or by emailing us at info@hidemyass.com.
Please note that we may reject or refuse to fulfill to the fullest extent requests which risk the privacy of others or are unreasonable or repetitive, or would require disproportionate effort.
==========
Please note that we may generally keep your personal data for one year after you stop being a customer (but we typically keep your personal data no longer than is reasonably necessary given the purposes for which the data was collected).
Some of the data may be retained longer, for instance, if we have a legal obligation to retain it (e.g., for the purposes of tax), or, as the case may be, until the applicable statute of limitations expires.
You have the right to opt-out of receiving certain emails (e.g., marketing communications) at any time by following the relevant unsubscribe process outlined in the applicable email.
==========
Please be aware that our emails may include important or useful information about our services.
We may also contact you via email in the context of our contract (transaction) to give you information about the transaction or the term of your license.
Given the transactional nature of these emails, these are necessary in order for us to manage our relationship with you and may not be able to unsubscribe from these transactional emails.

Links to 3rd Party Sites; new unified Avast Privacy Policy
Periodically, our Site or products may contain links to and from websites or other external destinations managed by third parties.
If you follow a link to any of these destinations (like offers on mobile app stores etc.), please note that those sites have their own privacy policy.
When you are on those sites you are subject to those policies, and should therefore read and understand them before you submit any personal data to those sites.
The Avast Group has a Privacy Policy that governs information collected using the websites or applications of all its companies.
Please read and accept the Avast privacy policy before deciding to use these sites and products.
