You have control over who can view your profile
By default access to your profile is made public.

It does not include any other personal information such as your email or home address.
You may choose to limit access to your profile to only your friends.
You can also make your support of any organization or fundraising campaign completely anonymous.

Nobody will ever see how much money you donate
The amount of money each of us decides to give to charity is a private, personal choice.
==========
Some of us have only a few dollars to spare, while others are fortunate enough to have the means to give much more.
Because of this, we never display how much money you or any of your friends have donated.
We do give recognition to people who help raise a significant amount of money by starting Fundraising Pages; however, we only note the total amount of money raised among all participants and will never reveal the contribution size made by any one member.
==========
Your personal information will never be given to anyone without your knowledge
Your personal information is just that - yours.
We will never give your personal information to any nonprofit without your explicit consent.
If you would like to receive direct communication from the nonprofits you support, you may choose to have us pass them your name, email and/or home address after making a donation.
You can also opt in to sharing your email address with nonprofits while participating in actions, or directly sign up to receive their e-newsletter.
==========
Change.org will never sell or trade our contact lists.
However, keep in mind that it is fairly common practice for nonprofits to rent or trade the names and addresses of their donors with other organizations.
We cannot control this practice, so if you do not want to receive mail from nonprofits you have not contributed to, first check whether the nonprofits you support have a policy against trading donor information before requesting that we pass them your home or email address.
==========
Only receive Email messages you want
We know that you are busy and receiving email notifications from a social site can be distracting.
We also know that some people like to receive up-to-the-minute updates on the activities they are interested in.
For that reason we allow our users full control over the type of email notifications they receive.
To edit your email settings, click on the "Account Settings" button on the right of your profile page and select the "Email Notifications" link on the subsequent page.
Also, any update email that we send will include an unsubscribe link that you can immediately click on to opt out of future mailings.
