The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control

NBA.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control.
The servers for NBA.com are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility.
Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks, and restricting access to information on our servers.
When receiving financial information (e.g., credit card number, credit card expiration date) for completing online transactions, our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol.
In addition, only those trained employees needed to carry out our business functions will be authorized to have access to information on individual NBA.com customers.
It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties.
==========
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
While we strive to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
In addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials and if asked to disclose it by subpoena, court order or other legal process.

NBA.COM NOTE TO PARENTS


It is NBA.com's policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from children.
A number of interactive features on NBA.com require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, site  registration).
All registrants will be required to enter their full name, date of birth, complete address and e-mail address.
In some cases, users will be required to select a special member name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password.
==========
If NBA.com determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on NBA.com, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information.
Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on NBA.com that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be contacted about special offers or promotions.
NBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on NBA.com.
Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies and are themselves responsible for ensuring that their sites comply with applicable laws.
Features that permit registration by children under 13 years old include fantasy games (e.g., Virtual GM) hosted by ESPN.com and team screensavers hosted by NewTier.com and Websaverlive.com.
==========
Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the web sites on which registration occurs.
For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.
However, NBA.com does not knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 years old.
If you have any questions or comments, you can contact us at FanRelations@NBA.com.
