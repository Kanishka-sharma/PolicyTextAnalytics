Macromedia and your privacy
At Macromedia, we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to macromedia.com, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences.
For this reason, we want to present information on macromedia.com that is tailored to your own information preferences.
Also for this reason, we may ask you, on occasion, to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of macromedia.com, download free software, request new information, or subscribe to a customized newsletter.
We will use the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on macromedia.com (and related Macromedia sites) are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.
==========
If, for example, you provide Macromedia with your name or alias, mailing address, or telephone number, Macromedia and its partners may use your postal address and phone number to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, and new services ("partners" may include value-added resellers and authorized training partners).
If you provide your e-mail address (as an alternative to, or in addition to, your mailing address and phone number), Macromedia may contact you via e-mail.
Unlike postal addresses and phone numbers, Macromedia never releases e-mail addresses to its partners.
If you do not want Macromedia, our partners, or selected third parties to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting Macromedia directly.
As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to "opt [back] in" and have Macromedia contact you based on your previous or new preferences.
For detailed instructions, please see the "Contact us…" section in this statement, below.
==========
If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most of Macromedia's Web sites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.
Macromedia membership and the usage of automatically logged information
Macromedia offers free membership to all macromedia.com visitors.
In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide both personal information and preferences.
This information is stored and protected by your user-established Member ID and Password.
==========
There is an additional "Remember Me" option that allows you to be recognized (by your user-designated name or alias) when returning to any Macromedia Web site in the future.
Acceptance of this option allows Macromedia to place a log file (cookie) that contains only enough information to identify you upon return visits, thereby eliminating the need to continually ask you for the same generic information.
This cookie contains no personal information, with the exception of your name or alias that you previously provided.
No information, other than that found in the log file, will be accessed by any Macromedia system.
Access to all user-provided information always requires both your established Member ID and Password.
How Macromedia will protect your personal information
Macromedia will always protect the personal information that you share with us.
Macromedia stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment.
==========
If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit card number only to secure your current payment.
The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand and will not use the number for marketing purposes.
If Macromedia requests general demographic information (such as your county, district, education, etc.), information shared with third parties is absolutely limited to reporting purposes only.
No phone numbers, e-mail or postal addresses are shared with any entities for demographic reports.
Macromedia may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company.
To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information.
If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.
==========
