21.
==========
Binding Individual Arbitration
You and Square agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.
ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).
All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org), where such arbitration is conducted in the United States, or JAMS (https://www.jamsadr.com) or the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Canada (https://www.icdr.org), where such arbitration is conducted in Canada.
The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies to any arbitration that takes place within the United States.
==========
Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.
If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use under a consumer protection law of a province or territory, any arbitration hearing will occur within such jurisdiction and be governed by the laws of such jurisdiction.
Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in: (a) San Francisco, California, for Disputes involving Square, Inc.; (b) Toronto, Ontario, for Disputes involving Square Canada and/or Square Technologies; (c) another mutually agreeable location; or (d) a location ordered by the arbitrator.
==========
The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
We will pay the arbitration fees due to the arbitrator for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section.
If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to legal fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator.
For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our legal fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.
==========
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Square also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.
Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above: (i) you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) involving Square, Inc. will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California; and (ii) you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) involving Square Canada and/or Square Technologies will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the provincial or federal courts in the City of Toronto, Ontario.
22.
==========
Governing Law
With respect to Square, Inc., these General Terms, any Additional Terms and any related Dispute will be governed by California law and/or applicable United States federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California, without regard to choice of law or conflicts of law principles.
With respect to Square Canada and/or Square Technologies, these General Terms, any Additional Terms and any related Dispute will be governed by Ontario law and/or applicable Canadian federal law, without regard to choice of law or conflicts of law principles.
23.
Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute
Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues or you shall be deemed to have waived any such right.
24.
Assignment
These General Terms, any Additional Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder or thereunder may not be transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.
25.

Third Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites
You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by Square (“Third Party Services”).
If you decide to use Third Party Services you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these services.
We are not responsible for the performance of any Third Party Services.
The Services may contain links to third party websites.
The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by Square.
Such third party websites are not governed by these General Terms.
You access any such website at your own risk.
We expressly disclaim any liability for these websites.
==========
When you use a link to go from the Services to a third party website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.

26.
==========
Other Provisions
These General Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Square regarding the Services.
In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any other Square agreement or Policy, these General Terms will prevail and control the subject matter of such conflict.
If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
==========
These General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws.
No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.
