GoDaddy's privacy partner, Domains by Proxy®, protects you from hackers, hijackers, and data miners by replacing your name, address and other details in the public WHOIS directory with its business address and phone number.
You retain complete control of the domain, including the rights to sell, renew, cancel or transfer it.
==========
Hijackers beware.
Thieves who hijack websites hosted on your domain tend to use them to carry out scams, deliver spam and spread malware.
==========
Both Privacy and Privacy & Business Protection safely hide the personal information hackers need to take control of your domain.
Frequently asked questions
What's in the WHOIS directory?
The WHOIS directory is a searchable list of every single domain name registered in the world, including the names, addresses and other details of the people who own them.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires accredited registrars to publish this information in the WHOIS listing as soon as the domain is registered.
So everyone can see my information?
The short answer is yes.
The name, address and phone number you submit when you register your domain is publicly accessible by anyone at any time.
==========
This may be good news if you have a domain name you'd like to sell.
Or it may be bad news if your name and contact info is collected by a spammer, hacker or cyber-criminal.
What about my business?
==========
I want people to find me.
Privacy and Business Protection includes a "virtual business card" designed to drive traffic to your website and increase the reach of your existing efforts without sacrificing your privacy.
How does Privacy Protection work?
==========
Instead of displaying your personal information in the WHOIS database for all to see, our partner Domains By Proxy will replace it with its own.
The domain will belong to you - except now, you and Domains By Proxy® will be the only ones who know it.
What are the benefits of Privacy Protection?
Privacy Protection through Domains By Proxy gives you full control over your domain names while protecting you from identity theft, domain-related spam and domain name hijacking.
Domains By Proxy even creates a private and unique email address for each domain name.
You get to decide if you want the email forwarded to you, filtered, or completely blocked.
==========
What is Privacy & Business Protection?
Privacy & Business Protection includes all the features of Privacy Protection, plus Domain Ownership Protection, TrustedSite Seal and Business Registration.
It protects your personal details and your business domain whilst also providing business visibility and customer reassurance.
==========
You will also receive email updates and an annual domain name status report help you keep track of vital domain name information.
NOTE: Before you purchase Privacy & Business Protection, make sure the Registrant contact for your domain name includes a valid email address.
You must have access to the registrant email address to make future changes to your domain name or Privacy & Business Protection service.
