As parents and family members you have a vested interest in how your student is performing academically, if your student has gotten into any "trouble" on campus, or what their class schedule might be to see their academic progress.
Unfortunately those details cannot always be provided to those other then the student themselves due to the rights of a student under the Family Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment.
While there are exceptions to keeping this information private, the student, recognized as a matriculated student at UC San Diego is protected from their private information being shared publicly.
What this means for you as a parent or family member is that your student's protected information will not be as readily available as maybe it was in high school.
==========
The information below details what information is kept private, what constitutes public information, and essentially, what FERPA is in the higher education environment.
For more information, see the Department of Education web site, UCSD PPM 160-2(the policy that details how FERPA actualizes in the UCSD community), or email parents@ucsd.edu.
Students are sent the following notification annually detailing their rights under UCSD PPM 160-2 and FERPA.
