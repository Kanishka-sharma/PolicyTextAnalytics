PRECISO SERVICE PRIVACY POLICY
PRECISO Service Privacy Policy is designed to describe how we approach user privacy as an Internet user interacting with websites that have implemented the PRECISO advertising technology.
1.
==========
GENERAL INFORMATION
PRECISO SRL is advertising technology company that provides online advertisement services to advertisers (such as e-commerce stores or online stores) in the programmatic advertising environment.
Our role is to give advertisers a precise platform to show display ads of their products on various publishers’ websites which is both in desktop and mobile environments.
==========
The ads we show are personalized according to the information on user previous online activity.
We will display to the ads of those advertisers whose websites or apps they had visited in the past or ads that we believe otherwise match their current shopping interests.
In order to serve personalized ads, we process certain information related to their online activity that helps us understand what users current shopping interests might be and allows us to display an ad and analyze how it performs.
==========
While doing so, we aim at ensuring the highest level of privacy protection and transparency.
We comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
2.
HOW DO WE COLLECT DATA
In order to collect data, we use cookies, which are text files inserted in the web browser when users visit advertisers’ or publishers’ websites or apps, as well as other tracking technologies available on their device, such as mobile advertising ID.
3.
==========
WHAT DATA WE PROCESS
We process the following groups of data:
(a)       Information related to user browsing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps — it helps us understand what sorts of products and services they are interested in and, consequently, determine which ads should be displayed to them match their current shopping interests.
We process this data on behalf of the advertisers for whom we conduct advertising campaigns (as a data processor), specifically for the purpose of creating their user profile.
(b)      Information that users are currently entering a publisher’s website or app, where we may display an ad to you — it comes within a so called bid request, which is an offer to buy an advertising space on the publisher’s website or app in order to display an ad (for details, see Section 4 below).
We process this information as a data controller for the purposes of displaying ads, ad measurement, brand safety, product development, and fraud detection.
==========
(c)       Information regarding the delivery of our ads, i.e., impressions of an ad (e.g., whether we displayed an ad to users and, if so, which ad we selected) and their interactions with an ad (e.g., whether they clicked on it).
We process this information as a data controller for the purposes of displaying ads (in particular for frequency capping and ad rotation), ad measurement, and product development.
Users  may find a full list of categories of data we process as a data controller in our GDPR privacy notice (see Section 5 below).
==========
While providing our services, we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, or financial data, such as credit card details.
We do not receive any additional data from advertisers or partners, which, along with the data collected by our technology, would enable us to directly identify users.
4.
==========
HOW WE USE DATA
While users are visiting an advertiser’s website or app, we collect certain information related to their activity there, such as which items they viewed, put in the basket, and bought.
Those browsing patterns on the advertiser’s website or app help us understand what sorts of products and services they are currently interested in and thus display to them, on publishers’ digital properties (e.g., news portals), only ads compatible with these interests.
==========
We display our personalized ads with the use of a programmatic auction system known as real-time bidding.
Real-time bidding procedure happens at the moment users enter a publisher’s website or app that offers an advertising space for sale.
While such website is loading, a bid request is sent to us by the publisher or our business partner cooperating with the publisher (supply-side platform) inviting us to buy a certain ad space.
==========
After receiving such bid request, our technology uses information about your previous browsing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps to decide whether to buy the auctioned ad space and, if so, which ad to display.
For instance, if users had recently visited our client’s website looking for a pair of pants, we may display to them an ad of those same pants they had viewed there and similar pair of pants or complementary products, such as belt or shirt offered by that same advertiser.
We may also use information on the content of the website where the ad is to be displayed for the additional personalization of this particular ad.
However, we never use such website content to personalize future ads, in particular we do not assign this information to their user profile in order to categorize them such as  grouping them to a particular segment) or try to determine their shopping interests on the basis of their browsing history on publishers’ websites or apps.
Moreover, we do not use their browsing data across advertisers, which means that a browsing activity from one advertiser’s website or app does not affect other advertisers’ ads we display.
For instance, the fact that they looked for a pair of pants in our 123 Client website, it will not result in us displaying them a pair of pants  from our XYZ Client website except when they had previously browsed similar products on that a XYZ Client website too.
==========
After we display an ad to users, we collect information regarding ad impressions, that we actually displayed an ad to the users, which ad was selected, and when and on what type of device it was displayed) and users  interactions with the ad (mainly whether they clicked on it or not).
We use this information for the analysis of how our ads perform, for the creation of statistical reports for advertisers regarding the delivery of their ads, and subsequently for attribution and billing purposes.
We also process this data for the control of the frequency of ads we display to users under frequency capping and for campaign improvement purposes.
==========
Preciso bidder is integrated with the real time bidding environment through matching of our technical identifiers, e.g., cookie IDs or mobile advertising IDs (“cookie matching”) with those used by our technology partners.
It enables us to (a) receive a bid request and eventually serve an ad on a publisher’s website or app that uses our business partners’ digital advertising technology and (b) collect information related to our ad serving activities.
Upon an advertiser’s specific request and on the basis of the information provided by such advertiser, we may perform cross-device tracking that consists of displaying the same categories of ads of this particular advertiser’s products or services on different devices you use (e.g. laptops and smartphones).
We do not, however, perform specific data analyses in order to link the devices that users use on the basis of the patterns of their online behavior.
Preciso does not do probabilistic cross-device tracking.
==========
We also utilize user personal data for the detection of frauds and other potential dangers to privacy security, for the calculation of the usage levels of our technology, and for brand safety purposes, i.e., to analyze whether publishers’ websites are a suitable environment for our ads to be displayed and to develop and improve our products.
We do not purchase any third-party data from data providers for service optimization purposes or sell data we process to any third parties.
Advertisers and publishers whose websites or apps that users visit may independently collect and use their data for different purposes.
Please consult their privacy policies for more information in this regard.

According to the GDPR, such information may be considered personal data (this type of non-personally identifiable data is referred to as “pseudonymous data”).
