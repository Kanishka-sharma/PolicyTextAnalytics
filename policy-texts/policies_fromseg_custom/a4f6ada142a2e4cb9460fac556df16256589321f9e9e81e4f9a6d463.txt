About this site
Cookies are the tools that give websites a sense of memory, allowing them to recognize one user from another.
Most sites use them to do anything from counting the number of viewers they have to delivering tailored editorial content.
Online they help us shop, use chat services and take part in communities.
The advertising that funds many free sites relies on the reporting information delivered by counting cookies and website editors can use cookies to understand which of their pages are most popular.
