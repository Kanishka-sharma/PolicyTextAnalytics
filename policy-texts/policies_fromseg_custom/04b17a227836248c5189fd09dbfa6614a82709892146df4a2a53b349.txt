Privacy Policy
Purpose and Scope
This policy discloses what information we gather about you when 
you visit MySQL.com or buy product directly from us.
It describes 
how we use that information and how you can control it.
Information MySQL AB gathers and tracks
MySQL AB collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data 
that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product 
information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying 
directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect 
when users interact with us.
Personal information
We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send 
information you've requested and to fulfill orders.
The specific 
use of your personal information varies, depending on how you 
contact us:

When you subscribe to MySQL mailing lists to receive MySQL news
and product information, you must provide email address.
We never 
sell or rent your email address you provide when subscribing to 
our lists.
Please note, that MySQL mailing lists are archived by
several third party sites and your email address can be found from
their archives and MySQL AB doesn't have control over those archives.
When you order MySQL commercial licenses, or purchase commercial
support, or buy training, we add you to our mailing lists and will
contact you in MySQL related issues now and then.
When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name, 
address, and email address so we can administer the contest and 
notify winners.
We release personal information when we believe that release is 
appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, 
property, or safety of MySQL AB, our users, or others.
