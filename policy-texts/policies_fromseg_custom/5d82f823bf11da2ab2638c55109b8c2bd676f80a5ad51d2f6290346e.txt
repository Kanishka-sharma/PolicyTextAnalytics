VICE VOICES
As part of our platform we are running ‘VICE Voices’, a community through which VICE fans can participate in conversations and cultural surveys for VICE Media, as well as enter monthly prize draws for rewards such as VICE-branded items, which will be subject to terms and conditions accessible here.
VICE Voices is regulated by VICE media (a global digital media company) and Vision Critical (a leading community and customer intelligence company).
==========
VICE Voices will involve the collecting and processing of personal data, some of which is considered more sensitive (e.g. sexual orientation and ethnicity), for research purposes.
When signing up to VICE Voices, you (or if you are under 13, your parents) will have a clear opportunity to either consent to providing this data, or to refuse to do so.
==========
Consent can also be withdrawn at any time, and all personal information will be purged from the community within 30 days.
Do we use Cookies to collect personal data on you?
To provide better service to you on our websites, we use cookies to collect your personal data when you browse.
See our cookie policy here for more details.
==========
Do we transfer your data outside the EEA?
In some cases the personal data we collect from you might be processed outside the United Kingdom (“UK”) or European Economic Area (“EEA”).
The countries in which your personal data is processed in may not have the same protections for your personal data that the UK or EEA do.
However we are obliged to ensure that the personal data that is processed by us and our suppliers outside of the UK or EEA is protected in the same ways as it would be if it was processed within the UK or EEA.
==========
There are therefore certain safeguards in place when your data is processed outside of the UK or EEA.
For example, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
==========
We may also use specific approved contracts with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA.
These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA .
Where we use service providers in the United States, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield scheme, which requires them to provide a similar level of protection of your personal data to what is required in the EEA.
To find out more about how we safeguard your information as related to transfers contact us on EUPrivacy@vice.com
Note that the UK is still considered to be inside the EEA during its Brexit transition period, due to end 31 December 2020.
