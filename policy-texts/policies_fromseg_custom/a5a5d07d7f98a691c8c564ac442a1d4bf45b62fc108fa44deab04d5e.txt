Personally identifiable information is collected by Kalmbach when you decide to place an order (personally or as gifts for others), register on our websites or for our newsletters, enter a contest, participate in a survey, or make a general inquiry.
The information collected when you order from us or enter a contest includes some or all of the following: name, address, phone / fax number, email address and credit card information.
==========
With regard to credit card information, we employ the Internet's strongest encryption tools and technology, allowing your transaction to be instantaneous, while as secure as possible from unauthorized access or misuse.
Surveys and Sweepstakes
With regard to surveys in which you elect to participate, we may request demographic information (age, family income level, etc.) along with basic information regarding your reading and/or hobby interests and how Kalmbach may better serve those needs.
Finally, name, address and other contact information may be collected so that we can respond to any customer service issue, request for information or other general inquiry, along with information about the nature of your inquiry.
Demographic and other information volunteered in connection with surveys is used primarily for internal purposes to improve the company's responsiveness to customers' wants, needs, interests, opinions and suggestions.
On occasion, the aggregate findings and results of such surveys may be published as a matter of interest to the hobbyists/respondents who provided the information, and/or for the benefit of trade associations or others who may occasionally sponsor such surveys.

Cookies
To enhance your online experience, we use “cookies.”
Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences.
Once you choose to furnish the site with personally indentifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie, and to personalize your experience on our Web pages.
Reporting
We use cookies to understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings, and advertisements.
Kalmbach Publishing Co. will use cookies, pixel trackers, server logs and other Internet technologies to measure the effectiveness of our website content.
We also may use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses.
We are not responsible for and do not control cookies placed in third party ads or any actions or policies of any third party advertising technology service providers or of any third party members of any related advertising networks.
==========
Uses of Information
The fundamental use of the information we collect is to respond and fulfill your needs as a customer or prospective customer.
The information is necessary and is used by us to send you the magazines, books or other products you have ordered, to process your payment, to fulfill your request to enter a contest, to recognize you as a repeat visitor to our websites, to acknowledge your interest in participating in a survey, or to resolve the customer service matter or other inquiry you have brought to our attention.
Information volunteered by you in any message or postings on Kalmbach-provided forums, discussion/bulletin boards, club membership sites, event calendars, etc., becomes public information.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in any such posted message.
==========
If you subscribe to one or more of our magazines, you will also receive a notice or notices about renewing your subscription prior to its expiration date.
You may request to be excluded from such renewal mailings (see below).
You may also receive periodic mailings from us about new products, services or upcoming events, and -- from time-to-time -- your address information may be made available to other reputable companies or organizations for marketing or information gathering purposes.
==========
Typically, such third parties serve the hobby and/or leisure-time industries in one form or another.
You may again request to be excluded from such mailings by contacting us directly or by taking other proactive measures, as specified below.
Maintaining Your Personal Privacy
At the time you volunteer personally identifiable information and at anytime thereafter, you can direct us not to use this information for promotional or informational mailings.
At your option, you may also elect to suppress the mailing of renewal notices for any of our magazines.
If you do so, your personally identifiable information will be flagged in our system as "do not promote" to correspond with your request, and you will be excluded from the related Kalmbach mailings.
You can also elect separately to be excluded from mailings by any third party to whom your address might otherwise be provided.
==========
You can, at any time, send such directions to our Customer Service Department at Kalmbach Publishing Co., P.O. Box 1612, Waukesha WI 53187-1612, or simply contact us at customerservice@kalmbach.com or webmaster@kalmbach.com.
Customer Service can also be reached by calling toll-free, 800-533-6644, 8:30am - 4:30pm Central Time, Monday - Friday.
Outside the US and Canada, call 262-796-8776.
==========
The fax number is 262-796-1615.
There are also national clearinghouse organizations and governmental entities where you can register to suppress unwanted solicitations.
The most prominent of these is the Direct Marketing Association (DMA).
The DMA provides mail, e-mail and telephone database "preference services" free of charge to consumers who wish to block all unsolicited direct mail, e-mail and telemarketing contacts, respectively.
For more information, visit DMA's website at www.the-dma.org, or contact them at (202) 955-5030.
==========
In addition to the special measures you may take to suppress unwanted solicitations by contacting us directly, Kalmbach has implemented procedures whereby files that otherwise would be used for promotional mailings are processed with the DMA to remove any records belonging to individuals who may have registered with DMA's Mail Preference Service (but not with Kalmbach).
As yet a further safeguard, many third parties to whom Kalmbach may provide personally identifiable information take the additional step to suppress the solicitation of anyone who has just recently registered with the appropriate DMA preference services, by doing so just prior to their mailing dates.
Although Kalmbach Publishing Co. uses reasonable good faith efforts to require third parties to regularly follow this practice, we cannot, of course, guarantee that they adhere to our expectations.
==========
Children
We do not intend to collect personal information from children.
Children should seek the approval of their parents before providing any personal information on our websites.
