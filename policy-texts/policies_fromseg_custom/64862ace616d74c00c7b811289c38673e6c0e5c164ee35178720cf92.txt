FedEx Corporation acknowledges the importance of protecting the privacy of FedEx.com users.
The information we collect is used to improve the services we offer, to improve our Web site’s content, and, with your permission, to contact you with updates to our web site or other marketing information.

Please see terms and conditions of the applicable FedEx Service Guide for limitations of liability and disclaimers of warranty applicable to FedEx services and various information used in FedEx services.
==========
What information is captured from visitors to FedEx.com?
The FedEx.com Web server uses an extended log file format which captures: date and time of visit, refer address (location from which a visitor comes to FedEx.com), type of Internet browser, and visitor’s IP address.
==========
(Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP Address, for identification purposes).
The log file does not capture a visitor's email address.
==========
Is personal information requested?
There are currently five areas of FedEx.com which ask for personal information.
They are: Account Registration, FedEx interNetShip Registration, FedEx eCommerce Builder, FedEx® Ship Manager Software Download and FedEx Returns Manager Registration.
==========
This list may be expanded without notice.
Even in those areas, only your name, address, email address, billing information, and business profile are requested.
==========
This information is collected to help us further develop our services, to provide you access to valuable FedEx Internet-based information and services, and to bill you for those services if you elect to use them.
How is the information used?
The information helps us identify the type of Web site content our customers value most.
We then use this information to improve the Web site.
We also use this information to send you email notifications about updates to the Web site when you give us permission, and to contact you for marketing purposes (again, only if you give us permission).
==========
None of the information collected is shared with organizations external to FedEx and its affiliate companies for commercial purposes.
Will my information be used for any other purposes?
==========
FedEx may periodically send you information about various products and services if you grant FedEx your permission to do so in your account preferences section.
Your preferences can be changed at any time.
==========
What happens when I leave FedEx.com to visit a FedEx linked Web site?
Parts of FedEx.com, such as the International Resource Center, consist of products and services hosted by business partners and other third parties.
When you leave FedEx.com to visit one of their sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from FedEx.com (the refer address).
==========
This practice allows the third party to monitor its own Web site traffic, but does not provide them with any information about you.
FedEx is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of our third party sites.
You should consult the privacy policies at those sites to determine how your information may be used.
==========
Are cookies used?
Cookies are used to achieve two goals.
==========
The first is to provide FedEx with the capability to customize information for certain segments of its customer base.
Secondly, in some instances, cookies are used to allow FedEx the opportunity to associate individual customers with their information profiles.
As an example, through the use of cookies, the FedEx interNetShip "Easy Login" feature can automatically fill in key information, and in the process save you time.
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a series of data characters that, when programmed into a Web site, is placed by the Web Server into the browser's application folder on your computer.
==========
Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the Web site to "recognize" you as a unique individual.
Please note that in most instances a cookie does not enable a User to be recognized as a name (e.g., John Doe).
Rather, it will recognize an individual as a series of numbers (e.g., TRACKID=MC_53011).
==========
