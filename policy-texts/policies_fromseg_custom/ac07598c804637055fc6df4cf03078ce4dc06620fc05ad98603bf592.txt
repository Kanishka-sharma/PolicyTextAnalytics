via consent management.
==========
Users: You are a user when you visit a page of a website or application of one of our partners (“Partner Sites”).
If you click on the hyperlink to AudienceRun, you will see a detailed notice which allows you to navigate to AudienceRun's interest portal and this privacy policy where you can opt out of personalized recommendations.
In some cases, a partner may have the AudienceRun service white label for its own offer.
In such a case, these partners must disclose their use of AudienceRun in their privacy policies.
==========
Collection and use of information: We use UUIDs, IP Address and other Usage Information so that we can serve interesting recommendations.
AudienceRun's recommendations may be paid for by an advertiser linking you to a new website or they may be organic such that the link is to another page on the same Partner's Site.
UUID.
When you, as a User, first visit a Partner Site, AudienceRun drops a cookie on your device to generate a UUID.
Alternatively, if you first interact with a Partner using that Partner's application, AudienceRun receives your advertiser ID which is assigned to you by your device.
We catalog and analyze the content you consume across Partner Sites.
==========
Our recommendations are based on: (i) a UUIDs browsing history; (ii) similar browsing patterns of other Users; (iii) recommendations that are generally popular with AudienceRun's audience at this time; (iv) some randomness.
When you interact with AudienceRun we do not collect traditional personal data from you, like your email address or name, therefore we cannot associate your name with your UUID.
The UUID is a sequence of numbers and / or letters.
==========
This UUID attaches itself to your device and varies depending on your browser combination.
In other words, AudienceRun records a different UUID depending on which device and / or which browser you use when accessing the Partner Sites.
AudienceRun will combine and consolidate a UUID from a mobile device (handheld or tablet) from a browser that then accesses an application (or vice versa) from that same device.
AudienceRun does not conduct cross device tracking and therefore cannot link a user interacting with AudienceRun on their phone as the same user who is interacting with AudienceRun on their desktop.
IP Address  In addition to your UUID, we recognise your IP address, which we translate into geolocation and delete the last octet in order to mask the identifying information.
==========
We then use this masked information, in conjunction with information we received from other trusted third party partners to determine a broad understanding of where you are located.
AudienceRun will still recognise your IP address even if you opt out of personalised tracking as this is necessary to continue serving you context-based recommendations however, in such instances your IP address is not associated with your UUID and would not form part of any user profile.
Other Usage Information  In addition to your UUID and IP address, we also collect the following information from you on (a) desktop and mobile web: (i) User Agent data: device type (e.g., iPhone), browser type, operating system ; (ii) the pages visited; (iii) the time of visit; and (iv) referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests.
The above statistical information provides us with information about how many Users visited a specific page on our Partner Sites, how long each User stayed on that page, the type of content on that page they clicked on and how they generally engaged with that page.
This information is considered personal data if Outbrain associates it with a UUID.
As AudienceRun does not have a direct relationship with Users interacting with Partner Sites, AudienceRun relies on its partners to determine the lawful basis upon which AudienceRun can process personal data.
