How we use your Personal Data and who we disclose it to 
In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better.

We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information that make the data personally identifiable to you in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation.
New Relic reserves the right to use Anonymous Data for other purposes and to disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its discretion.
If you provide feedback on any of our Services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Application Data or your Personal Data.

Information for Individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) 
4 (i) The legal basis for processing your Personal Data 
When we use your Personal Data, we take care to ensure that it is used in an appropriate way.
Use of Personal Data under European data protection law must be based on one of a number of legal grounds as set out below:
Consent: where we are processing your Personal Data on the basis of consent (that means that you have consented to our use of your Personal Data)  you may withdraw your consent to the use of your Personal Data at any time by contacting us.
Contract performance: where we are required to collect and handle your Personal Data in order to provide you with the services that we have contractually agreed to provide to you, e.g. where you have signed up to use one of our Services.
Legal obligation: where we need to use your Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations.
Legitimate interests: where we have a legitimate interest in using your information e.g. to manage our business or to allow us to improve and provide our services.
We will only rely on this legal ground if we consider that our interest in using your Personal Data for the relevant purpose is not outweighed by any interests that you may have, or any prejudice that you may suffer, from the relevant use of your Personal Data.

4 (iii) Profiling or “analytics” 
In connection with our marketing activities, we analyze some of the information that we collect about our customers to determine what offers are most likely to be of interest to different categories of customers in different circumstances and at different times.
We call this the creation of “segments”.
==========
To do this, we combine Personal Data that we have collected from customers directly together with Personal Data that we have collected from our affiliates and other partners.
From time to time, we will assess the Personal Data that we hold about you in order to assign you to a particular segment.
We may use the segment that you have been assigned to in order to tailor our marketing communications to include offers and content that are relevant to you.
We may also use this method to avoid sending you offers that are inappropriate or unlikely to be of interest to you.
For example, if you are based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and where you have given us permission to do so, we can use your information to communicate with you about Services that we consider are relevant to you.
==========
You can let us know at any time and free of charge, if you would like us to stop using your Personal Data in this way by emailing us, calling in or writing to us
4 (iv) How long we hold your information
The length of time we hold your data depends on a number of factors which must be taken into account with regard to our business needs and legal requirements.
These factors include:
We will keep Personal Data for such time as required by applicable law
We will keep Personal Data for the period of time within which a claim can be made after our contract with a customer ceases- please note that this will vary in different countries 
We may also keep Personal Data for longer in connection with pending or ongoing litigation
4 (v) Consequences of not providing Personal Data 
We need your Personal Data in order to:
Provide our Services to you
Fulfill our contract with you
Comply with our legal obligations
Manage our business for our legitimate interests 
Should you choose not to share your Personal Data with us:
We may not be able to provide you with certain Services that you request.
We may not be able to continue to provide you with or renew existing Services.
==========
4 (vi)  Transfer of Personal Data outside the EEA 
New Relic has self-certified to the Swiss-US and EU-US Privacy Shield.
Please click here to view our Privacy Shield Notice.
If you are based in the EEA, our Personal Data will be accessed by staff or suppliers, transferred, and/or stored outside the EEA, including to the US and other countries which have a lower level of data protection than under EU Data Protection Law.
We must comply with specific rules when we transfer Personal Data from inside the EEA to outside the EEA.
When we do this, we will use appropriate safeguards to protect any Personal Data being transferred.
==========
Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws (see the full list here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm) and therefore no additional safeguards are required to transfer Personal Data to recipients in these countries.
For other countries outside the EEA, we will transfer your Personal Data subject to European Commission-approved contractual terms that impose different data protection obligations directly on the recipient unless we are permitted under EU DP Law to make such transfers without such formalities.
If you are based in the EEA and would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards we apply to the export of your Personal Data, please contact us as set out in the Contact Information section in this Privacy Policy.
4 (vii) EEA Data Subject Rights- if based in the EEA you have certain rights in relation to your Personal Data 
Providing and holding Personal Data comes with significant rights on your part and significant obligations on ours.
If you are based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have several data subject rights in relation to how we use your information.
In addition to the rights outlined in the section “Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data”, under certain conditions, you may have the right under EU data protection laws to ask us to:
provide you with further details on how we use and process your Personal Data
provide you with a copy of your Personal Data that we hold
update any inaccuracies in the Personal Data we hold
delete Personal Data we no longer have grounds to process
restrict how we process your Personal Data whilst we consider an inquiry you have raised
In addition, under certain conditions, you have the right to:
where processing is based on consent, withdraw the consent at any time.
If you withdraw your consent, it will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal
lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
object to any processing of Personal Data that we process on the “legitimate interests” or “public interests” grounds, unless our reasons for the underlying processing outweighs your interests, rights and freedoms; and
object to direct marketing (including any profiling for such purposes) at any time
transfer your information to another provider, known as the right to data portability
If you would like to exercise these rights, please submit your request by completing the Personal Data Request form and submitting it to PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com.
==========
If you have questions please contact AskPrivacy@NewRelic.com.
We will endeavor to respond to without delay.
We may need to ask you additional clarifying questions in order to accurately respond to your request.
If we are unable to deal with your request fully within one month (due to the complexity or number of requests), we may extend this period by a further two months.
Should this be necessary, we will explain the reasons why.
==========
These rights are subject to certain exemptions to safeguards to safeguard the public interest (e.g. the prevention or the detection of crime) and our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege).
We will respond to most requests within one month
Note: If you make your request electronically, we will, where possible, provide the relevant information electronically unless you ask us otherwise.
If we are unable to resolve a query or a complaint, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator/ supervisory authority in the country in which you are based.

==========
Mobile Application 
When you use our New Relic mobile app, we do not ask for access or track any specific location- based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile apps or Services.
We send push notifications to alert you of new activity on New Relic.
If you no longer wish to receive such push communications, please turn them off at the device level.
6.
==========
Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data 
Marketing: we offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data.
We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or the purchase of our Services, subject to your consent if you are based in the EEA.
When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting AskPrivacy@NewRelic.com.
Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we may share your e-mail address with third parties to ensure that you do not receive further communications from third parties.
Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.
==========
Your other rights- If you are based in the EEA please click here to review your choices regarding your Personal Data Data Subject Rights.
Otherwise, you may change any of your Personal Data in your account by editing your profile within the registration portion of our Site or by sending an e-mail to us at the e-mail address set forth below.
You may request deletion of your account information by us by sending an email to support@newrelic.com, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
We will endeavor to respond without delay.
==========
When we delete account information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.
We will otherwise retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services as well as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
7.
==========
Do Not Track 
Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting.
New Relic does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
New Relic takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.
8.
==========
Advertising 
We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites.
Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this Site and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.

Application Data 
a. Types of Application Data We Collect
New Relic collects Application Data when our Services are deployed in your applications.
“Application Data” means data about the performance of your application, system data (such as version data, names of plug-ins, etc.) about the environment in which your application is operating, data about transactions in your application, stack traces and source code snippets for certain classes of errors, and other similar data related to your application.
Application Data is referred to as “Data” under the ToS, and it may include Personal Data.
With respect to the Application Data, our customer is the data controller and New Relic is the data processor.
b. Use of Your Application Data
New Relic shall only process Application Data upon instructions from our customer, including those in the agreement to provide the Services and customer’s configuration of the New Relic Services.
Application Data we collect is primarily used to display application performance information back to the account user.
It is also used by New Relic personnel to answer questions that customers may have about their account and to develop and improve our Services.
==========
New Relic may also aggregate Application Data across multiple accounts and use this data to create and publish industry benchmarks or comparative application performance metrics.
You also have the option of disabling collection of certain types of Application Data collected through our Services, which you may exercise by following the instructions in the user manual for the applicable Services.
c. Disclosure of Your Application Data
We may share your Application Data with third parties to provide technical support or to provide specific services, such as hosting of your applications.
Additionally, New Relic may engage third party sub-processors to process Application Data (that includes Personal Data) in connection with the provision of the Services.
Provided that a customer signs up for notifications at https://newrelic.com/NR-legal-signup-datasubprocessors, New Relic shall provide prior notice of any new sub-processors.
After being notified, customer will have ten (10) business days to notify New Relic in writing of any reasonable objection it has to the new sub-processor(s).
Failure to notify New Relic within this time frame will be deemed approval of the new sub-processor(s).
==========
New Relic may disclose Application Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on New Relic; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of New Relic or users of the Services.
If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Application Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Application Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
d. Security of Your Application Data and Personal Data
New Relic is committed to protecting the security of your Application Data and Personal Data.
We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Application Data and Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
==========
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We also require you to enter a password to access your account information.
Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people.
==========
New Relic also has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the level of security is appropriate to the risk in the performance monitoring and the analytics processing involved in the Services.
Despite these measures, you should know that New Relic cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Application Data and Personal Data and mistakes and security breaches may happen.
If you have any questions about security on our Site or Services, you can contact us at the information below.
