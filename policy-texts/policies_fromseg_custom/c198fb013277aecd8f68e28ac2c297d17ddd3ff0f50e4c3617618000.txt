Adobe and the companies that help us run our business use cookies in several ways, such as:
Authenticating and identifying you on our websites and applications so we can provide you the services you requested
Keeping track of information you have provided to us — for example, keeping items in your shopping cart as you browse the Adobe Store
To provide you the Adobe websites and applications that you use
Remembering your preferences or where you left off in your use of an Adobe website or application
Measuring your use of Adobe websites and applications so that we can improve them, tailor our websites and online services to your likely interests, and conduct market research (learn more or opt out)
Understanding your likely interests so we can provide you more relevant Adobe ads and content on other companies’ websites (learn more or opt out)
Running the Adobe analytics and on-site personalization services, Adobe advertising services, and other Adobe hosted services that we provide to customers.
Our customers use these services to measure your use of their websites or tailor their websites or online ads for you (learn more or opt out).
Technically speaking, cookies are called “HTTP cookies.”
==========
There are other technologies that can be used for similar purposes, such as HTML5 Local Storage and local shared objects (LSOs).
LSOs are used by the authors of files that are read by Adobe® Flash® Player and the websites hosting those files (learn more about Flash Player and LSOs).
We may use HTML5 Local Storage, LSOs, and similar technologies for authenticating you, keeping track of information you have provided to us, and remembering your preferences (see bullet points above).

Web beacons and embedded scripts are other technologies that we use in our websites and applications, as well as in some of our emails and ads.
Web beacons (or “tags”) are bits of programming code included in web pages, emails, and ads that notify Adobe (or the companies that help us run our business) when those web pages, emails, or ads have been viewed or clicked on.
Embedded scripts are bits of programming code included within some of our web pages that measure how you use those web pages, such as which links you click.
We use this information to improve our websites and online services, tailor our websites and online services to your likely interests, and conduct market research.

You may be able to turn off scripting functionality, such as JavaScript, within your browser (please refer to your browser's help function).
Note that if you disable scripting functionality, some Adobe websites and applications may not function properly.
