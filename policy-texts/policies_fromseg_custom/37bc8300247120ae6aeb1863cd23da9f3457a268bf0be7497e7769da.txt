What information do we collect?
We may collect personal information from you when you use this Website.
We may collect or obtain such data because you give it to us (for example in a form on our Website).
We may also collect or obtain personal information from you because we observe or infer that data about you from the way you interact with us or others.
For example, to improve your experience when you use this Website and ensure that it is functioning effectively, we (or our service providers) may use cookies (small text files stored in a user’s browser) and Web beacons which may collect personal information.
Additional information on how we use cookies and other tracking technologies and how you can control these can be found in our cookie notice.
The personal information that we collect or obtain in such circumstances may include: your name; e-mail address; country of residence; employment and education details; your postings on any blogs, forums, wikis and any other social media applications that we provide; your IP address; your browser type and language; your access times; complaint details; details of how you like to interact with us and other similar information.

The personal information we collect may also include so-called ‘sensitive’ or ‘special categories’ of personal information, such as details about your dietary requirements (for example, where we provide you with lunch during a meeting).
The types of personal information and special categories of personal information that we collect may vary depending on how you use our Website.
In some rare circumstances, we might also gather other special categories of personal information about you because you volunteer that data to us or we are required to gather that data as a result of legal requirements imposed on us.

We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy.
Our website and services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children.
It is not our policy to intentionally collect or store information about children.

The legal grounds we use for processing personal information
We are required by law to set out in this privacy statement the legal grounds on which we rely in order to process your personal information.
We use your personal information for the purposes outlined above because of: (a) our legitimate interests in the effective delivery of our Website; (b) our legitimate interests in the effective and lawful operation of our Website so long as such interests are not outweighed by your interests; (c) the legal and regulatory obligations that we are subject to, such as keeping records for tax purposes or providing information to a public body or law enforcement agency.
To the extent that we process any sensitive personal information relating to you for any of the purposes outlined above, we will do so because either: (i) you have given us your explicit consent to process that data; (ii) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or (iii) you have made the data manifestly public.
Where we are legally required to obtain your explicit consent to provide you with certain marketing materials, we will only provide you with such marketing materials where we have obtained such consent from you.
If you do not want to continue receiving any marketing materials from us, you can click on the unsubscribe function in the communication or e-mail.
To whom we disclose your information
In connection with one or more of the purposes outlined in the “How we use information about you” section above, we may disclose details about you to: other members of the Deloitte Network; third parties that provide services to us and/or the Deloitte Network; competent authorities (including courts and authorities regulating us or another member of the Deloitte Network) and other third parties that reasonably require access to personal information relating to you for one or more of the purposes outlined in the “How do we use information about you?”
section above.
==========
Our Website may host various blogs, forums, wikis and other social media applications that allow you to share content with other users (collectively “Social Media Applications”).
Importantly, any personal information that you contribute to these Social Media Applications can be read, collected and used by other users of the application.
We have little or no control over these other users and, therefore, we cannot guarantee that any information that you contribute to any Social Media Applications will be handled in accordance with this privacy statement.
==========
Please note that some of the recipients of your personal information referenced above may be based in countries outside of the European Union whose laws may not provide the same level of data protection.
In such cases, we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal information that comply with our legal obligations.
The adequate safeguard might be a data transfer agreement with the recipient based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal information to third countries.
Further details of the transfers described above and the adequate safeguards used by us in respect of such transfers are also available from us by contacting the Privacy Office.
We may also need to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, by a regulator or during legal proceedings.
We may share non-personal, de-identified and aggregated information with third parties for several purposes, including data analytics, research, submissions, thought leadership and promotional purposes.
