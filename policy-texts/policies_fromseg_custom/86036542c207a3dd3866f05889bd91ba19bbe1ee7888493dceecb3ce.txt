What Information We May Collect
When you use our Services, we may collect "Personal information," which is any information that can be used to identify a particular individual which can include traditional identifiers such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and non-traditional identifiers such as unique device identifiers and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
We may collect personal information that you or other users give us (e.g. your contact details or your comments or opinions), allow us to receive either through your preferences in your devices (e.g. location data) or browser or from third parties such as social networks (e.g. your public profile information) or through use of our Services (e.g. the pages you visit).

We collect Personal Information about our users in several ways.
Personal Information You Provide to Us
Most of the Personal Information we receive comes to us voluntarily from our users in the course of using our Services.
==========
For example, Personal Information may be collected when you:

Register or log in to our Services;
Participate in activities available through our Services such as a sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers;
Sign up for a newsletter;
Provide information to our customer service representatives or contact us through our Services;
Use our message boards and other public forums available through our Services;
Use any social networking features available through our Services and create a profile or share information about yourself;

Personal Information Collected Via Technology
As you use our Services, we may collect passive information through the use of cookies, web beacons, log file information and other tracking technologies, including your IP address, browser type, device type, device ID, geolocation data, Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and operating system   

      We use this technology and identifiers to better understand how you interact with our Services.
In particular, we gather information on the date and time you connect or engage with our Services, the products you reviewed, the areas of our Services you interact with any referring or destination pages or websites.
==========
This information allows us to better understand our users and to enhance your experience.
For example, when you return to our website after visiting another site, cookies allow our website to remember who you are and any preferences you have.
For more information on who we use cookies, please see our cookie policy.
==========
In addition, collecting information such as device type allows us to optimize settings for your system remotely.
Personal Information We Receive From Others
We may receive Personal Information about users from third parties such as web analytics vendors, social media sites, law enforcement agencies and marketing consultants.
This information supplements any information that we have collected directly from our users, and allows us to customize our Services to better serve you.
Sometimes, we may receive Personal Information about people who are not yet users of our Services.
NVIDIA's policy is to treat all information obtained from third parties in the same manner that we treat information that we have collected ourselves.
Why We Collect Personal Information
The Personal Information we collect helps us: 

provide our Services  to you;
process transactions; 
respond to requests  or any correspondence you send us;
 and learn about our users' interests in terms  of the features, performance and support of our products;
customize your experience  (including the content and advertisements delivered on our websites);
to enhance and  develop our Services;
to protect and  enforce our rights and the rights of our users and third parties;
market our products  and services to you through newsletters or promotional e-mails or push  notifications (Please see the section below on Your Choices Regarding Your  Personal Information.)
==========

Any Personal Information we collect may be shared with NVIDIA's corporate affiliates, or companies who operate under the same corporate control.
NVIDIA will take reasonable steps to ensure that these company affiliates honor this Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy.
We may, from time to time, share your Personal Information with third party business partners, vendors, affiliates, and other service providers that perform services on our behalf, in order to carry out their work for us, which may include identifying and serving targeted advertisements, e-commerce, content or service fulfillment, website operations, email communications management, customer service, analytics, manufacturing, integration, delivery, support, payment, and servicing processes.
NVIDIA's policy is to prohibit these companies from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide the services expressly requested by NVIDIA.
We may with your prior consent share your Personal Information with business partners who offer a service jointly with us, for example, when running a co-sponsored contest or promotion, or offering a co-branded product or service.
==========
NVIDIA may sell or buy assets from or to other companies.
Personal information may be one of the transferred business assets, and would likely be one of the transferred assets in the event that NVIDIA or some of its assets were acquired.
If NVIDIA or its assets are acquired by another company, NVIDIA will request that the acquiring company assumes the obligations of this Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy.
We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on NVIDIA; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of NVIDIA or users of our website.
==========
NVIDIA may "de-personalize" Personal Information by removing personally identifiable characteristics, such as name and email address, and aggregate data for use in surveys or other business purposes.
NVIDIA may then use and/or share this de-personalized information with third parties to improve our Services.
Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information
NVIDIA respects your choices about how your Personal Information is used when you register with us, elect to receive our newsletters, or provide us with Personal Information for other purposes.
If you choose not to provide any Personal Information when requested, you can still enjoy most aspects of our Services.
However, you may be unable to access certain areas and services that require our interaction with you.
==========
Marketing communications.
You can opt-out of receiving communications from NVIDIA at any time by unsubscribing at https://profile.nvidia.com/en-us/login, or by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any e-mail or SMS communications you receive.
If you are using our apps we may also send you push notifications which you can opt out of receiving using the app settings.
However, we may still send you updates to our Legal Notices, Online Privacy Policy, or regarding any account you have created with us.
==========
Online advertising and other tracking.
As discussed above, NVIDIA  collects certain information about you when you use our Services through  technology such as cookies, web beacons and similar tools.
Because we use this information only for  internal and analytic purposes, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option  provided by your browser will not have any effect on our collection of cookie  information for these purposes.
The only  way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through  cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your  browser or mobile device.
To learn more  about cookies, please read our cookie policy at http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/cookie-policy-uk.html.
We permit third party ad networks and social media companies to use cookies, plug-ins and other technology to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites when you visit our Site.
For example, we use advertising services provided by third party ad partners to employ cookies and other tracking technology to market our services to you on other websites.
==========
We do not control the opt-out mechanisms of these third party ad partners.
To avoid tracking by these third party ad partners, you can change your browser settings to reject cookies or to notify you when cookies are set and you could select the Do Not Track option on your browser, though we have no control over and cannot confirm whether these third parties honor the Do Not Track browser signal.
Additionally, many advertising companies who operate in the United States are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) which provide opt-outs for member companies at www.networkadvertising.org/choices  or www.aboutads.info/choices.
