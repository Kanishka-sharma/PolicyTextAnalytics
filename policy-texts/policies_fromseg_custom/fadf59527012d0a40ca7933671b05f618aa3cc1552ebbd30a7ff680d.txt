Privacy Policy
Last Updated May 11, 2007
Welcome to Slide, a personal online service operated by Slide Inc. ("Slide")
which includes Slide software, content, related documentation, information on 
the Slide domain, and information made available by users to each other through 
the Slide software (collectively, the "Service").
Your privacy is important to us 
and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect 
information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others.
This Privacy Policy 
explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally 
identifying information.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have 
any questions, feel free to contact us.
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information 
as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time.
We 
may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice that changes have been 
made on the website www.slide.com.
You should visit this page periodically to review any 
changes to the Privacy Policy.
==========
What We Collect

When you register to become a member of Slide, you can create an anonymous account, or 
you can give us your email address and create a registered account.
If you create a 
registered account, we collect your email address and the user name you create.
We may also offer you the opportunity to submit other personally identifiable
information (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code,
etc.), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.
In addition to personally identifiable information, you may submit other content 
("Content"), such as blogs (web logs), titles in your media library, photos and other 
media, each of which you present through technology available at Slide ("Slide Shows").
It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this additional
information, and whether you would like to make it or your Slide Shows
available to others.
==========
To protect your privacy, the Service allows you to mark
your Content as “Private”, in which event it can only be seen by
you and people with whom the unique URL of your Content has been shared.
However, Slide has no responsibility for how people you allow to view your
Content (or the public if you make any information available to the public)
use that material, or to whom they may forward it.
Moreover, if you "embed" a
Slide Show on another web page, it will be visible to the public in accordance
with the policies of that web page, regardless of whether you have restricted
access to that Slide Show on Slide.
==========
When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Slide service, 
we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, 
including email addresses and content.
Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make
certain internal reports, we collect aggregate information about the use of
the Service, including information about users accessing the Slide site or
viewing Slide shows on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses,
browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform
type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the
order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the
date and time.
How We Use Your Information

We do not sell or rent your personally identifying information to any third party.
==========
We make your profile available to other users according to the privacy
settings you set for yourself as part of your profile.
Your user name will be
identified to us and to any recipient of messages you send through the
Service.
We also use your name, email address and other information on our
system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to
solicit your feedback and input.
In the event that we decide to allow you to
submit other information about yourself, the availability of that information
to other users will also be controlled by privacy settings you will set for
yourself.
In the event that you make your Slide Shows publicly available, or
“embed” them on another publicly available web site (such as a
social networking site), we may include links to those shows or web sites or
otherwise identify them in our marketing materials as places where Slide Shows
that may interest other users can be found.
==========
You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your
personal information and the contents of your account if required to do so by
law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is
reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as
a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights
and property, or that of our affiliates or the public.
Slide is not required
to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other
similar governmental request that Slide receives.
Slide may maintain copies
of your content indefinitely, or delete certain content in whole or in part if
Slide determines, in its sole discretion, that such content constitutes an
"Infringing Posting" or a "Prohibited Posting" as defined in our Terms of Use or for any or
no reason.
We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information 
about your computer and your access of the Service (including your internet protocol address) 
in order to operate, maintain and manage the Service.
Slide may disclose personally identifiable information to its partners in
order to provide the Service, resolve service problems and correct errors in
the Service, to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you with
advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service, and to
enhance your experience on the Service.
==========
However, we do not give our partners
an independent right to share this information.
Due to our contractual
obligations with these third parties and the need to share personally
identifiable information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide
you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing personally identifiable
information with these third parties.
Slide, certain of its partners, and
each of their contractors and employees may view the Content that you upload
to the Service in order to provide the Service and otherwise perform the tasks
set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Controlling Your Personal Information

Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing personal
information, that information may be collected and used by others.
==========
The
Service provides a number of tools that you can use to control the
availability of your profile and other personal information.
You can edit
your profile and other information at any time through the Slide software.
You can also adjust your profile and the privacy setting of each Slide Show
you've created using the Slide software so that only you, your friends, and/or
friends of friends with whom the unique URL of your Content has been shared
may view your information or Slide Shows, or you can make that information
available to everyone.
Moreover, if you “embed” a Slide Show on
another web page, it will be visible to the public in accordance with the
policies of that web page, regardless of whether you have restricted access to
that Slide Show on Slide.
Slide has no responsibility for how people you
allow to view your Content (or the public if you make any information
available to the public) use that material, or to whom they may forward it.
You can terminate your account at any time which will remove your profile and other 
personal information from view.
Slide, however, may (but is not obligated to) keep 
information about you that is on its system following your termination.
Contact Slide 
to terminate your account or for any other questions about your personal information.
Transfer of Information

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer 
of ownership of Slide, such as acquisition by or merger with another company.
==========
In such 
an event, Slide will notify users who have provided email addresses when information 
about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Others' Information

You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be 
invited to join Slide.
We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind 
that person that he or she has been invited to join Slide.
All invitees are provided 
with the option not to receive further invitations from Slide.
We may disclose such 
information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described 
above.
==========
Cookies

The Slide Service sends "cookies" to your computer when you access the Slide
site, or otherwise view content through a Slide Show and uses such cookies as
described here.
The Service uses cookies to improve the quality of our
service and make the Service easier to use for our members.
A cookie is a
small text file recorded on your hard drive that identifies you as a unique
user and contains certain information about your particular login session
and/or your use of the Service.
Use of Information

Slide may contain links to other web sites, and images in Slide Shows may be
hosted by other web sites.
These other sites maintain their own policies
regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information.
It is up
to you to review those policies yourself.
==========
Finally, you should be aware that
when you “embed” a Slide Show on another web site, the
availability of that Slide Show to the general public will be governed by the
policies of that web site.
Third-Party Advertising Companies

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site and on
certain Slide Shows.
Our system and the third-party advertising technology
uses information derived from your visits to our site and the Slide Shows that
you view to target advertising within our site or Slide Shows.
In addition,
our advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target
advertising on our site and other sites.
In the course of advertisements
being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on
your computer.
Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us
with pixel tags (also called “clear gifs” or
“beacons”) to help manage and optimize our online advertising.
Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the
site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users
to a given site.
To “opt-out”, please click 
here.
Slide does not provide any personally identifiable information to third-party
advertising companies.
Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Slide to show
an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women
ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have
viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the
third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics
of the audience that they are trying to reach.
==========
Security

We use industry standard security measures to protect your information so that it is 
not made available to unauthorized parties.
If you have any questions regarding which 
measures and techniques we use, feel free to contact us.
Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions

From time to time you may be able to participate in contests, giveaways,
sweepstakes or other similar promotions we sponsor.
Participation may require
sharing your personal information with us or third parties sponsoring of the
contest, giveaway, or promotion, and you should check the rules to determine
how your information will be used and shared with others.
If a third party
administers the contest, your participation may be subject to additional terms
and conditions and that third party's privacy policy.
==========
We are not responsible
for such third parties.
You should carefully review these third parties' terms
and conditions.
Additional Questions

Again, feel free to contact us by sending an email to 
webmaster@slide.com
, any time, if 
you have further questions about Slide or this Privacy Policy.
