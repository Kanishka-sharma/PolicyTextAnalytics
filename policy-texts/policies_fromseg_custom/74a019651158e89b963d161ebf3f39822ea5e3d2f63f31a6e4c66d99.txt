Introduction
Bidstack Limited (“Bidstack“, “we“, “us” or “our“) is a cross-platform in-game advertising provider, whose technology enables video game companies and advertisers to create advertising opportunities in-game (the “Platform”).
Game developers and publishers can integrate adverts into the game environment using our SDK and advertisers can use our technology to buy space and run targeted campaigns within the video game.
Bidstack uses information provided to it by game publishers and developers to create user profiles and audiences.
This means that Bidstack tailors advertising to users based on this information and may use certain information to enable it to identify where the same user is playing different video games which use Bidstack’s services.
Bidstack respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information we receive.
Please read this privacy policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are and how and why we collect, store, use and share your personal information.
It also explains your rights in relation to your personal information, how you can opt out of targeted advertising served by Bidstack and how to contact us.
