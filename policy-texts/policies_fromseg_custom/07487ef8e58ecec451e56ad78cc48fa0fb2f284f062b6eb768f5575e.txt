You do not need to create a PlayStation®Network ("PSN") account with us in order to view the Sites.
However, if you already have a PSN account or if you create one, you will have access to more of the features on our Sites, as well as access to the PSN online community – which allows you to play games online and buy content and services, like new levels for your favorite games, movies, television shows or original programs.
If you do not already have a PSN account, you can create one here: http://www.us.playstation.com/psn/signup/.
Note that if you do choose to create a PSN account, you will need to agree to a separate Terms of Service and User Agreement ("ToSUA") and Privacy Policy that govern PSN.
When you login to your PSN account while on one of our Sites, the PSN ToSUA and Privacy Policy also apply to your activities on that Site to the extent they do not conflict with these Terms of Service.
Except for any internet fees that you are responsible for, creating a PSN account is free, so we encourage you to do so.

YOUR COPYRIGHTED WORK
Just  as Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. (“SCEA”) requires users of our  Sites to respect our copyrights and those of our affiliates, licensors and  business partners, we respect the copyrights of others.
To that end, we have  adopted this Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act (“Copyright Act”) (17 U.S.C. 512 et seq.).
Once  SCEA’s representative who has been designated to receive notification of  claimed copyright infringement (“Designated Agent”) – whose name and contact  information is noted below – receives proper notice of the alleged  infringement, or if SCEA otherwise comes to believe in good faith that any specific  content, including user generated content, on the Sites contain material that  infringes copyright (“Disputed Content”), SCEA may (1) promptly remove or block  access to the Disputed Content or (2) deny access to the Sites to users that  repeatedly violate copyright or other intellectual property rights.
SCEA will  take reasonable steps to notify a user who has uploaded Disputed Content if  that Disputed Content is subsequently removed or disabled.
Procedure  for Reporting Copyright Infringement:
If  you believe in good faith that your copyrighted work has been reproduced on the  Site without authorization in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,  you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may notify our Designated  Agent:

A  statement made under penalty of perjury that the information in the  notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the  owner of an exclusive right under the Copyright Act that is allegedly  infringed.
Supplying  a Counter-Notice Regarding Alleged Copyright Infringement
If  you are the provider of the Disputed Content and believe a copyright  infringement notice has been wrongly submitted against you as a result of  mistake or a misidentification of the claimed copyrighted material, you may  send a counter-notification to our Designated Agent (whose address is included  in Paragraph 1 above).
The counter notification must provide the following  information:

==========
If  our Designated Agent receives a counter-notice from you, SCEA will send a copy  of it to the original complaining party informing that person or entity that  SCEA may replace the removed Disputed Content or cease disabling access to it.
Please note that when we forward the counter-notice, it includes your personal  information.
By submitting a counter-notice, you consent to having your  information revealed in this way.
We will not forward the counter-notice to any  party other than the complaining party.
Unless  the Designated Agent receives notice from the original complaining party that  the original complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to  restrain the user who posted the Disputed Content from engaging in infringing  activity relating to the Disputed Content on the Site, SCEA will replace or  restore access to the Disputed Content on the Site or permit the user to  re-post the Disputed Content.

If all requested information is provided, a separate email containing a code will be sent to the Master Account’s email account with instructions to complete registration by entering the code into the Sub Account using a personal computer.
You will need to create for your child an Online ID that will be associated with the child’s PSN Sub Account.
Please note that the Online ID is publicly available to and viewable by all PSN users and your child may receive text emails from any PSN users, including adults, in your child’s PSN account mailbox.
The parent’s Master Account will not be notified of such text emails sent to a child’s Sub Account mailbox.

Please consider your child’s age and check any content ratings and descriptions where available, before you access, download or purchase access to any items or permit your child to do so.
In some cases, third parties provide ratings or descriptions for items, and SCEA therefore cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information.

In addition, not all content is rated.
Some content that you access on your PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system, PSP  (PlayStation Portable) system or other SCEA-authorized may be accessible by all users of that system.

Parental controls may also not apply to some content that is not rated.
Your child may not be able to access some content or play games rated for users older than his or her registered age.
In some countries, parents and legal guardians with Master Accounts will be permitted to set their parental controls to override content restrictions on certain materials for associated Sub Accounts.

If you, or anyone in your family has an epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your physician before playing.
IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE use and consult your physician before resuming play.
If you or your child experience any of the following health problems or symptoms: 
	
dizziness
altered vision
eye or muscle twitches
loss of awareness
disorientation
seizures or any involuntary movement or convulsion.
RESUME PLAY ONLY ON APPROVAL OF YOUR PHYSICIAN.

3D DEVICE USE NOTICE 
Some people may experience discomfort (such as eye strain, eye fatigue or nausea) while watching 3D video images or playing stereoscopic 3D games on 3D televisions.
If you experience such discomfort, you should immediately discontinue use of your television until the discomfort subsides.
SCEA recommends that all viewers take regular breaks while watching 3D video or playing stereoscopic 3D games.
The length and frequency of necessary breaks may vary from person to person.
Please take breaks that are long enough to allow any feelings of discomfort to subside.

If symptoms persist, consult a doctor.
The vision of young children (especially those under six years old) is still under development.
SCEA recommends that you consult your doctor (such as a pediatrician or eye doctor) before allowing young children to watch 3D video images or play stereoscopic 3D games.
Adults should supervise young children to ensure they follow the recommendations listed above.
