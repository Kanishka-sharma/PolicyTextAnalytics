CSN Gift Certificate Terms and Conditions
 
            The following terms and conditions (the "Terms") apply to any CSN electronic gift certificate originally purchased by you or someone 
            on your behalf (the "gift certificate") through the CSN Stores web site.
Gift certificates are issued by CSN Stores, LLC (referred 
            to hereinafter as either "CSN Stores", "we", "us" or "our").
By purchasing a gift certificate, accepting and retaining a gift certificate,
             or using a gift certificate, you agree to these Terms.
Gift certificates are only valid in the United States of America and Canada.
==========
Void where prohibited.
Gift certificates can only be redeemed through one of the CSN Stores websites, as listed on 
                http://www.csnstores.com/ourstores.php
Gift certificates cannot be used to purchase gift certificates or gift cards.
Gift certificates are not redeemable for cash and cannot be returned for a cash refund, except to the extent required by law.
==========
Use of the gift certificate is limited to the amount of funds held on the gift certificate.
The full amount of each purchase, 
                  including taxes, will be deducted from the funds held on the gift certificate, up to the total funds available on the gift 
                  certificate.
Any unused balance will be placed in the recipient's gift certificate account and is not transferable.
If you 
                  make a purchase and there are insufficient funds held on the gift certificate to cover that purchase, you must pay the difference 
                  by a valid credit card or debit card.
To the extent permitted by law, the original expiration date will apply to any unused 
                  balance.
==========
The risk of loss and title for gift certificates pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the purchaser.
We are not responsible for and will not replace lost or stolen gift certificates.
Protect your gift certificate as if it were 
                  cash and safeguard the gift certificate from authorized use.
CSN Stores may provide gift certificate purchasers with information about the redemption status of gift certificates.
==========
CSN Stores reserves the right to change these Terms from time to time in its discretion.
Such revised terms will be effective 
                  as to any gift certificates purchased after the date said revised Terms are posted to the CSN Stores websites.
Resale of a gift certificate or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes is 
                  strictly prohibited.
Your right to use the funds on the gift certificate is a limited right, subject to these Terms and 
                  applicable law.
==========
We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors, in any offer and reserve the right to
                   cancel any orders resulting from such errors.
If we suspect any fraud or misuse in connection with a gift certificate, we reserve the right in our discretion to suspend 
                  or terminate use of the gift certificate.
The consideration paid for the gift certificate, including any unredeemed balances, is the property of the CSN Stores.
We do not currently collect or maintain any personally identifiable information regarding the purchasers of the Cards.
However, we reserve the right to obtain personal information about you in accordance with the privacy policy found 
                  here 
                  if such information is necessary to service the Card or respond to your inquiries or for other purposes.
==========
If any one or more of the covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of these Terms shall be for any reason whatsoever held 
                  invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements, 
                  provisions or terms of these Terms shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of these Terms.
These Terms sets forth the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and all prior understandings,
                   written or oral, are superseded by these Terms.
All terms and conditions set forth herein are applicable to the extent permitted by
                    law.

Becoming a Supplier

Interested In Being a Supplier?
The Internet has created a tremendous opportunity for manufacturers to drive additional revenue growth and reach a new and growing set 
          of customers.
For seven years, we have enabled our suppliers to successfully tap into this growth while working closely with them to 
          protect and promote their brand, complement their existing retail channels and facilitate smooth logistics and communications flow.
We understand the importance of flexibility and tailor our approach to meet our suppliers' specific needs.
We value our 2,000+ supplier relationships and believe these to be the key elements to fostering a successful partnership: 
          

Commitment to Growth – Our goal is to rapidly grow revenues and become the top online channel partner for each of our 
          suppliers.
==========
Our category teams' significant product expertise combined with our ongoing investment in online, email and traditional 
          marketing, ensures maximum impact as we launch new suppliers' products.
Partnership in Customer Service Excellence – CSN Stores' ability to provide great customer service begins with our 
          supplier's commitment to ship orders quickly, package products with care, provide accurate in-stock status and work with us to rapidly 
          handle any issues that may arise.
Brand and Channel Integrity – CSN Stores is absolutely committed to helping its suppliers' brand flourish online.
We collaborate with our suppliers to tell their products' stories the way they want them told.
==========
We are sensitive to our suppliers' 
          desire to have a consistent value proposition and brand message across all of their retail outlets and we work 
          closely to ensure our relationship is complementary to our suppliers' existing sales channels.
Flexibility and Ease – Each of our suppliers works closely with a CSN Stores category team that is highly 
          proficient at taking the supplier though the entire process of: (1) establishing the relationship, (2) effectively merchandising the product,
          (3) driving growth and (4) providing excellent customer service.
We understand that every supplier may have unique needs in areas of 
          logistics, order flow, payments, returns, etc. and we try to tune our approach to match our suppliers' needs and to make the entire 
          process as smooth and seamless as possible.
