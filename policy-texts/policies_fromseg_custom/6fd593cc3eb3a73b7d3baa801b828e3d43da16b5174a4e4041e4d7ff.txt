A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other
  Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to
  store information or settings in the browser.
A “Flash cookie,” also known as
  a local shared object, functions like a web cookie to personalize a user’s
  experience on sites that use Adobe Flash Player.
A “web beacon,” also known as
  an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and
  their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through
  cookies back to a web server.
We and our third-party service providers may use
  beacons in emails to help us track response rates, identify when our emails
  are accessed or forwarded, and for other purposes listed above.
==========
To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before
  placing cookies or similar technologies on your computer.
You can stop certain
  types of cookies from being downloaded on your computer by selecting the
  appropriate settings on your web browser.
Most web browsers will tell you how
  to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a
  new browser cookie and how to disable existing cookies.
You can find out how
  to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s
  menu or by visiting

  your browser settings and instead must be managed through your Adobe Flash
  Player settings.

  Services.
The following types of cookies and similar technologies may be used on the

Internal Cookies Essential For The Services To Function

  to (1) keep track of preferences you specify while you use the Services, (2)
  access your information when you log into the Services to provide you with
  customized content and (3) manage the security of the Services.
Third-Party Web Analytics Cookies

  Through our Services, we may obtain personal information about your online
  activities over time and across third-party apps, websites, devices and other
  online services.
On our Services, we use third-party online analytics
  services, such as those of Google Analytics.
The service providers that
  administer these analytics services use automated technologies to collect data
  (such as email address, IP addresses, cookies and other device identifiers) to
  evaluate, for example, use of our Services and to diagnose technical issues.
To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit
  www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.
In addition, our apps use Appsee’s analytics SDK (Software Development
  Kit), a third-party app analytics tool integrated into the code of our apps.
We use this tool in a way that only analytics data is captured.
The
  information collected includes technical information about your mobile device
  and aggregated app usage data, such as your device IP address, operating
  system version, device type and model, app usage length, touch gestures
  performed in the app, gesture responsiveness and gesture start and end times.
This information is hosted by Appsee and shared with us for analytics
  purposes.
==========
We use this information solely for those purposes in order to
  understand how you use our apps and improve our app functionality.
Internal and Third-Party Advertising Cookies

  Through our Services, both we and certain third parties may collect
  information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about
  products and services tailored to your individual interests.
You may see our
  ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising
  networks.
Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering
  demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context.
These
  networks track users’ online activities over time by collecting information
  through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web
  beacons, device identifiers, server logs, web beacons and other similar
  technologies.
The networks use this information to show ads that may be
  tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across
  multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing
  and app usage activities.
The information our ad networks may collect includes
  data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant
  ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the
  websites or apps.
This data collection takes place both on our Services and on
  third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks.
This
  process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

We may allow certain third parties (such as certain

      (such as an enhanced ability to serve you content and advertisements that
      may be of interest to you).
You have the right to opt out of this

During the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this California
      Consumer Privacy Statement, we may have sold the following categories of
      personal information:
    


Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique

          number, unique pseudonym, or user alias; telephone number and other
          forms of persistent or probabilistic identifiers), online identifier,

Inferences drawn from any of the information identified above to
          create a profile about you reflecting your preferences,
          characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior,
          attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.
==========
We do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age
      without affirmative authorization if we have actual knowledge of the
      individual’s age.
d. Disclosure of Personal Information for a Business Purpose


      We may have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose the
      categories of personal information listed in Section 1 of this Statement.
==========
California Consumer Privacy Rights

    You have certain choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal
    information, as described below.
Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period,
      that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used,
      disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.
Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain
      personal information we have collected from you.
Opt-Out of Sale: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your
      personal information.
Shine the Light Request: You also may have the right to request
      that we provide you with (a) a list of certain categories of personal
      information we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing
      purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (b) the
      identity of those third parties.

==========
Verifying Requests: To help protect your privacy and
    maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before
    granting you access to your personal information or complying with your
    request.
If you have an account with us, we verify your identity by
    requiring you to sign in to your account.
If you do not have an account with
    us and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, there
    is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of
    certainty required by the CCPA.
==========
The reason for this is that iHerb
    historically has not linked IP addresses, device identifiers or other
    information collected by automated means to named actual persons.
Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, and you request access
    to or deletion of your personal information, we will not be able to process
    your request at this time.
Additional Information: If you choose to exercise
    any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive
    discriminatory treatment by us.
To the extent permitted by applicable law,
    we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
