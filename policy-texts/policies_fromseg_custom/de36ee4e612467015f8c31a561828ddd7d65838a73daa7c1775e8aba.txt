Bayer is aware that the security of your private information from the use of our website is an important concern.
We take the protection of your personal data very seriously.
Therefore we would like you to know what data we maintain and what data we discard.
With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about our security measures.
Collection of Data
You can use our website without disclosing your personal data.
==========
You are not required to provide personal information as a condition of using our site, except as may be necessary to provide you a product or service at your request.
When you use our website, data may be stored for various security purposes.
This data may include the name of your internet service provider, the website that you used to link to our site, the websites that you visit from our site and your IP-Address.
==========
This data could possibly lead to your identification, but we do not use it to do so.
We do use the data from time to time for statistical purposes, but maintain the anonymity of each individual user so that the person cannot be identified.
==========
In cases when personal data is provided to others to provide you products or services you have requested, or for other purposes you have authorized, we rely on technical and organizational means to assure that applicable data security regulations are followed.
Collection and Processing of Personal Data
We collect personal data only when you provide it to us, through registration, completion of forms or e-mails, as part of an order for products or services, inquiries or requests about materials being ordered and similar situations in which you have chosen to provide the information to us.
==========
The database and its contents remain at our company and stay with data processors or servers acting on our behalf and responsible to us.
Your personal data will not be passed on by us or by our agents for use by third parties in any form whatsoever, unless we have obtained your consent or are legally required to do so.
We will retain control of and responsibility for the use of any personal data you disclose to us.
==========
Some of this data may be stored or processed at computers located in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live.
In such cases, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the data that are equivalent to those that apply in the country in which you live.
