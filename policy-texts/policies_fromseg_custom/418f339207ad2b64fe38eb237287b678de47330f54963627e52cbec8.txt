PRIVACY SHIELD
With respect to transfers from Europe, while the European Court of Justice has held that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is no longer “adequate” for the transfer of personal data from Europe to the U.S., GoFundMe continues to abide by the privacy principles and other requirements of the Privacy Shield with respect to personal data we collect in the U.S. from data subjects in Europe.
In addition, GoFundMe has implemented other appropriate cross-border transfer solutions, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to provide adequate protection for transfers of certain personal data from the EU to the U.S.
GoFundMe has certified with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of “personal data” (as defined under the Privacy Shield principles) from Europe.
GoFundMe has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement for such personal data.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield list by clicking here.
==========
As required under the principles, when GoFundMe receives information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on GoFundMe’s behalf, GoFundMe has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) GoFundMe is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
If you have any questions or complaints about GoFundMe’s privacy practices, including questions related to the Privacy Shield, you can contact us at the email address or mailing address set forth under “Contacting GoFundMe.”
==========
We will work with you to resolve your issue.
If you are in Europe and are dissatisfied with the manner in which we have addressed your concerns about our privacy practices, you can seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism, the JAMS Privacy Shield Program, which you can learn more about by visiting https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.
Residents of Europe can elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, you must: (1) contact GoFundMe and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from GoFundMe’s designated independent recourse mechanism above; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue.
