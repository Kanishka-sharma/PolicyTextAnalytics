This document provides information about our digital advertising technology platform (the Platform), which enables our clients to buy and sell digital advertising, and then describes our policies about data collection and use.
==========
Our goal is to be transparent about our business by describing our technology in simple terms so that Internet users can understand our practices.
We know that this is complicated, so if you have any questions about this information, please contact us here.What is the Audigent Platform?Audigent is not an ad network or a data broker.
Audigent is a digital advertising technology platform.
By "platform," we mean a technology that provides tools for advertisers, or buyers, to purchase ad space and influencers to connect advertisers with audiences.
Buyers want to use their advertising dollars efficiently by reaching the right audiences, and by measuring the effectiveness of their ads.
To accomplish these goals, buyers use our Platform to engage in a variety of digital advertising techniques, including interest-based advertising, real-time (or programmatic) advertising, contextual, and location-based advertising.
==========
The Platform is operated by Predictive Pop Inc. d/b/a Audigent, 200 Varick St., Suite 514, New York, NY, 10014, USA.What Do We Mean by Platform Data?The Platform is designed to use certain types of data, that all together we call Platform Data.
It includes data generated through the Platform as well as data clients receive from other sources and then use on the Platform, or that they buy or sell through the Platform.
==========
This may include information about Internet users’ browsers and devices, such as:
      
      the type of browser and its settings, information about the device’s operating system, cookie information, information about other identifiers assigned to the device, and the IP address from which the device accesses a client’s website or mobile application - where we are entitled by law to do so, information about the user’s activity on that device, including web pages and mobile apps visited or usedinformation about the geographic location of the device when it accesses a website or mobile application inferences or information about users’ interests that are created, acquired, bought, sold, or used by our clients.
Most of the data that the Platform receives from browsers and devices might also be called “HTTP header data” or “clickstream data.”
We do not allow data that by itself identifies an individual, such as name, address, phone number, email address, or government identifier, to be stored or used on the Platform.
Audigent does not allow data that directly identifies an individual to be collected or used on the Platform.Glossary of Basic TermsAd ServerAn ad server, in its simplest form, is the computer responsible for delivering an ad to be shown in a web page or a mobile app.
Today, communications may be sent to several servers in the process of selecting and delivering an ad.
This occurs in a matter of milliseconds (thousandths of a second).
==========
Beacons, Pixels, Tags, and SDKsBeacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags are elements included in web pages to enable companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measuring ad effectiveness or preventing fake ad traffic.
They do this by allowing communication between a web browser and a server.
A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page.
A tag is a small piece of website code that is run by the web browser.
An SDK is a piece of computer code that developers include in their mobile applications.CookieA cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server.
By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize web browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.Non-Cookie TechnologyCompanies sometimes use alternative methods that perform functions similar to cookies in order to identify unique browsers or devices.
For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising.
==========
Additionally, mathematical or statistical techniques are sometimes used to try to identify devices.
These "Statistical Identifiers" are not 100% accurate.
==========
Non-Cookie Technology may be utilized both for Ad Delivery and Reporting (ADR), and as part of Interest-Based Advertising (IBA)ID Syncing:ID synching (sometimes also referred to as cookie synching) is a common and long-standing process in the digital advertising industry.
It enables advertisers to link up data from multiple advertising platforms, and helps advertisers buy ads in more than one place.
Here’s an example of how it works.
==========
Let’s say you sell a product on your website.
A customer visits your site.
Your website stores a cookie to identify that customer’s browser, and the cookie contains an ID of 12345.
You then associate that ID with information about what the customer shopped for on your site.
==========
If you want to then use that information to advertise to that user, you might go to an online advertising marketplace to buy ads.
In order to buy the right ads and show them to the right user, you’ll need to match your ID, which is 12345 to the ID that the marketplace has assigned to the same customer (which let’s say for this example is ABCDE).
The result is a record that says ID 12345 = Marketplace ID ABCDE.
That way, when the marketplace offers to sell you an ad to be shown to ABCDE, your system will know that ABCDE is the same as 12345, and you can pick the right ad to show the customer.Cross-Device MappingCross-device mapping is the process of making inferences that certain devices are related to each other (i.e. that they belong to the same user or household).
==========
This is done using either “statistical” or “deterministic” methods (or a combination).
“Statistical” refers to using mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses that certain devices are related.
==========
“Deterministic” means using known relationships, for example logins that use the same email address or other personal information, to link multiple devices to a single user.
When this method is used companies typically mask the actual email address.Interest-based AdvertisingInterest-based advertising (IBA) uses information collected across multiple web sites or mobile apps to predict users' preferences and to show ads that are most likely to be of interest to them.
For example, if a user visits a travel site or uses a travel app, she might see travel-related ads on another site or app.
Advertisers may also use other information they have or can acquire about users’ interests.
==========
Users have choices with respect to this type of advertising, as discussed below.Precise Geographic LocationYour device may be capable of sharing your precise geographic location with the apps or web pages you visit using that device.
Devices use one or more methods to determine your location, including GPS coordinates and information about wi-fi networks in your vicinity.
(Geographic location determined from IP address is typically not considered to be “precise.”)
Devices such as iPhone or Android phones typically ask for users’ consent before installing or using an app that accesses the device’s precise geographic location.
==========
The app, in turn, may make this information available to third-party advertising companies in order to make the ads you see more relevant.Real-Time Transactions (Also called Real-Time Bidding or Programmatic Advertising):Advertising buyers are able to bid in "real time" for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded or an app is used.
The winning bidder gets to show its ad.
==========
Of course, the explanations above are simplified.
There are many resources available on the web to learn more about these concepts and online advertising in general.

==========
When clients remove their data from the Platform, their storage and retention of data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.What are your choices?The choices and means Audigent offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal data include:
Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising: You can opt out of interest-based advertising.
Click below to opt out of having the Platform used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behavior.
When you opt out, an opt out cookie (from audigent.com) will be stored in your web browser.
The Platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt out cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies using the Platform.
==========
If you block or delete the opt out cookie, you will not be opted out and will need to allow cookies from Audigent and renew your opt-out choice.
Opt Out Important things to note about the opt out: Blocked cookies: The opt out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
Deleting or protecting opt outs: If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again.
There are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt out cookies.
For more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/PMC.
==========
Only this browser: The opt out only applies to the browser profile in which you set it.
For example, if you set the opt out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt out will not be active in Chrome.
To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt out process.
This is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.
The opt out does not block or delete cookies: It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior.
==========
If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising.
Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown.
If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.
==========
Learn More: To learn more about interest-based advertising, and to access the opt outs of other online advertising companies, visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.
