Effective 
              March 5, 2004: 
About 
              MySpace.com 
              MySpace.com is an online service that allows our members to set 
              up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through 
              networks of friends.
MySpace members can view each others' profiles, 
              communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, 
              share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests.
To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal 
              information to other members and visitors, which allows our users 
              to identify each other and expand their network of friends.
MySpace 
              members can change their profile information at any time and can 
              control how other members and the service communicates with them.
==========
MySpace.com 
              cares deeply about online privacy.
If you have any questions concerning 
              this privacy policy, please email us at privacy@myspace.com 
Information 
              Collection and Use by MySpace.com

              MySpace.com collects user submitted information such as name, email 
              address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications 
              to those users relating to the MySpace.com service.
MySpace.com 
              also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal 
              interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist 
              users in finding and communicating with each other.
MySpace.com 
              also logs non-personally-identifiable information, such as IP address 
              and browser type, from all users and visitors to the site.
This 
              data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the 
              website services.
==========
User IP addresses are recorded for security and 
              monitoring purposes.
User 
              Profile information including members' pictures and first names 
              are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction 
              in the MySpace.com social networking community.
Email addresses 
              are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join MySpace, 
              to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications 
              related to the service.
With the exception of inviting friends, 
              adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not 
              shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network.
Users within a personal network communicate on MySpace.com with 
              each other through the MySpace.com service, without disclosing their 
              email addresses.
Users' full names are never directly revealed to 
              other members.
==========
To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances 
              on the service, MySpace.com allows users to search for other members 
              using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies 
              where users may have attended or worked.
We 
              may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter 
              or news regarding the service.
Users may choose not to receive email 
              of this type by changing their "notification" setting to "Do not 
              send me notification emails" in the user "Account Settings".
From 
              time to time, MySpace.com or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, 
              sweepstake or contest on myspace.com.
Users may be asked to provide 
              personal information including name, email address or home address 
              or to answer questions in order to participate.
We may transfer 
              personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly 
              requested to receive information from.
It will be clear at the point 
              of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose 
              privacy statement will apply.
==========
Invitations 
              and Other Communications to Non-members 
              MySpace members can invite friends to join the service by sending 
              invitation emails via our automated invitation system.
MySpace.com 
              stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents 
              may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, 
              and also to send reminders of the invitations.
MySpace.com does 
              not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication 
              besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email 
              address).
Recipients of invitations from MySpace.com may contact 
              MySpace.com to request the removal of their information from our 
              database.
MySpace 
              members may also store email addresses of people they know in their 
              internal MySpace address book and may also choose to send invitations 
              and other communications to those addresses.
You 
              may prevent MySpace.com email invitations and other messages from 
              being sent to any email address you control by sending a single 
              email with the subject "BLOCK" to privacy@myspace.com 
              Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to 
              block.

              network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will 
              be of most interest to you.

              of cookies by MySpace.com and does not cover the use of cookies

              MySpace.com member accounts are secured by member-created passwords.
MySpace.com takes precautions to insure that member account information 
              is kept private.
==========
We use reasonable measures to protect member information 
              that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member 
              information to those employees who need access to perform their 
              job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical 
              staff.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member 
              account information.
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software 
              failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member
