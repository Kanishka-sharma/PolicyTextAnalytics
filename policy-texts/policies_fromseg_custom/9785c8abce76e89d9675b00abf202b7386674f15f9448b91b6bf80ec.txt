About our terms of service
Welcome to Stripe.
We developed this payment service (the “Service”) to make it easy for you to accept credit and debit card payments online from your customers so you can focus on your own product or service.
We have tried to draft these Merchant Terms of Service to be readable to people like us.
==========
Unfortunately, the realities of the legal world make it a very difficult task.
So, should you have any questions or concerns or would simply like to better understand how we do things at Stripe, please do not hesitate to contact us.
==========
Below is a quick description of the sections in this Agreement, but (*legal disclaimer coming*) you should read each section to understand all the detailed terms of the agreement.
The Stripe Service
We provide you with software and a service to process your online credit and debit card payments; we will respect and protect your privacy and data.
You run your business, service your customers, protect your customers’ data, report & pay taxes, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations.
Getting a Stripe Service Account
You provide us with basic information about your company; we will seek to verify your information (we may work with third parties to do so) and approve your service account unless deemed risky (by us or our payment processors).
==========
You give us permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information or we otherwise must decline to offer you the service.
Receiving your Funds from Card Transactions
We pay you for your transactions (minus our fees), at a schedule communicated to you once your service account is approved.
(Payouts for your card transactions are typically sent to your bank within 7 days).
A certain amount of your funds may be subject to an additional hold period (e.g. Reserve Account) with terms determined by your perceived risk and transaction history.
You are responsible for refunds, returns, and liable for customer disputes (chargebacks).
==========
Termination and Other Legal Terms
We can terminate this agreement at any time (especially if you do something bad).
You can also terminate anytime.
Termination is effective immediately.
Termination does not alter your liability for processed payments or related chargebacks.
This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment).
==========

You agree that you will obtain an authorization from the Card Network(s) for each card transaction, as required under the Card Networks’ rules, and will not submit a card transaction for settlement where there is a negative authorization or the card is otherwise expired.
You acknowledge that the existence of an affirmative authorization from us or the Card Networks does not mean that a particular card transaction will not be subject to Chargeback, Reversal or Claim at a later date.
You will not impose any fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use an eligible payment card.
You will provide a receipt to the customer at the conclusion of the purchase transaction that includes all information required under Card Network rules and applicable law.

2.
==========
Payouts and Transaction History
We will pay out funds settling from the Card Networks to your designated bank settlement account in the amounts actually received (less our Fees as defined below) for card transactions submitted to our Service.
The payouts will be made to the bank account (“Bank Account”) you provide for your Stripe Service Account.
The Bank Account must be an account located at bank in the United States and held in the name of the business.
You are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding your Bank Account.
==========
Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to your Bank Account until the transaction is deemed complete.
Transactions will be deemed complete when we have received funds settling from the Card Networks and when we or our processing financial institutions have accepted such funds.
The actual timing of the transfers to your Bank Account of the settling funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule as defined below.
==========
After each payout of card settlement funds to your Bank Account, we will update information in your Stripe Service Account to reflect settlement.
Information regarding your card transactions processed and settled with the Services (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe Service Account.
We provide a minimum of one year of Transaction History on our website.
Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Stripe Service Account, your Transaction History and your use of the Service.
3.
==========
Payout Schedule
Payout schedule refers to the time it takes for us to initiate a transfer to your Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through the Service (“Payout Schedule”).
Once your bank account information has been reviewed, Stripe will initiate transfer of settlement funds (net Fees, chargebacks, and other funds owed to us for any reason) in accordance with the Payout Schedule, the terms of which will be made available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe Service Account.
The settlement funds should normally be credited to your Bank Account within 1-2 days of us initiating the payout.
We are not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding your Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to your Bank Account or not being made available to you in your Bank Account.
==========
You can contact Stripe to inquire about changing the timing of your Payout Schedule.
Upon submitting a request, you will be informed of the process and requirements for Stripe to review your Payout Schedule.
Stripe and/or Wells Fargo reserves the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to your Bank Account should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with your use of the Service or if required by law or court order.
4.
==========
Reconciliations and Errors
Your Transaction History will be available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe Service Account.
Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for reconciling your Transaction History with your actual card payment transactions.
==========
You agree to notify us of any discrepancies arising from such reconciliation and verification.
We will investigate any reported discrepancies and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover.
In the event you are owed money as a result of the discrepancy, we will transfer funds to your Bank Account in the next scheduled payout.
==========
Your failure to notify us of a error or discrepancy in your Transaction History within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you in connection with any such error or discrepancy in processing your card payments.
If you submit or cause us to process transactions erroneously, you agree to contact us immediately.
We will investigate any reported errors and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover by crediting or debiting your Stripe Service Account as appropriate.
Stripe will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error.
Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.
5.
==========
Refunds and Returns
By accepting these terms of service, you agree to submit any and all refunds and adjustments for returns of your products and services through the Stripe Service to the cardholders card in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Network Rules.
Network Rules require that you will (i) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (ii) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase, (iii) not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and (iv) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund.
==========
Full refunds must be for the exact dollar amount of the original transaction including tax, handling charges, and other.
The refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to customer for postage costs incurred for product returns.
==========
Refunds processed though the Stripe Service must be submitted within sixty (60) days of the original transaction but in all cases, within three (3) days of approving the Cardholder refund.
For processed refunds, Stripe will deduct the refund amount (including any applicable Fees) from (i) settlement funds owed to you from processing of other card transactions, or (ii) funds in any Reserve Account.
If these funds are not sufficient, you authorize Stripe to initiate an ACH debit entry to your Bank Account in the amount necessary to complete the refund transaction to the Cardholder’s card.
In the event Stripe cannot access your Bank Account by means of ACH debit entry, you agree to pay all funds owed to Stripe upon demand.
You are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services; Stripe has no responsibility or obligation for processing such returns.
==========
6.
Chargebacks
A Chargeback (defined below in Section D(6)) is typically caused when a customer disputes a charge that appears on their bill.
A Chargeback may result in the reversal of a transaction, with the amount charged back to you.
==========
You can be assessed charge backs for: (i) customer disputes, or (ii) unauthorized or improperly authorized transactions, or (iii) transactions that do not comply with Network Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious, or (iv) any reversals for any reason by the Network, our processor or acquiring bank, or the Cardholder bank.
When a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable to Stripe for the full amount of payment of the Chargeback plus any associated Fees, fines, expenses or penalties (including those assessed by the Networks or our payment processors).
You agree that Stripe may recover these amounts by debiting by means of ACH debit of your Bank Account associated with your Stripe Service Account, debiting your Reserve Account, or setting off any amounts owed to you by us.
If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand.
You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of any unpaid Chargebacks unpaid by you.
Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.
7.
==========
Contesting your Chargebacks
You or Stripe may elect to contest Chargebacks assessed to your account.
Stripe may provide you with assistance including notifications and software to help contest your Chargebacks.
We do not assume any liability for our role or assistance in contesting Chargebacks.
You agree to provide us with the necessary information, in a timely manner and at your expense, to investigate or help resolve any Chargeback.
==========
You also grant us permission to share records or other information required with the Cardholder, the Cardholder’s financial institution, and your financial institution to help resolve any disputes.
You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result in an irreversible Chargeback being assessed.
==========
If the Cardholder’s issuing bank or the Network does not resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees from you as described in this Agreement.
We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating or investigating Chargeback disputes.
8.
==========
Excessive Chargebacks
At any point, Stripe, Wells Fargo, the Card Networks, or our payment processor(s) may determine that you are incurring excessive Chargebacks.
Excessive Chargebacks may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines.
Excessive Chargebacks may also result in additional controls and restrictions to your use of the Stripe Service, including without limitation, (i) changes to the terms of your Reserve Account, (ii) increases to your applicable Fees, (iii) delays in your Payout Schedule, or (iv) possible suspension or termination of your Stripe Service Account and the Service.
The Networks may also place additional controls or restrictions as part of their own monitoring programs for merchants with excessive Chargebacks.
9.
==========
Stripe Fees
You agree to pay the Fees (“Fees”) assessed by us to you for providing the payment services described in this Agreement.
These fees will be calculated pursuant to the Fee Schedule linked to here and incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
We reserve the right to revise our Fees at any time, subject to a thirty (30) day notice period to you.
You acknowledge that you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed on Stripe or directly to you by any Network or financial institution as a result of your activities.
10.
==========
Our Collection Rights
To the extent permitted by law, we may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by deducting the corresponding amounts from the Reserve Account or from funds payable to you arising from the settlement of card transactions.
Fees will be assessed at the time a transaction is processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for such transactions.
If the settlement amounts or Reserve Account are not sufficient to meet your obligations to us, we may charge or debit the bank account or credit card registered in your Stripe Service Account for any amounts owed to us.
==========
Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of this Agreement.
You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.
Additionally, we may require a personal guaranty from a principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement.
11.
==========
Reserves
Funds in held in reserves are amounts of money set aside to cover Chargebacks, refunds, or other payment obligations under this agreement (a “Reserve Account”).
Stripe, in its sole discretion, will set the terms of your Reserve Account and notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for your transaction is held for a period of time or that additional amounts are held in Reserve Account.
Stripe, in its sole discretion, may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any time for any reason based on your payment processing history or as requested by our payment processors.
Stripe may fund the Reserve Account by means of: (i) any funds payouts made or due to you for card transactions submitted to the service, or, or (ii) amounts available in your Bank Account by means of ACH debit to that Bank Account, or (iv) other sources of funds associated with your Stripe Service Account; or (iv) requesting that you provide funds to Stripe for deposit to the Reserve Account.
12.
Security Interest
You grant us a lien and security interest in the Reserve Account, all Card transactions (including future Card transactions), any rights to receive credits or payments under this Agreement, and all deposits and other property of yours possessed or maintained by us on your behalf.
You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.
