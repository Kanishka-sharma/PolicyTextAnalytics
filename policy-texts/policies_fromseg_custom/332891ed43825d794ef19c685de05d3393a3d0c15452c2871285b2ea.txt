Data Collection through Zillian Services
What does Zillian do?
Through our services, our customers – advertisers, advertising agencies, publishers, and other users of Zillian services – may collect and use information about your device to provide you with a more tailored online advertising experience.
==========
Our customers use Zillian’s tools and services (e.g. Flexserve) to create and deliver advertisements (also referred to as ad serving), to monitor the success of and manage advertising campaigns, to detect and minimize advertising fraud and, ultimately, to present you with advertisements that are more likely to be interesting and relevant to you.
When providing these services to our customers, Zillian can act as a data processor for these customers.
This means that the customers are responsible for the processing of personal data relating to you, while Zillian processes such data based on the customer’s instructions.
How does Zillian deliver advertising on behalf of our customers?
Zillian’s technologies are deployed on your devices, and through the third-party website and mobile applications you use.
==========
The information we collect is associated with your identifiers and/or mobile advertising identifiers (if you are using a mobile device), as well as your IP address.
We never collect information about your actual identity.
As explained above, our technology employs device identifiers and similar technologies (like statistical device identifiers) to collect information about your browser or device, the sites it has visited, the advertisements served to it, interactions with those advertisements, and, where available, the approximate geographic location of the device (“ad serving information”).
We use the ad serving information we collect to deliver an advertisement to you from a company who engages our services and to measure engagement with such advertisement.
This information is collected in the course of providing our customers with ad-serving and campaign management services and is used for the purpose of helping our customers determine which advertisement is suitable to be delivered to you.
This ad serving information, which does not enable Zillian to determine your actual identity, may be shared with our customers and Zillian’s and our customers’ partners for our customers’ advertising purposes.
==========
We use reasonable efforts to require our customers and partners to treat the information we share with them in accordance with applicable laws, the terms of the contracts we may have with them, and their own privacy policies.
Cross-device advertising
We use the term “device” or “devices” to refer collectively to computers and mobile devices, as well as the internet browsers and other applications on your devices that interact with the internet.
Zillian may engage in cross-device data collection, which refers to the process of collecting data from separate devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related, on behalf of customers.
Zillian, or partners that we employ to provide this service, use cross-device data to provide advertising services to our customers and to deliver tailored ads to users across multiple devices.
Information Collected by Customers and their Partners
Please note that Zillian’s customers sometimes include their own (or their partners’) ad-tags, pixels or similar technologies within advertisements that Zillian could serve to Website for those customers.
==========
Zillian does not control such collection or processing and we use reasonable efforts to require customers to treat such information in accordance with applicable laws and their own privacy policies.
In addition, if you visit a website or mobile application that uses Zillian services, or click through an ad to the website or online service of one of our customers, those customers may collect additional information about your visit beyond the information described in this privacy policy.
==========
They may also allow other companies (such as other ad networks or web analytics services) to collect information through mechanisms such as cookies, pixels and similar technologies.
Zillian is not responsible for and cannot control the data collection and use practices of its customers or their partners.
You should read the privacy notices of the website you visit and the online services and interactive ads that you use to understand what information companies collect and how they use that information.
On occasion, at the request and on behalf of a customer, Zillian  may collect personal information supplied voluntarily by consumers through their interaction with data collection fields in the body of advertisements or on website (such as name, email, etc.).
This personal information is provided directly to the customer on whose behalf the information was collected, or the customer’s service providers, and is processed by Zillian only to the extent and as long as is necessary to provide the advertising services for which the personal information was collected.
==========
Zillian is not responsible for its customers’ use of this voluntarily supplied data.
Zillian does not distribute this personal information to any party other than those indicated within the advertisement or, at the customers’ direction, their service providers.
Zillian never associates any of this personal information with any other data (such as ad serving information) gathered or used in the delivery of advertisements.
Links to Other Sites
Our site and the advertisements we serve on behalf of customers may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours.
In addition, there may be links to other sites provided within the body of advertisements on other website.
We do not have control over the information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
==========
You should consult the privacy policy of these other sites to learn how your privacy is protected.
Privacy Practices for Advertising and Content Served by Zillian
We respect your right to privacy throughout all of the services we provide.
==========
We also subscribe to the policies of the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework, as a registered vendor on the Global Vendor List.

==========
Data Security and Retention
We have appropriate technical and organizational security measures in place to help protect the personal information that is submitted to us voluntarily through our web site or collected through interactions with our services.
However, no system can be completely secure, and we make no guarantees as to the safety or security of any information transmitted to or from this site or through our services.
==========
Zillian retains information we receive from your device in log files for up to 13 months from the time it is stored, after which time the information is deleted.
Our Use of Advertising Technologies
This section provides additional information about the various technologies that Zillian uses to manage Zillian Website and to deliver ads to you and services to our customers, including services that collect ad serving information when you interact with our customers’ ads or the sites and applications where their ads are provided.
Cookies
We use cookies to provide functionality to Zillian Website and also to deliver our advertising services to our customers.
A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on your computer or device when you view an advertisement or website relating to one of our customers.
==========
The cookie does not contain your name, address, phone number, email address, or anything that enables us to determine your actual identity.
Instead, Zillian uses cookies to collect information such as a computer’s IP address, the type of the computer’s operating system, the type of internet browser software, what web pages were viewed and at what time.
A common use of cookies is to determine if a particular ad has already been served to a specific device and to cap the frequency at which that ad is presented to the same device.
==========
Mobile Advertising Identifiers
Most mobile devices include an identifier that allows application publishers and marketers to track user activity on mobile devices for advertising purposes (for example, Google’s Android Advertising Identifier (AAID) and Apple’s Identifier for Advertising (IDFA)).
Zillian could use mobile advertising identifiers for the same purposes for which we use statistical identifiers.
Log files
Like most Website and advertising services providers, we gather certain information when you visit or interact with Zillian Website and on our customers’ behalf when you encounter our customers’ ads and Website.
This information is collected automatically and stored in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
==========
This information, which does not allow us to determine your actual identity, is used for purposes such as administering the site and the services, analyzing trends, and measuring user engagement with content.
Pixels (also known as Clear Gifs)
On behalf of our customers, we may employ advertising pixels (a.k.a. clear gifs) on Website and advertisements that interact with some of our services.
Pixels help our customers better manage content and advertising on Website by informing as to what content is effective.
==========
Pixels are graphics embedded invisibly in web and advertising content and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Pixels work with cookies to record the interactions of users with Website and advertisements.
Statistical Identifiers and Cross-Device
Like pixels, statistical identifiers help to better manage content and advertising on devices by informing (without using cookies) as to the content with which users interact.
Statistical identifiers collect various information about a device, such as screen resolution, browser type, or operating system.
Devices may have unique, or near unique, device profiles and so collecting this information helps to determine to a reasonable level of statistical accuracy the level of users’ engagement with our website or our customers’ advertisements and Website and to recognize the devices of users who interact with our or our customers’ content.
The information gathered through the use of statistical identifiers is not associated with any information that would enable us to determine an individual’s actual identity.
==========
Our customers use Zillian’s cross-device solutions to tailor advertising experience across all devices, such as a computer, mobile phone and tablet.
For example, using cross-device solutions, advertisers can limit the number of times you see the same ad on multiple devices, or serve you a follow-up ad on your computer after you have seen a related ad on your mobile device.
==========
Information Relating to Children
Our products and services are not designed or intended for children (as defined in applicable data protection laws).
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children on our website or through our services.
Please advise us if you are aware of our having received personal information from a child, in which case we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
For these purposes, “children” and “child” refer to ages defined by applicable law in the countries where we provide our services.
International Data Transfers and Privacy Shield Compliance
The personal information Zillian processes may be transferred to, and processed in, any country in which we, our group companies, or our service providers or partners operate, and this may include countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
==========
