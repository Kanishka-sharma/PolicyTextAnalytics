liquify is a rarity; one of the few who give and never ask for anything in return; one of the few who does it all out of love for our community.
She is one of the cornerstones of this site, one of the few truly devious members upon whom we depend.
This month we are pleased to be able to offer our thanks, and to try and give something back to someone who has given so much.
