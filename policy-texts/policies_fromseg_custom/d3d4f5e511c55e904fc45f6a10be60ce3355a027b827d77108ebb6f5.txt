View summary of recent updates Return to Terms of Service
Below is a high level summary of the recent material changes we've made to our Terms of Service, but please be sure to read the Terms of Service in its entirety as that constitutes the binding agreement governing your use of the Services:
January 4, 2012
As we expand across the globe and create new Eventbrite domains, we wanted to clarify that the websites we are referring to in Section 1.1(a) of the Terms of Service includes all Eventbrite websites and domains.
As we expand our product offerings to mobile apps such as At The Doorâ„¢, Entry Manager and the Eventbrite app, we wanted to clarify in Section 3.2 of the Terms of Service that these new offerings are a part of our Services.
We added a description to Section 4.4(c) of the required reporting that the IRS is mandating under the new 1099-K regulations.
We have clarified in Section 6 of the Terms of Service that Eventbrite is the sole and final arbiter of account ownership disputes.
==========
Many of our customers have expressed their desire to use our Services to run raffles, contests and sweepstakes in compliance with applicable laws.
So we have removed our flat prohibition on raffles, contests and sweepstakes in Section 7.2 and Section 8.1 of the Terms of Service and replaced it with required guidelines, which if followed, will allow a customer organizing a raffle, contest or sweepstakes on our Services to do so.
We updated the address and contact information of our DMCA agent in Section 7.3 of the Terms of Service.
February 1, 2012
We added a new Section 1.3 that covers translations to our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and other documents on the Eventbrite Site.
March 28, 2012
We clarified the terms of our Organizer Referral Program in Section 10.1 of our Terms of Service Agreement (Organizers) and Section 9.1 of our Terms of Service Agreement (Buyers and Other Non-Organizers).
We've clarified in Section 8.1 that we no longer allow Content relating to the sale or provision of goods and services unrelated to events listed on the Eventbrite Site.
July 25, 2012
Eventbrite can now be used for more than just selling tickets and registrations!
We now give our Organizers the ability to sell merchandise in connection with their tickets and registrations.
==========
So we have broadened some of the language throughout the Terms of Service to cover the sale of merchandise.
We've changed our fee language throughout the Site to make it more consistent and clear.
This required certain changes throughout the Terms of Service.
We've removed language with respect to bank account transfers as a permissible means of payment.
Eventbrite hopes to offer direct debit payment options in the future, but for now we found this language to be confusing to our customers.
==========
We've streamlined the content licenses in Section 7.1 and 7.2 of the Terms of Service to make them clearer and less repetitive.
December 18, 2012
We've updated Section 4.4(c) of the Organizer TOS due to new IRS regulations.
You can learn more about these new regulations and how they affect your Eventbrite account here.
http://help.eventbrite.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/647317 Specifically, the new regulations require us to withhold a certain portion of your funds and remit them to the IRS if we do not receive certain tax information from you before we pay you for more than 200 order transactions in calendar year 2013.
We'll be in touch for this information, but if you would like to proactively enter it you can do so here.
http://www.eventbrite.com/tax_information/forms/
We've also updated our language in Section 4.4(c) to further clarify who is obligated with respect to certain taxes and that our invoices and billing statements do not generally include taxes.
==========
October 8, 2013
We've made some important updates to our Eventbrite Terms of Service Agreement (Organizers) (the "Organizer TOS") and Eventbrite Terms of Service Agreement (Buyers and Other Non-Organizers) (the "Buyer TOS").
If you are an Eventbrite Organizer, we've also sent you an email summarizing these changes.
We strive not to act unilaterally and without good reason, so some of our updates try to clarify why and on what basis we might take certain actions, including:
Our policies and procedures with respect to modifying the Organizer TOS and the Buyer TOS (Section 1.2);
Our policies with respect to refunds (Section 4.3(b) of the Organizer TOS and Section 4.2 of the Buyer TOS);
Organizers' responsibilities for chargebacks (Section 4.3 of the Organizer TOS);
Our rights to any feedback you provide about the Services and any modifications we make to the Services related to your feedback (Section 7.3);
Our rights to monitor, alter, edit, remove and preserve Your Content and account information (Section 8.2);
Our rights to terminate your use of a sub domain (Section 9 of the Organizer TOS);
Our rights to consent prior to your settlement of any Claims (Section 13 of the Organizer TOS and Section 11 of the Buyer TOS);
Our rights to change our features and parts of the Services (Section 14 of the Organizer TOS and Section 12 of the Buyer TOS);
Our rights to terminate your use of the Services (Section 15 of the Organizer TOS and Section 13 of the Buyer TOS); and
Our rights to assign the Terms of Service and your rights to assign the Terms of Service (Section 23.8 of the Organizer TOS and Section 21.8 of the Buyer TOS).
As we expand our product offerings to include the ability to contribute to fundraising campaigns and to transfer tickets/registrations, we made updates throughout the Terms of Service to reflect these new features.
We clarified what our service fees are based on and who determines the service fees that are passed along to Buyers (Section 4.3 of the Buyer TOS).
We specified Organizers' appointment of Eventbrite as a limited agent to collect payments made by Buyers on behalf of Organizers (Section 4.5 of the Organizer TOS and Section 4.4 of the Buyer TOS).
==========
We wanted to clarify that you own the content you post to the Eventbrite Services and we have only a limited license to use it (Section 7.2).
We wanted to clarify our policies on Content belonging to or originating from third parties (Section 7.4).
We wanted to clarify our policies on certain actions that you should not be taking on our Services, including reselling tickets and collecting sensitive financial and personal data (other than credit card numbers under "Credit Card" on the order payment page) (Section 8.1).
==========
We have revised our limits on liability to be based on the level of your activities on the services (i.e., the Eventbrite Service Fees you pay) rather than on an arbitrary number (Section 18 of the Organizer TOS and Section 16 of the Buyer TOS).
The most important change is the addition of a binding arbitration agreement as new Section 21.3 of the Buyer TOS and Section 23.3 of the Organizer TOS.
While we think it is very unlikely for us to have a dispute that our customer support team cannot resolve, if there ever is such a dispute we believe that binding arbitration, on balance, will benefit both Buyers and Organizers.
==========
Arbitration is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court.
In case of smaller claims ($10,000 or less), Eventbrite will even let you decide whether there is a hearing and in some cases Eventbrite will even pay the costs and expenses of the arbitrator.
We think that, on balance, these provisions will give you an effective method for resolving your claims in the unlikely event we ever have a dispute.
Because we feel that arbitration is not a suitable place to have class, consolidated or representative claims heard, as part of the binding arbitration agreement, you and Eventbrite are agreeing to bring claims against the other in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, consolidated or representative proceeding.
==========
We realize that this is an important change.
Because of that, we are providing you with a period to opt-out of this particular change.
To opt-out some or all of your registered accounts, please send us a written notice by November 30, 2013 to Eventbrite, Inc., 651 Brannan Street, Suite 110, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA, Attn: Corporate Counsel, which (i) states you do not agree to this agreement to arbitrate, (ii) includes your name and all email addresses associated with the registered accounts you wish to opt-out, and (iii) is signed by the individual who owns the account, or in the event the account is held by an entity, an authorized signer for such entity (the "Opt-Out Notice").
The Opt-Out Notice must be received by November 30, 2013 in order to be effective; otherwise the agreement to arbitrate will be effective as of October 8, 2013.
Please note that new accounts registered after today and use of the Services and activities on the Services (other than by registered users under registered accounts that have been opted-out) after October 8, 2013 will be subject to this agreement to arbitrate without any opt-out option.
In connection with the arbitration agreement, we have also updated our judicial forum clause (Section 23.5 of the Organizer TOS and Section 21.5 of the Buyer TOS) which calls for any dispute or claim not subject to arbitration (i.e., in case of opt-out in the manner described above) to be resolved exclusively by a federal court located in San Francisco County, California, and to the extent there is no subject matter jurisdiction in such federal court, then a state court in San Francisco County, California.

PAYMENT METHODS.
==========
4.1 Overview.
There are two types of payment processing options Organizers may elect when using the Services: (a) "Facilitated Payment Processing" or "FPP", which consists of collecting Event Registration Fees using FPMs; and (b) "Credit Card Processing" or "CCP", which requires the use of the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees.
Depending on the payment processing option the Organizer elects when using the Services, monetary payments will be made to the Organizer directly by Buyers (via FPP) or by Eventbrite (via CCP), in each case as described below.
4.2 Facilitated Payment Processing.
==========
(a) Independent Relationship.
When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.
(b) Services Fees.
Organizers will collect all monies directly from Buyers under the FPP option.
By registering for and using the FPP option, you agree (i) to pay Eventbrite all then-applicable service fees and Credit Card Processing fees, which are based on the number and/or the value of your transactions, and which charges are described in greater detail at http://www.eventbrite.com/fees, and all additional on-site service fees, equipment lease charges, printed ticket fees, fees on incremental price increases for transferred tickets, and any other fees and charges of any kind payable by you to Eventbrite in connection with the provision of the Services (collectively, "Service Fees"), which payments shall be due and payable within fifteen (15) days of delivery of the invoice setting forth such charges; and (ii) to accept the responsibility for providing refunds to Buyers.
We will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Eventbrite and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the FPP option.
==========
Invoices are sent monthly for Service Fees incurred in the previous month
4.3 Credit Card Processing.
(a) Gateway; Payment Process.
When an Organizer elects to use the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees, payment processing occurs directly through Eventbrite.
Under the CCP option, we will collect all Event Registration Fees on behalf of Organizer from Buyers and deduct all applicable Services Fees from the Event Registration Fees we collect, and then pass the remainder along to Organizer within five (5) business days after the end date for the event or fundraising campaign to which the Event Registration Fees correspond (either by mailing a check or through an electronic funds transfer, depending on the option Organizer has chosen through using the Services, to the address or account, respectively, that Organizer accurately designates on the Services), provided that Eventbrite reserves the right to withhold funds (i) at any time as we determine to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, and other discrepancies and (ii) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this TOS.
Eventbrite, in its sole discretion, may determine to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Organizer prior to the period set forth above, on such terms and conditions as we may establish from time to time.
Organizer agrees that all Event Registration Fees are earned by Organizer only following conclusion of the applicable event and all Event Registration Fees ultimately due will be net of all Service Fees, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and other deductions, whether due to customer complaints, allegations of fraud, discrepancies related to the applicable event or otherwise.
==========
No payments shall be made to Organizer from Eventbrite with respect to any event that is cancelled.
If payments have already been made by Eventbrite to Organizer for a cancelled event, Organizer will immediately refund to Eventbrite all such payments upon our request.
All Event Registration Fees are payable in U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies accepted by Eventbrite.
If Organizer elects to list Event Registration Fees in a foreign currency accepted by Eventbrite, we will collect and disperse the funds in such foreign currency, provided that Event Registration Fees can only be deposited in a bank account in the country whose foreign currency is selected.
Eventbrite will not convert currencies for Organizer.
ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ANY PAYMENT BY EVENTBRITE OF EVENT REGISTRATION FEES PRIOR TO THE FIFTH (5TH) BUSINESS DAY AFTER THE END DATE OF THE APPLICABLE EVENT ARE MERELY ADVANCES OF AMOUNTS THAT MAY BECOME DUE TO ORGANIZER UNDER THIS TOS AND THAT Eventbrite MAY DEMAND SUCH ADVANCES BACK (FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION), AND ORGANIZER SHALL THEREUPON PROMPTLY (AND IN ANY CASE WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER SUCH DEMAND) PAY BACK TO Eventbrite SUCH ADVANCE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF DEMANDED BY EVENTBRITE.
==========
(b) Refunds.
Under the CCP option, Organizer must communicate its refund policy to Buyers and issue refunds to Buyers in accordance with such policy.
Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this TOS, the payment and refund mechanics of the Services and all applicable laws.
==========
The Services permit Organizer to issue refunds to Buyers only within certain windows permitted by our payment processor(s) and payment gateway(s).
If Organizer wishes to make a refund following any such window it will not be processed through the Services (but may be processed manually by Organizer), unless otherwise agreed to by Eventbrite.
All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between Organizer and its Buyers, and Eventbrite will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify and reimburse Eventbrite and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the CCP option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Eventbrite shall have the right to force a refund of specific orders or all orders (as determined by Eventbrite) at any time if Eventbrite believes it is likely to receive complaints, refund requests and/or chargebacks with respect to the specific orders or from a substantial number (as determined by Eventbrite in its sole discretion) of Buyers with respect to the applicable event or another event held by Organizer, or Eventbrite determines in its sole discretion that the order is fraudulent or the Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations.
Further, if one or more Buyers request a refund, whether due to a cancelled event or for any other reason where Eventbrite would reasonably expect to lose a chargeback, Eventbrite may, in its sole discretion, issue such refund to such Buyer(s), and Organizer shall then owe the amount of such refund to Eventbrite.
==========
(c) Credit Card Chargebacks.
Under the CCP option, any credit card chargebacks initiated by a Buyer for any reason with respect to an event shall be charged back to Organizer.
All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between Organizer and the applicable Buyers, and Eventbrite will not be responsible or liable in any way for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify and reimburse Eventbrite and its affiliates for, chargebacks incurred by Eventbrite that relate to Organizer's use of the CCP option.
==========
4.4 Non-Exclusive Remedies.
(a) Payment.
In the event that Organizer fails to pay to Eventbrite any amount owed pursuant to this TOS when due, such amount shall bear interest calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) per annum, and (ii) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.
In the event any amounts are owed by Organizer to Eventbrite under this TOS or otherwise, Eventbrite may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, (i) deduct such amounts from Organizer's outstanding balance, whether for that particular event or for any other event that Organizer lists through the Services; and/or (ii) send an invoice to Organizer for such amounts to the extent Organizer's outstanding balance is insufficient to cover these costs, in which case Organizer shall pay Eventbrite such invoiced amounts within fifteen (15) days after the date of the invoice.
If payment for any amounts due to Eventbrite hereunder is not made by Organizer when due, Eventbrite reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, to terminate Organizer's registration for the Services (including any and all accounts that Organizer may have) and to cancel all events listed by Organizer.
==========
(b) Confirmation.
Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual ticket purchase, Eventbrite generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number.
You agree to unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all ticketing commitments that have been confirmed by Eventbrite through the Services, and it is your responsibility to verify the Buyer's membership status, confirmation number and/or any event restrictions prior to the subject event.
==========
(c) Taxes; Withholding.
(i) You are solely responsible for determining which, if any, sales, use, amusement, value added, consumption, excise and other taxes, duties, levies and charges (collectively, "Taxes") apply to your use of the Services and for collecting, remitting and reporting the correct amounts of all such Taxes to the applicable governmental authorities, even if Eventbrite provides you with tools that assist you in doing so.
Eventbrite does not represent or warrant that any tax tools will meet all tax requirements that may be applicable to you.
Eventbrite cannot give you legal or tax advice, so please be sure to check with your own tax advisor about any applicable Taxes.
In the event that a governmental authority requires Eventbrite to pay any Taxes attributable to your use of the Services, you agree to indemnify and reimburse Eventbrite for such Taxes and all costs and expenses related thereto.
(ii) All Service Fees charged by Eventbrite do not include any Taxes except to the extent that a Tax is expressly set forth in the applicable invoice or billing statement, and you agree to pay any Taxes that are imposed and payable on such Service Fees (other than those calculated based on Eventbrite's net income) to Eventbrite.
(iii) In addition, due to new IRS regulations, if Eventbrite processes transactions and issues you payouts (A) for more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in gross sales and (B) for more than two hundred (200) order transactions, in each case during a given calendar year and in the aggregate across all of your accounts, Eventbrite is required to report to the IRS the gross amount of transactions for which you have been paid in that calendar year and in each month of that calendar year, as well as, your name, your address, and your Tax Identification Number ("Your Tax Information").
Starting in 2013, as part of these new IRS regulations, Eventbrite is required to either (A) collect Your Tax Information or (B) establish that you are a foreign person not subject to US taxes, before your accounts pass the two hundred (200) order transaction threshold in the aggregate.
Once your accounts cross the two hundred (200) order transaction threshold, you agree that you will not receive any further payments from Eventbrite until either (A) or (B) above are satisfied.
==========
To learn more about these new IRS regulations and why we are required to do this, see our 1099-K FAQ: http://help.eventbrite.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/647317
(iv) Eventbrite reserves the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to you hereunder if Eventbrite suspects or determines that such amounts have been generated in (A) a fraudulent manner, (B) violation of this TOS, or (C) violation of any applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic), or if Eventbrite is required to do so by applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic).
Such withholding may be temporary or permanent (as determined by Eventbrite).
4.5 Appointment of Eventbrite as Payment Agent for Organizer.
==========
When using CCP, Organizer hereby appoints Eventbrite as the Organizer's limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Buyers on behalf of Organizer to an event and/or related fundraising campaign posted on the Services.
Organizer agrees that a payment made by Buyer to Eventbrite shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to Organizer and Organizer will sell or provide all goods and services to Buyer in the agreed upon manner as if Organizer has directly received the Event Registration Fees from such Buyer, regardless of whether payment has yet to be received from Eventbrite.
Organizer agrees that Eventbrite may (i) enable Buyer to transfer a ticket/registration (if permitted by Organizer during the event registration process) and (ii) issue refunds to Buyer as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of this TOS.
In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of Organizer, Eventbrite assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of Organizer.
==========
4.6 Charitable Fundraising Pages and Donations.
Certain event registration pages on the Services may be fundraising pages linked to events.
If you are an Organizer of a fundraising page, you must use CCP with respect to such fundraising page.
Currently only Credit Card Processing fees apply with respect to bona fide donations made with respect to a fundraising page.
5.

The referral fee will be paid at the beginning of each month to the Organizer Referrer if the amount due and unpaid is five dollars ($5.00) or more.
Any unpaid balances will be added to any balances due in subsequent months.
(c) Eventbrite reserves the right to change, modify or terminate this Organizer referral program and/or its terms at any time in its sole discretion.

==========
GENERAL.
23.1 Entire Agreement.
This TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Eventbrite and governs your use of the Services as an Organizer, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, discussions or communications between you and Eventbrite on the subject matter hereof, other than any written Ticketing Services Agreement, Eventbrite Equipment Lease Agreement or Addendum Agreement between you and an authorized officer of Eventbrite relating to a specified event or events.
You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third party Content or third party software or the Services in a manner other than as governed by this TOS.
==========
23.2 Choice of Law.
Except as set forth in Section 23.3, this TOS and the provision of the Services to you are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California by California residents.
23.3 Arbitration.
BINDING ARBITRATION: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM UNDER THIS TOS OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (TO THE EXTENT THE CLAIM QUALIFIES) AND WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY; CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS AND CIVIL ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED ONCE THIS SECTION IS EFFECTIVE.
==========
(a) Contact Us First.
If you have a question or concern about the Services, please contact us first.
Our customer support team will try to answer your question or resolve your concern.
==========
(b) Agreement to Arbitrate.
In the unlikely event that our customer support team is unable to resolve your concerns, we each hereby agree to resolve any and all disputes or claims under this TOS or with respect to the Services through binding arbitration or in small claims court (to the extent the claim qualifies) instead of in courts of general jurisdiction and only on an individual basis and not as part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding.
Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief as a court.
Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review.
==========
Only the arbitrator appointed pursuant to this Section, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the authority to resolve any dispute or claim relating to this Section, including, without limitation, the scope, enforceability and arbitrability hereof.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this TOS.
This TOS evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 21.3 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section 21.2 above.
==========
(c) Scope of Agreement.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to:
all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
all claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
all claims that may arise after the termination of this TOS and/or your use of the Services.
(d) Exceptions.
Notwithstanding this Agreement to arbitrate, either party may (i) bring an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the extent the applicable claim qualifies), (ii) bring issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Trade Commission and the California Division of Consumer Services, which agencies may be able to seek relief on a party's behalf (the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210), and (iii) bring suit in court to seek a preliminary injunction or other interim relief pending the outcome of arbitration.
In addition, the portion of any dispute or complaint relating to our participation in the US-EU or US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks is subject to the Dispute Resolution section of our Privacy Policy before being subject to this Section.
==========
(e) No Class Actions.
YOU AND EVENTBRITE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTAIVE PROCEEDING AND MAY ONLY PROVIDE RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.
==========
(f) Notice of Dispute.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
The Notice to Eventbrite must be addressed to the address in Section 19 above ("Notice Address") and must be sent by certified mail.
The Notice to you must be addressed to a mailing, home, or payment address currently on record with Eventbrite and must be sent by certified mail.
If no such physical address exists, such notice may be delivered to your Eventbrite account email address.
==========
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If Eventbrite and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Eventbrite may commence an arbitration proceeding.
(g) Arbitration Proceedings.
==========
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (and in addition, if the actions giving rise to the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use), the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes) (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Section 21.3, and will be administered by the AAA and settled by a single arbitrator.
The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this TOS.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 21.3.
==========
Unless Eventbrite and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA shall determine the location.
If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
==========
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
All decisions by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
(h) Costs of Arbitration; Legal Fees.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if (i) you are initiating an arbitration against Eventbrite, (ii) the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, and (iii) you include in the Notice your election to have Eventbrite pay all filing, administration and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA, then Eventbrite will pay such costs and expenses (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then Eventbrite will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
In the event that the arbitrator determines that any of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Eventbrite for all such cost and expenses that Eventbrite paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.
==========
Just as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration hereunder.
Should either party be determined to have substantially prevailed in the arbitration, then upon such party's request, the arbitrator shall award such prevailing party the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses that it incurred in connection with the arbitration, provided that to the extent that the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use) Eventbrite will not seek to recover its attorneys' fees and expenses in an arbitration initiated by you, unless the arbitrator determines that one or more of your claims are frivolous.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement of attorneys' fees and expenses upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
==========
(i) Future Changes.
Notwithstanding any provision in this TOS to the contrary, you and Eventbrite agree that if Eventbrite makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) Eventbrite will provide you with written notice of such change to your account email address and you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as unmodified by such rejected change.
==========
(j) Special Severability.
In the event that the provisions of subsection (e) above are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any dispute or claim, then, notwithstanding Section 21.4, the entirety of this Section 21.3 shall be null and void with respect to such dispute or claim and Section 21.5 shall apply in lieu of this Section 21.3.
(k) Opt Out.
==========
We believe that on a whole this agreement to arbitrate will benefit our users.
However, if you are an existing registered user and you do not wish to accept this agreement to arbitrate with respect to some or all of your accounts registered prior to October 8, 2013, you may opt-out by sending us a written notice to the Notice Address which (i) states you do not agree to this agreement to arbitrate, (ii) includes your name and all email addresses associated with the accounts you wish to opt-out, and (iii) is signed by the individual who owns the account, or in the event the account is held by an entity, an authorized signer for such entity (the "Opt-Out Notice").
The Opt-Out Notice must be received by November 30, 2013 in order to be effective; otherwise this agreement to arbitrate will be effective as of October 8, 2013.
For new registered users and existing registered users who register new accounts following October 8, 2013, there is no option to opt-out and this provision will be effective as to such new accounts upon account creation.
In the event that you opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate as set forth above, Section 21.5 of this TOS shall apply in lieu of this Section 21.3.
==========
23.4 Waiver; Invalid Provisions.
The failure or delay of Eventbrite to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
No oral waiver, amendment or modification shall be effective under any circumstance whatsoever.
If any provision of this TOS is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this TOS shall remain in full force and effect.
==========
23.5 Judicial Forum.
In the event that Section 21.3 shall be null and void as set forth in Section 21.3(j) above or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate as set forth in Section 21.3(k), then any dispute or claim not subject to arbitration shall be resolved exclusively by a federal court located in San Francisco County, California, and to the extent there is no subject matter jurisdiction in such federal court, then a state court in San Francisco County, California.
Both you and Eventbrite agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and agree that such forum is convenient.
23.6 Titles.
The section titles in this TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not, and shall not permit anyone else to, directly or indirectly: (a) copy, modify, reproduce, translate, localize, port or otherwise create derivatives of any part of the Services or Site Content (as defined below); (b) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence and organization of all or any part of the Services (except that this restriction shall not apply to the limited extent restrictions on reverse engineering are prohibited by applicable local law); (c) rent, lease, resell, distribute, use the Services for timesharing, service bureau, or commercial purposes or otherwise exploit the Services in any unauthorized manner; (d) remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on or in the Services or Site Content; (e) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services; or (vi) engage in any fraudulent activity or activity that facilitates fraud.
Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
==========
3.2 Software.
(a) License.
If you are allowed to download or use any Software in connection with the Services, Eventbrite hereby grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-exclusive license to use the Software solely for your internal use in connection with the Services, and only in accordance with this TOS and the written instructions/directions (if any) provided by Eventbrite in conjunction with the Software.
For purposes of this TOS, "Software" shall mean any and all software that is available on or through the Site or otherwise provided by Eventbrite, including without limitation Eventbrite's mobile applications (such as At The DoorÂ®, Entry Manager and the Eventbrite app).
==========
For clarity, the Software will be deemed a part of the "Services" hereunder.
(b) Export Laws.
The Software and the transmission of applicable data is subject to United States export controls.
No Software may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws.
Downloading or using the Software is at your sole risk.
You shall also be responsible for using the Software in a manner that complies with all federal, state and local laws and the rules and regulations of all credit card companies.
==========
(c) Commercial Computer Software.
The Software and related documentation are "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," respectively, as such terms are used in United States Federal Acquisition Regulations Section 12.212.
Any use, duplication or disclosure of the Software or such documentation by or on behalf of the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in this TOS.
4.
==========
PAYMENT.
4.1 Independent Relationship of FPMs.
When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.
==========
4.2 Refunds.
It is the responsibility of Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Buyers and issue refunds to Buyers in accordance with such policy.
If Buyer desires to request a refund, Buyer must request the refund from Organizer.
==========
All disputes regarding refunds are between Organizer and Buyer and Eventbrite will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the Services.
All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks and refunds are between Organizer and Buyer and Eventbrite will not be liable in any way for chargebacks in connection with Buyer's use of the Services.
If you are a Buyer and you wish to request a refund in connection with an event listed on the Services, you should contact the applicable Organizer directly.
However, if you are unable to get a response from a particular Organizer or have a complaint about an Organizer or other user of the Services, please do not hesitate to contact us.
==========
4.3 Service Fees.
All descriptions of standard fees on the Services represent the standard fees that Eventbrite charges to Organizers.
Organizers ultimately choose how much of the fees charged by Eventbrite will be passed along to Buyers and may include certain other charges in the fees, including without limitation, facility fees, royalties, taxes, processing fees, and fulfillment fees.
Service fees may also vary based on individual agreements with certain Organizers.
Therefore, the fees paid by Buyers for an event are not necessarily the same as those charged by Eventbrite to the applicable Organizer or the standard fees described on the Services.
In addition, certain fees such as the credit card processing fee are fees meant, on average, to defray certain costs incurred by Eventbrite, but may in some cases include an element of profit and in some cases include an element of loss.
==========
4.4 Eventbrite as Payment Agent.
You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Eventbrite is not a party to the agreement between you and Organizer, Eventbrite acts as Organizer's payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of Organizer.
Upon Buyer's payment of amounts to Eventbrite which are due to Organizer, Buyer's payment obligation to Organizer for such amounts is extinguished, and Eventbrite is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Eventbrite's service fees, to Organizer.
In the event that Eventbrite does not remit any such amounts to Organizer, such Organizer will have recourse only against Eventbrite.
5.

==========
GENERAL.
21.1 Entire Agreement.
This TOS (and to the extent that you are an API developer, the API terms and conditions contained at http://developer.eventbrite.com/terms/) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Eventbrite and governs your use of the Services as a Buyer, API developer, Facebook Connect user or other non-Organizer user, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, discussions or communications between you and Eventbrite on the subject matter hereof.
You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third party Content, third party software or the Services in a manner other than as governed by this TOS.
==========
21.2 Choice of Law.
Except as set forth in Section 21.3, this TOS and the provision of the Services to you are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California by California residents.
21.3 Arbitration.
BINDING ARBITRATION: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM UNDER THIS TOS OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (TO THE EXTENT THE CLAIM QUALIFIES) AND WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY; CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS AND CIVIL ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED ONCE THIS SECTION IS EFFECTIVE.
==========
(a) Contact Us First.
If you have a question or concern about the Services, please contact us first.
Our customer support team will try to answer your question or resolve your concern.
==========
(b) Agreement to Arbitrate.
In the unlikely event that our customer support team is unable to resolve your concerns, we each hereby agree to resolve any and all disputes or claims under this TOS or with respect to the Services through binding arbitration or in small claims court (to the extent the claim qualifies) instead of in courts of general jurisdiction and only on an individual basis and not as part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding.
Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief as a court.
Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review.
==========
Only the arbitrator appointed pursuant to this Section, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the authority to resolve any dispute or claim relating to this Section, including, without limitation, the scope, enforceability and arbitrability hereof.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this TOS.
This TOS evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 21.3 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section 21.2 above.
==========
(c) Scope of Agreement.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to:
all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
all claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
all claims that may arise after the termination of this TOS and/or your use of the Services.
(d) Exceptions.
Notwithstanding this Agreement to arbitrate, either party may (i) bring an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the extent the applicable claim qualifies), (ii) bring issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Trade Commission and the California Division of Consumer Services, which agencies may be able to seek relief on a party's behalf (the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210), and (iii) bring suit in court to seek a preliminary injunction or other interim relief pending the outcome of arbitration.
In addition, the portion of any dispute or complaint relating to Eventbrite's participation in the US-EU or US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks is subject to the Dispute Resolution section of our Privacy Policy before being subject to this Section.
==========
(e) No Class Actions.
YOU AND EVENTBRITE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTAIVE PROCEEDING AND MAY ONLY PROVIDE RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.
==========
(f) Notice of Dispute.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
The Notice to Eventbrite must be addressed to the address in Section 19 above ("Notice Address") and must be sent by certified mail.
The Notice to you must be addressed to a mailing, home, or payment address currently on record with Eventbrite and must be sent by certified mail.
If no such physical address exists, such notice may be delivered to your Eventbrite account email address.
==========
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If Eventbrite and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Eventbrite may commence an arbitration proceeding.
(g) Arbitration Proceedings.
==========
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (and in addition, if the actions giving rise to the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use), the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes) (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Section 21.3, and will be administered by the AAA and settled by a single arbitrator.
The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this TOS.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 21.3.
==========
Unless Eventbrite and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA shall determine the location.
If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
==========
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
All decisions by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
(h) Costs of Arbitration; Legal Fees.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if (i) you are initiating an arbitration against Eventbrite, (ii) the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, and (iii) you include in the Notice your election to have Eventbrite pay all filing, administration and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA, then Eventbrite will pay such costs and expenses (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then Eventbrite will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
In the event that the arbitrator determines that any of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Eventbrite for all such cost and expenses that Eventbrite paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.
==========
Just as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration hereunder.
Should either party be determined to have substantially prevailed in the arbitration, then upon such party's request, the arbitrator shall award such prevailing party the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses that it incurred in connection with the arbitration, provided that to the extent that the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use) Eventbrite will not seek to recover its attorneys' fees and expenses in an arbitration initiated by you, unless the arbitrator determines that one or more of your claims are frivolous.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement of attorneys' fees and expenses upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
==========
(i) Future Changes.
Notwithstanding any provision in this TOS to the contrary, you and Eventbrite agree that if Eventbrite makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) Eventbrite will provide you with written notice of such change to your account email address and you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as unmodified by such rejected change.
==========
(j) Special Severability.
In the event that the provisions of subsection (e) above are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any dispute or claim, then, notwithstanding Section 21.4, the entirety of this Section 21.3 shall be null and void with respect to such dispute or claim and Section 21.5 shall apply in lieu of this Section 21.3.
(k) Opt Out.
==========
We believe that on a whole this agreement to arbitrate will benefit our users.
However, if you are an existing registered user and you do not wish to accept this agreement to arbitrate with respect to some or all of your accounts registered prior to October 8, 2013, you may opt-out by sending us a written notice to the Notice Address which (i) states you do not agree to this agreement to arbitrate, (ii) includes your name and all email addresses associated with the accounts you wish to opt-out, and (iii) is signed by the individual who owns the account, or in the event the account is held by an entity, an authorized signer for such entity (the "Opt-Out Notice").
The Opt-Out Notice must be received by November 30, 2013 in order to be effective; otherwise this agreement to arbitrate will be effective as of October 8, 2013.
For new registered users and existing registered users who register new accounts following October 8, 2013, there is no option to opt-out and this provision will be effective as to such new accounts upon account creation.
In the event that you opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate as set forth above, Section 21.5 of this TOS shall apply in lieu of this Section 21.3.
==========
21.4 Waiver; Invalid Provisions.
The failure or delay of Eventbrite to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
No oral waiver, amendment or modification shall be effective under any circumstance whatsoever.
Subject to Section 21.3(j), if any provision of this TOS is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this TOS shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
==========
21.5 Judicial Forum.
In the event that Section 21.3 shall be null and void as set forth in Section 21.3(j) above or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate as set forth in Section 21.3(k), then any dispute or claim not subject to arbitration shall be resolved exclusively by a federal court located in San Francisco County, California, and to the extent there is no subject matter jurisdiction in such federal court, then a state court in San Francisco County, California.
Both you and Eventbrite agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and agree that such forum is convenient.
21.6 Titles.
The section titles in this TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
==========
21.7 Violations.
Please report any violations of this TOS by email to support@eventbrite.com.
21.8 Assignment.
Eventbrite may freely assign this TOS, whether to an affiliate or to another entity in connection with a corporate transaction or otherwise.
You may not assign your rights or delegate your obligations under this TOS.
This TOS will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon each party's successors and assigns.
21.9 Relationship.
No independent contractor, agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this TOS.
