Information we collect and how we use it
We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as accessing psychoeducational information found on Psych Central.
In order to provide additional services, however, we may collect the following types of information:
Information you provide - When you sign up for a Psych Central Account or other Psych Central service that requires registration (e.g., for our community, blogging services, etc.), we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password).
We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Psych Central services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.
For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.

By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity.
Psych Central will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.
Advertising services â€“ Psych Central may use its own internal ad server or a reputable third party to present or serve website advertisements.

Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
Developing new services.
You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the privacy notices for particular services.
Choices for personal information
When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information.
==========
If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.
We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.
==========
You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Psych Central may not be able to provide those services to you.
Information sharing
Psych Central only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Psych Central in the following limited circumstances:
We have your consent.
We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.
We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
==========
We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Psych Central, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
If Psych Central becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
==========
We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information.
Such information does not identify you individually.
==========
Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.
Information security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
We restrict access to personal information to Psych Central employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.
These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
==========
Data integrity
Psych Central processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.
We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services.
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
Accessing and updating personal information
When you use Psych Central services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.
==========
In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information.
We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.
==========
Enforcement
Psych Central regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy.
Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Psych Central's treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at: Chief Privacy Officer, Psych Central, PO Box 5464, Bradford MA 01835 USA.
When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Psych Central's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns.
We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Psych Central and an individual.
==========
Changes to this policy
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.
Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes).
Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.
