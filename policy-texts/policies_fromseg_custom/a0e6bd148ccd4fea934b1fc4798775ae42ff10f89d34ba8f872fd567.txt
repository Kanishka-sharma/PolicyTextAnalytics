These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and ad networks that may collect information about you when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.
Third parties that may serve, track and/or analyze ads on our Services, and thereby may collect information about your online activities on such Services include, but are not limited to, the third parties listed on CBS Interactive Third Party Ad Technology Providers.

Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites.
CBS Interactive is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.

In addition, CBS Interactive works with third parties to help us track the advertisements that are delivered to you, in particular to control the number of times you receive the same advertisements, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising on the CBS Interactive Services.
Third parties that use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to help us with traffic measurement, research and analytics include Adobe, Comscore, Nielsen and ConfirmIT.
We do not share contact information with these third parties.
