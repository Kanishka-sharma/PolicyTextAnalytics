LiveJasmin offers a wide variety of Models.
To find one who fits a certain taste or preference, Members may use a search bar on the top of any page.

What is VIP Show?

Come together!
With VIP Shows, you and other members can enjoy a hot and steamy show.

Every VIP Show has a pre-show, to give time for members to join in and contribute to the VIP Show’s Credit goal.
==========
Models also include descriptions of their shows, to tell you what you can expect in their shows.
VIP Shows will only start if the model manually starts them or if the Credit goal is reached.
Once the VIP Show starts, only those members that gave the minimum amount of Credits or more can enjoy the show.
