Relevant Legal Grounds
Below you will find the legal grounds of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that form the basis for the way in which we process personal data.
Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may also apply in your and our country of residence and business.
National Data Protection Regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations also apply for the protection of data in Germany.
==========
One of the most prominent of these is the law aimed at protecting against the misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG).
In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions covering the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to objection, the processing of special categories of data, processing for other purposes, data transfer, as well as automated decision-making including profiling.
Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of employment (Section 26 BDSG), especially with regard to hiring, carrying out, or terminating contracts of employment as well as employees’ consent.
Also, state data protection legislations may apply in individual federal states.
==========
Rights of Data Subjects
As a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR, you enjoy various rights, in particular those arising from Articles 15 to 18 and 21 GDPR:
Right of objection: You have the right to lodge an objection at any time for reasons arising from your specific situation against the processing of personal data relating to you based on Article 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
If personal data relating to you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of the personal data relating to you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
Right to withdraw consent: You have the right to withdraw consent that you have already given at any time.
==========
Right to information: You are entitled to request confirmation as to whether relevant data are processed and to information about these data as well as to additional information and a copy of the data in accordance with statutory provisions.
Right to rectification: You are entitled to request the completion of the data relating to you or the rectification of inaccurate data relating to you in accordance with statutory provisions.
Right to erasure and restriction of processing: In accordance with statutory provisions, you are entitled to request that data relating to you be immediately erased or, as an alternative, that the processing of your data be restricted in accordance with statutory provisions (“blocking”).
Right to data portability: You have the right to request to receive the personal data relating to you that you provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, or to request transmission of those data to another controller in accordance with statutory provisions.
Complaint to a supervisory authority: Furthermore, you have the right in accordance with statutory provisions to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, especially in the Member State of your usual place of residence, place of work or place of the alleged breach, if you think that the processing of the personal data relating to you breaches the GDPR.
==========
Presence in Social Networks
Wagawin GmbH maintains an online presence in social networks in order to communicate with users active there or to provide information about us there.
We wish to point out that users’ data may be processed outside the European Union (EU).
This may result in risks for users, as, for example, this may make it difficult for them to assert their rights.
We also wish to point out that US providers certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield or who offer similar guarantees of a secure level of data protection thereby undertake to comply with the data protection standards of the EU.
==========
Furthermore, user data in social networks are generally processed for market research and advertising purposes.
This may result in the creation of usage profiles based on user behavior and user interests derived from this.
The usage profiles may in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within or outside of the networks that are likely to match the interests of users.
==========
To this end, cookies are generally saved on user devices that store user behavior and interests.
Furthermore, data may also be stored in usage profiles independently of the user devices (in particular when users are members of the platforms in question and are logged in there).
==========
We would direct you to the data privacy statements and information of the operators of the networks in question for a more detailed description of the relevant forms of processing and the options to object (opt-outs).
We would also point out that any requests for information and the claims to assert data subject rights should be best addressed to the providers themselves.
Only the providers have access to the relevant user data and are able to take corresponding measures directly and provide information.
==========
However, if you still require assistance, you can contact datenschutz@wagawin.com.
Types of data processed: Master data (e.g. names, addresses), contact details (e.g. e-mail addresses, phone numbers), content data (e.g. text input, photographs, video clips), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
Data subjects: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
Purposes of processing: Contact requests and communication, tracking (e.g. interests-/behavior-based profiling, use of cookies), remarketing, reach measurement (e.g. access statistics, recognition of repeat visitors).

WAGAWIN – PRODUCT PRIVACY POLICY
1.
Introduction
Wagawin GmbH (“Wagawin”, “we”, “us”) respects your privacy and we are responsible for taking care of it.
This privacy policy will tell you about your relationship with us.
We therefore ask you to read them carefully.
This privacy statement is intended for end users of Wagawin’s advertising services, called “LivingAds”.
Why you should read this privacy statement:
Many website operators and app developers make their content available free of charge.
==========
But of course they also have to pay their bills.
That’s why they broadcast advertisements to you.
We help to place advertisements on websites and in apps.
==========
As you know, advertising is often annoying and boring.
That’s why we create interactive advertising and try to show you the advertising that is interesting for you.
==========
To accomplish this, however, we need some information about you that the Data Protection Act (DS-GVO) classifies as personal data.
If we store personal data about you, this is only an identification number or a cookie that is stored in your browser.
We will never be able to find out your name, birthday or address and therefore will not store it.
Your personal data will only be processed by us if this is necessary to fulfil the contract, if we or the third party have a legitimate interest in the processing or if you have given your consent.
To ensure that your are well informed about your privacy rights we want
To inform you about the way in which we use your personal data
To ensure that you understand what information we collect, what we do with it, and most importantly, do not do with it
To show us responsible for the protection of your data and rights within the framework of this privacy statement /li>
2.
==========
Our service called “LivingAds“
Wagawin provides advertising & marketing services for our Advertiser clients (“Advertisers”).
When it comes to mobile advertising, we think interaction matters.
==========
Therefore we provide ad formats, called LivingAds, that allow users to interact with advertising content.
Our service helps our advertisers’ ads to generate higher awareness and higher performance as we show ads to users that are interacting with advertising content.
Furthermore, we aim to make advertising more useful and relevant to users by showing ads that are best tied to their specific interests.
Our platform uses interaction data, as well as other data described below, to help Advertisers provide ads to you that are more relevant to you.
3.
==========
What personal data we collect
Publishers can choose how to receive LivingAds.
No matter if publishers use our SDK or API or provide their traffic programmatically, we collect device and browser information for the purpose described below.
This is technical information about the device or browser you use to access the Advertiser’s website.
==========
For example, your device’s IP address, cookie string data, operating system, and (in the case of mobile devices) your device type and mobile device’s unique identifier such as the Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID.
Knowing this basic information, we collect certain data about the ads we served (or attempted to serve) to you.
It includes things like how many times an ad has been served to you, what page the ad appeared on, and whether you clicked on or interacted with the ad.
4.
==========
How we process the personal data we collect
We use this data to help our Advertisers identify and serve ads to you that are more relevant to you.
We also use this data to operate, improve and enhance our services including enhancing the data points we or our Advertising Partners have about a particular user, browser, or device to serve the most relevant ads to you and, in turn, improve performance of an Advertiser’s ad campaigns.
Specifically, we use this data for:
Re-Targeting: Selecting ads that are more likely to be relevant to you based on the interests previously associated with your device and the time of day you may be most interested in viewing these specific ads
Frequency capping: Making sure that you don’t see the same ad too many times
Sequencing: If you are being served a sequence of ads, making sure we show you the right ad next in the sequence
Attribution: Monitoring when, where, and at what price we served certain ads on behalf of an Advertiser so that we can measure our influence on the marketing result of the Advertiser’s campaigns and overall marketing strategy
Reporting: Providing Advertisers insights into how their ads are performing and gain insights into their customers.
Reporting may include ad metrics such as impressions, interactions, clicks, and conversions (however the Advertiser may define a “conversion,” for example, a sale or a white paper download).
Fraud Detection: By using the ad metrics mentioned above, we focus on real users and dismiss fraudulant traffic
Maintenance: The maintenance of the system and the ongoing operations.

9.
Security
We apply technical, administrative and organizational security measures to protect the data we collect against accidental or unlawful destruction and loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against other unlawful forms of processing.

The GDPR gives you specific rights to your personal data we process; these rights include obtaining copies of it, requesting changes to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in a common electronic format so it can be moved to another controller.
To exercise your rights, just contact us on the address stated in section 11.
