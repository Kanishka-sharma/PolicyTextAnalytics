At Lonely Planet, we understand that privacy is 
			  really important.
So we have prepared this privacy policy to fill 
			  you in on who we are, our objectives in handling personal information 
			  that we collect, and how you can find out more about our privacy 
			  philosophy and the personal information that we collect about you.
Who 
			  are we?
==========
What we collect and why
But it isn't about me!
What about "cookies"?
You tell who?
Complaints, comments or corrections?
So who are 
			  we?
==========
Lonely Planet operates through different companies 
			  around the world that are all part of the Lonely 
			  Planet family.
Individual Lonely Planet companies sometimes 
			  need to share personal information with other companies in the group 
			  to let us provide the quality products and standard of service you've 
			  come to expect of us.
If corporate structure excites you, click 
			  here to learn more about the Lonely 
			  Planet family of companies.

What 
			  do we collect and why do we collect it?
There will be situations in which it is necessary 
              for us to collect information about individuals.
We collect and 
              hold personal information such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, 
              and phone numbers.
If customers choose to purchase Lonely Planet 
              products or services, we collect credit card details and other identifying 
              information in order to process orders and provide customer service.
Our writers (some of whom work on contract to us) may also collect 
              personal information in the course of gathering material for inclusion 
              in our publications (although you won't always know who they are 
              at the time as we need to get the real story!)

              our Media Privacy Policy.
The types of purposes 
              for which we collect information about individuals include the following 
              (we'll generally explain more about why we collect personal information 
              when we actually collect it - but there are some exceptions): 

 obtaining 

                and responding to feedback from travellers
 allowing 

                people to share their experiences with fellow travellers on our 

                bulletin boards
 sending 

                our print and digital newsletters to travellers who ask for them
 processing 

                purchase orders and providing technical support
 offering 

                on-the-road communications services

                contacting customers with exciting travel news and great Lonely 

                Planet offers (but only if they have asked us to).
We may also collect information about individuals 

              involved in businesses, and this is mainly for: 

preparing 

                listings and reviews in our publications
 sending 

                information about Lonely Planet and our products to our media 

                and other industry contacts
 distributing 

                our products to distributors and retailers.
==========
If you work for us (as an employee or under contract) 
			  we keep information about you in the context of that relationship.
There are some differences in how we deal with that type of personal 
			  information because of the relationship, plus some housekeeping 
			  stuff.
If you are in this group and want further information on 
			  how we deal in the information about you, please contact your Human 
			  Resources manager or the person who manages your relationship with 
			  us.

But it isn't 
			  about me!
==========
One of the best things about the Lonely Planet 
			  community is that everyone is keen to share their views and experiences 
			  with others.
(If you don't believe us, just check out the thousands 
			  of daily posts at the Thorn 
			  Tree, our message boards.)
We welcome your contributions 
			  (please don't stop!)
.
==========
But remember, what's "gossip" to you may deserve 
			  "privacy" in someone else's eyes.
We think everyone in the Lonely 
			  Planet community (or even outside it) has the right to some privacy.
So please respect the privacy of others.
==========
If you want to include 
			  information about yourself we'll take it that you understand how 
			  our services work and are happy for that information to be shared.
If you are unhappy that personal information about you has 
			  been included in one of our publications or on one of our bulletin 
			  boards, please let 
			  us know.
Where reasonable and possible we will remove 
			  that information at the next practical opportunity - where it has 
			  been included in one of our publications that may be the next reprint 
			  or next edition.

What about 
			  "cookies"?
A "cookie" is a small message given to your web 
			  browser by our web server.
The browser stores the message in a text 
			  file, and the message is then sent back to the server each time 
			  the browser requests a page from the server.
We make limited use 
			  of cookies on our website for the purposes of tailoring our web 
			  pages to your needs (this may include recording what region of the 
			  world you are from so we don't make the mistake of requiring you 
			  to buy stuff with British Pounds when you live in Fiji - or Australia 
			  for that matter at current exchange rates!)
.
We do not match cookies 
			  to your registration details (that is, if you are registered with 
			  us) and we do not use cookies to track your movements after leaving 
			  this website.

You tell 
			  who?
We may share personal information amongst companies 
			  in the Lonely Planet family.
We may also disclose that information 
			  to our travel writers and other contractors who help us put together 
			  the Lonely Planet products and services you know and love and, where 
			  relevant, to our business partners who assist us in providing these 
			  products and services.
We will generally provide you with more details 
			  about who we tell and why we tell them when we ask you to give us 
			  your personal details.
There are some limited exceptions to this 
			  (for instance, where under Australian or other privacy laws we are 
			  permitted to rely on exemptions relating to handling of employee 
			  information, our activities in journalism, or information sharing 
			  between related companies in the Lonely Planet family).
If legal 
			  or health and safety issues arise we may also have to make disclosures 
			  to relevant organisations to deal with these matters.

Complaints, 
			  comments or corrections?
For some Lonely Planet services you can access 
			  your registration and keep your personal information up to date 
			  on line.
To correct or update your other personal information, or 
			  if you have any questions about personal information, please contact 
			  us by e-mail 
			  or by writing to us at Locked Bag 1, Footscray, Victoria 3011, Australia.

A world without lawyers… 
…it's a nice thought.
However, for the time being 
			  the information handling activities of the Lonely Planet Group are 
			  governed by privacy laws throughout the world.
For instance, in 
			  Australia that means being guided by the Australian 
			  National Privacy Principles.
