1 -About Criteo’s services 
Criteo specializes in creating personalized advertisements.
We work with online partners to build advertisements for users who visit their website or mobile applications and with publishers to display personalized advertisements.
Our aim is to deliver advertisements by displaying products and/or personalized banners that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing behavior.
For example, if you visit and browse on Website/mobile application A, on a subsequent online visit to Website/mobile application B, you will see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website/mobile application A.
With our service, you should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Criteo.

2 – Our technology 
Online web environment: (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)
Criteo “tags” visitors to its partners’ websites with browser cookies.
Users tagged by Criteo are given a technical identifier.
At no point does Criteo collect identifying personal data such as your name or address.
==========
The browser cookies track the products viewed by the visitor and pages visited of the partner for whom Criteo is delivering ads.
Pixel tags are used by Criteo to transfer browsing data from visitors of our partner's websites to Criteo's servers.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
==========
There are two types of cookies:
Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate on websites.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
Persistent cookies are used to run our technology as they enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our partners’ websites.
Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your internet browser’s ‘help’ file.
==========
What are pixel tags?
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon) is an industry-standard, often-transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed in a website.
Our partners’ advertisements are displayed on many websites, also known as “publishers.”
These publishers may also place cookies on your browser.
These cookies are there so that the publishers recognize that Criteo has a personalized advertisement available for your browser.
Other environments (Mobile applications) 
In environments that do not support cookies, like mobile applications, we may use other similar technologies for the same purpose of cookies.
To serve our ads in mobile applications we collect identifiers, such as Google Advertising ID or Apple IDFA depending on the operating system of your mobile device.
These identifiers consist in a string of technical and random characters singling out your device that Criteo stored by Criteo with a hash (non reversible encrypting method).
==========
Matching environments: (browsers and mobile apps used) 
To serve you our personalized advertisements and provide a seamless online experience, we may match your identifiers on the different environments you are using (“ID syncing”).
At no point we collect identifying personal data such as your name or address to operate the matching.
We use exact matching methods by leveraging the technical data collected through our technology such as our advertising partner’s identifiers or email hash that they may pass to us.
See data collection paragraph to learn more.
3 - Data collection and use
We do not know who you are.
We collect and use anonymous data relating to your browsing navigation to display personalized advertisements.
We collect browsing information
In order to serve you advertisements that are the more relevant to your interests, we collect data related to your browsing activity through cookies or equivalent identifiers that record:
events related to your activity on our advertising partner’s website (such as the number of pages viewed, the products you viewed on that website, your searches made on the partner’s website)
information related to your device (device type, operating system, version)
and events related to the Criteo ad serving activity such as the number of ads displayed to you.
We also collect technical user identifiers from our advertising partners for the purpose of matching the different browsers and mobile apps you use and serve you relevant ads based on your behaviour across environments (“ID syncing”).
For that purpose we process and store
Technical IDs of our advertising partners, and/or a hashed version of your CRM ID or of your email address – the hashing method used is the MD5 which is a non-reversible encrypting method.
MD5 of your email correspond to a series of characters that does not permit your identification.
For eg : a hash of name@mail.com would be 95ad3e9a65078288849e0ce56cf032c4 
Mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple IDFA or Google AAID) which are specific technical data created by mobile manufacturers to allow personalization and customer analytics in a secure and non-identifying way for users
Finally, we can collect technical identifiers from third parties for the purpose of improving our ID syncing and be sure to offer you a seamless online experience.
These trusted partners commit to only share ID corresponding to deterministic matches made between cookies and/or mobile identifiers and to provide an efficient choice mechanism to end users (opt-out).
For eg : the matching information sourced from our partners could be Cookie ID ABC = Apple IDFA 123 = MD5 hashed value)

*In compliance with the best industry standards, we use IP addresses: 
For fraud detection purposes (and not for targeting purposes) to help alert us to situations which could not have been caused by human behavior, such as a massive amount of clicking in a limited period of time; or
