Our Commitment to Privacy.
Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc.
("Britannica") is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to  its family of Web sites (collectively, the "Britannica sites" and  each, a "Britannica site").
==========
Except as otherwise provided, this Privacy  Policy applies to all of the Britannica sites, which include, but are not  limited to, Britannica.com,  Store.Britannica.com and EB.com.
To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online  information practices and the choices you can make about the way your  information is collected and used at this Britannica site.
The Britannica sites are general audience Web  sites, intended for Users of all ages.
Personal information of Users may be  collected, used, and disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy.
The Information
                We Collect.
To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest  quality services, we collect and apply information from our interactions with  visitors and subscribers (each a "User") to the Britannica sites, as  well as from other parties.
Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures  to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and  responsible manner.
==========
The information we receive and collect depends on what a  User does when visiting one of the Britannica sites.
Your Personal Information.
In general, our Users are able to visit many  of our Web pages without telling us who they are or revealing any information  about themselves.
As discussed under "Usage  Data" below, we may track the Internet domain or "Internet  protocol" addresses from which Users visit us and analyze this data in the  aggregate to determine usage for trends and statistics.
Individual Users will  remain anonymous, unless they voluntarily tell us who they are.
==========
There may be times, however, such as when subscribing to our services, making purchases from the Britannica Store, or contributing content to a Britannica site, when we ask Users to provide certain Personal Information about themselves.
"Personal Information" may include, but is not limited to, the name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit or charge card information of a Britannica site User.
Whether or not a User provides such information is completely his or her own choice.
If a User chooses not to provide the Personal Information we request, he or she may be unable to access certain services and content on our Britannica sites, purchase products from us, or contribute content to a Britannica site.
==========
Demographic Information.
There will also be opportunities for  subscribers to provide us with demographic or profile information regarding  their preferences and interests.
This information may include, but is not  limited to, age, gender, household income, level of education completed, number  of children in the household, and personal-interest information.
This  demographic information, however, is not required and is completely optional on  a subscriber's part.
==========
Prospect and Referral Information.
If a User visits a Britannica site and  submits an e-mail address to Britannica but fails to complete the registration  or purchase process, we may use such "prospect" information to  contact the prospective User from time to time with Britannica offers and  information about new features, new services, and special discounts we think  the User may see as valuable.
Similarly, if a User forwards a Britannica e-mail  to a friend, we may use the "referral" information provided to  contact the friend from time to time with Britannica offers and information  about new features, new services, and special discounts we think the friend may  see as valuable.
==========
All of our "prospect" and "referral"  communications contain clearly marked opt-out instructions.
The types of  personally identifiable information that may be collected in relation to  "prospects" or "referrals" include: name and e-mail  addresses.
We do not sell or rent any contact information for such  "prospects" or "referrals."
==========
Cookies.
To help you personalize your online experience,  Britannica uses "Cookies."
"Cookies" are pieces of  information that Britannica transfers to the hard drives of Users for  record-keeping purposes.
One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a  convenience feature to save you time.
==========
For example, Cookies allow us to  recognize you when you re-enter a Britannica site so that you will not have to  log in each time you visit.
Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique  and return visitors who use the Britannica sites.
In addition, Britannica places  Cookies with Users visiting from advertising banners and hyperlinks on other  Web sites to track the success of a particular advertising campaign or  marketing program.
==========
Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies.
If you  prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a Cookie  or, alternatively, to refuse to accept Cookies.
It is important to note that  you may not be able to use certain features on a Britannica site if you choose  not to accept Cookies.
The use of Cookies is an industry standard and occurs at  most major Web sites.
Beacons.
==========
We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications.
We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site.
To do this, we use Web beacons and Cookies provided by our marketing company on this site.
==========
The type of information we collect includes pages visited, search terms, referrers, campaigns, anonymous user identifier, and anonymous account identifiers.
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.
Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this Web site analysis tool by clicking here.
How We Use the

Britannica  does not include in any of the Britannica sites any functionality for  performing "reverse searches" to identify Web site Users from their  e-mail addresses.
However, as discussed below, Britannica reserves the right to  analyze and utilize Personal Information in order to more effectively optimize  the User experience and to present certain opportunities to Users for their  benefit.
Demographic Information.
In an ongoing effort  to improve its services, Britannica may use aggregated demographic information  to draw conclusions about Users' wishes and preferences.
Britannica may also  provide demographic information in the aggregate regarding Britannica site  Users to third parties in connection with Britannica advertising campaigns and  marketing programs; however, no demographic information relating to any  individual Britannica site User is disclosed without the express consent of  such User.
In addition, any such User may withdraw his/her consent at any time  by following the instructions provided under the heading "How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove  Personal Information" below.
As stated above, submitting such  demographic information is not required and is completely optional on a User‚Äôs  part.

We do not sell or rent any contact information for such prospects  or referrals.
Usage Data.
We only use Usage Data in the aggregate.
==========
We look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis.
This data helps us determine the extent to which our visitors use certain parts of a Britannica site, which, in turn, enables us to make the Britannica sites as appealing as possible.
We may also provide statistical "ratings" about how our visitors collectively use our Web sites to business partners (advertisers and other companies with which we do business.)
We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of the Web sites in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience.
These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about any of our individual Users.
==========
Information Disclosed in Public Areas.
Certain Britannica sites allow for the sharing of information.
You should remember that any Personal Information you submit to such areas (for example, online chat rooms and forums) may be viewed by other visitors to that site.
As a result, your Personal Information may be viewed, collected and used by third parties over whom Britannica has no control.
Britannica is not responsible for either the information you submit in such public areas or the use that may be made of such information by any third party.
