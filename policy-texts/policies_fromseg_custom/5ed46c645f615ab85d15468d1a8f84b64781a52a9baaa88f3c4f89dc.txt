This privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) describes privacy practices which are specific to the SurveyMonkey survey-taking mobile app (“SurveyMonkey Rewards”) and should be read in conjunction with our main Privacy Policy (“Main Privacy Policy”) and where there is a conflict this Privacy Statement takes precedence.
SurveyMonkey Rewards is used by people who are interested in taking surveys using the SurveyMonkey Rewards (“Panelists” or “you”).
The people who create the surveys taken by Panelists (“Survey Creators”) are either (i) users of SurveyMonkey’s services or (ii) a certain third party, Sense 360 ('Sense360'), who we use to map certain non-personal data to specific venues and locations or Sense360’s customers and in both the case of (i) and (ii) are interested in sending surveys to Panelists through SurveyMonkey Rewards.
SurveyMonkey Rewards is only offered for use in the U.S.
If you are located outside the U.S., you should not be able to access or use SurveyMonkey Rewards.This Privacy Statement describes how SurveyMonkey Inc. (“SurveyMonkey” or “we” or “our”) collects, uses, shares and protects the personal information you provide as a Panelist using SurveyMonkey Rewards.
==========
It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
We refer to surveys conducted through SurveyMonkey Rewards as “SurveyMonkey Rewards surveys,” and these are treated differently than surveys conducted through SurveyMonkey's main website.WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES SURVEYMONKEY COLLECTRegistration InformationYou are required to create a SurveyMonkey Rewards user account (a “SurveyMonkey Rewards User Account”) to use SurveyMonkey Rewards as a Panelist.

Do not share your device if you wish to prevent this possibility.Profile DataTo allow Survey Creators to target Panelists with specific characteristics when conducting surveys, we build profiles of Panelists.
We build up your profile by asking you to answer questions about yourself and from device and metadata data we collect about your device.
See “Device and Metadata Data” section below for more information on that.
==========
We refer to all of this information as “profile data.”
When compiling profile data, we may collect your demographic information (e.g., year of birth, gender, employment status, the industry in which you work, ethnicity, religion, income level, education level, country of residence, zip code, political views, home ownership status, marital status, number of children, etc.), interests (e.g., what activities you participate in and how often you participate), preferences (e.g., what sort of food or drinks you like, and places you visit assuming you have turned on location tracking on your mobile device).
Survey Response DataWe collect your survey response data which may directly identify you or which, when used with other information which we hold about you, may identify you.
For more details of how we treat survey responses generally and the appropriate owner of your responses, see the Survey Respondent section of our Main Privacy Policy.Inferred DataWe may infer information about you (e.g., your shopping preferences and habits) from the above personal information which we collect about you.Usage DataWe receive usage data about you whenever you interact with the SurveyMonkey Rewards through a third party analytics provider.
==========
This may include which pages and screens within SurveyMonkey Rewards you visit, what you click on, and which surveys you complete.
Additionally, like most mobile apps, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.
The log files may include Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.Device and Metadata DataWe receive data from the device you use to access SurveyMonkey Rewards, such as your operating system version, device manufacturer and model, carrier (i.e., mobile provider), system locale.
We may also store any information collected by the core SDK, like device name (can be personalized by device owner) and user agent string.
==========
We also collect data through the use of cookies.
Please see our cookies policy for more information.Provision of Information is VoluntaryYou can always choose not to provide any personal information that we ask you for.
However, your ability to use the SurveyMonkey Rewards may be limited if you do not give information that we require to provide you with our services.
For example:If you do not provide profile data, you may be unable to participate in surveys or your chances of being chosen for a survey may be reduced.If you do not enable your location tracking on your device at the device level, we cannot service you with location based surveys.Sensitive InformationWe will treat sensitive information (e.g, personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or affiliations, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information related to one’s sexual preferences) with particular care.
You may be asked to provide sensitive information as part of your profile data.
If we intend to disclose such information to a third party or use it for a purpose other than as described in this privacy statement, we will obtain your specific permission to do so prior to any such use or disclosure.HOW DOES SURVEYMONKEY USE YOUR INFORMATION?To provide you with relevant surveysWe use your profile data to target surveys and send you invitations to take those surveys.
==========
For e.g., if the profile data you provide shows you are a 30 year old female living in New York who was recently in the vicinity of a local branch of an international chain of coffee shops, we may send you a survey from a survey creator that is interested in the opinions of any person living in New York between age 25-35 who was recently in the vicinity of the local branch.To improve SurveyMonkey RewardsWe internally use the data we receive to improve the quality of our service.
For e.g., we use and analyze usage data (such as page view data and response rates) to make the surveys we send more relevant to you, to improve the SurveyMonkey Rewards user interface and to maintain a consistent and reliable user experience.
We use profile data to help us to improve the quality of panel which we surface for Survey Creators.To provide Survey Creators with more targeting criteriaWe may use your survey responses to provide other Survey Creators with more ways to reach the target demographic they want.
However, we do not give your actual survey responses to Survey Creators other than the survey creator actually conducting the survey.
==========
For example, assume that you disclose in a survey that your stock portfolio has 21 stocks and assume further that we allow Survey Creators to target Panelists based on their stock portfolio sizes.To verify complianceWe may inspect your survey responses to ensure your compliance with the SurveyMonkey Rewards Terms of Use.WHO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION TO AND WHAT INFORMATION WE SHARESense360We disclose certain non-personal data (geographic data like latitude and longitude and other sensor data such as speed, bearing, list of installed apps, accelerometer, and vertical accuracy) with Sense360.
Sense360 uses that data to determine information about your device such as its location, acceleration, and orientation and to assist us in understanding and mapping your device to specific venues and locations, but we do not disclose your identity to Sense 360.
Sense360 may use that data to send you surveys through the SurveyMonkey Rewards (see “Survey Creators” section below for more information on that) so in that instance Sense360 and its customer can be survey creators / users of SurveyMonkey’s services.
Sense360 may also use that data for additional purposes.

These policies detail how they handle your information and if one is provided, we encourage you to read them.
==========
SurveyMonkey’s Privacy Statement only applies to treatment of your information by SurveyMonkey and a Survey Creator’s privacy policy should be limited to the manner in which that Survey Creator will treat your information.
In circumstances where there is any conflict between this Privacy Statement and a Survey Creator’s privacy policy (in terms of the Survey Creator purporting to mandate how SurveyMonkey treats your information), this Privacy statement will take precedence.
Basic demographics to Survey CreatorsWhen you respond to a survey, we automatically provide the survey creator with a specific set of information about you that we compile from your profile data for the survey creator.
We refer to this set of information as “basic demographics”.
It includes your:Year of birthGenderEmployment status (e.g. full-time employed, full-time student, retired, etc.)Industry in which you workEthnicityIncomeLevel of educationCountry of residenceZip codeLanguagesPolitical views (e.g. liberal or conservative)ReligionHome ownership statusMarital statusNumber of children living in your householdGeographic locationThe sharing of your basic demographics happens behind the scenes and is not visible on the survey.

Of course, if you disclose your name in a survey, you won’t be anonymous.
But even if you don’t, the personal information you do provide may become identifying when combined with other information.
Remember that Survey Creators are also supplied with your basic demographics.
To help preserve your anonymity, we require a survey creator’s targeting criteria to match a certain minimum number of Panelists before we allow the survey to be conducted.To SurveyMonkey, the answer is no.
==========
We link your responses back to your username but never fear, we do not abuse or exploit this.
We do this to provide Survey Creators with additional targeting criteria (see “How does SurveyMonkey use your information?”
above).
