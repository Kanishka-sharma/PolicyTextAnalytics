DoubleClick Privacy Statement


Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to DoubleClick, its advertisers and our affiliate Web sites.
Below is information about DoubleClick's commitment to protecting the privacy of users and to ensuring the integrity of the medium.
Anonymity
All users who receive an ad targeted by DoubleClick's technology remain completely anonymous.
We do not sell or rent any information to third parties.
Because of our efforts to keep users anonymous, the information DoubleClick has is useful only across sites using the DoubleClick technology and only in the context of ad selection.
Opt Out
Cookies are small text files a Web site can use (thousands of sites are currently using them) to recognize a repeat visitor to its site.
Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage files.
==========
DoubleClick's cookie contains no information about you - only a unique number with no meaning whatsoever outside of the DoubleClick sites.
DoubleClick uses this number for tracking ad effectiveness.
One example of this is measuring ad frequency.
In other words, to assure a user is not bombarded with the same ad over and over again.
==========
Cookies are also used to determine what users are interested in.
For example, users who click on sports ads, tend to be interested in car ads also.
Finally, DoubleClick uses cookies to measure how users utilize an advertiser's site.
This helps our advertisers cater their content to best answer the needs of their customers.
While we believe that cookies enhance the Web experience for the user by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising.
If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows the user to deny or accept this feature.

While some third parties offer programs to manually delete your cookies, DoubleClick goes one step further by offering you a "blank" or "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being stored.
