==========
These logs capture
computer information and navigation and click-stream data,
such as the originating IP (e.g. 18.29.0.1) address of an agent requesting
a URL.
This data is used in non-identifiable form; we do
not log the the specific identity of visitors.
For web site and system
administration purposes, we occasionally analyze the log files to
determine which files are most requested and the previous site or user agent
which prompted the request.
Our logging is passive; we do not use
technologies such as cookies to maintain any information on users.
We also log transaction data, such as requests to our search,
cgi, and list maintenance services.
This data is only used for
completion and support of your requests and researching
the efficacy of our tools.
==========
Logged information is not disclosed outside of W3C host site personnel.
Aggregate
(completely non-identifying) statistics generated from these logs may be
reported as part of research results.
The logs are permanently archived as
raw research material.

W3C Privacy Statement for Members



Summary:
  

    We use member related information for the purposes of administering the W3C,
    and communicating and collaborating with our members.
This statement applies to member interactions with the
W3C Member Web site.
It does not apply to
our non-member site nor email sent to W3C staff or lists.
Any questions regarding
the web site and the privacy policy can be directed to
site-policy@w3.org .
==========
Email
interactions are guided by general net-etiquette conventions.
Members' interactions with the site are authenticated.
Consequently we have
the capability to identify users and their activities.
==========
By requesting a password you are added to our newsletter mailing list and
    your identity is relayed to Advisory Committee representative (AC rep).
We trace membership of lists for chairmen of Working Groups, and at the request
    of AC representatives -- but only for people in their organization.
This is commensurate with the AC representative role as the single and
responsible point of contact for their organization.
Very often, the participants of an activity and the project manager or working
group chair will determine the degree of publicity inherent to a specific
W3C activity.
