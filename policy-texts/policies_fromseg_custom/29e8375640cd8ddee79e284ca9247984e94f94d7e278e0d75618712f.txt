==========
MEMBER CONDUCT AS TO COPYRIGHT POLICIES
a. Music Copyright Policy: Project Playlist is an information location tool intended to help you find and enjoy music legally posted by others on the Internet.
Project Playlist intends to organize in its search index location information about music posted on the Internet for promotional and other legal purposes to serve artists and their fans.
Project Playlist is also committed to respecting the legitimate interests of copyright owners.
Therefore, where possible, Project Playlist negotiates reasonable copyright licenses that also respect the public.s legitimate interest in gaining access to public information and preserving the freedom and functionality of the Internet.
Project Playlist pays performance royalties to ASCAP, BMI and SESAC, the three performance rights organizations (.
PSOs.)
==========
based in the Untied States.
These three PSOs have reciprocal agreements with PSOs throughout the world.
The creators and publishers of the songs you hear through www.projectplaylist.com are being paid a royalty for their work if they are members of ASCAP, BMI or SESAC or any one of over 125 other PSOs that represent songwriters and music publishers around the world.
Project Playlist also respects the choices of performing artists as to when and where they want their music heard.
==========
Some performing artists make their music freely available on the web (see by way of example and not limitation: trade-friendly artists, creative commons licenses, and netlabels); others allow you to listen to only a few songs for promotional purposes; and a few would prefer that none of their music be heard on the web at all.
If an artist informs Project Playlist that the Project Playlist search engine is linking to an illegally posted song, Project Playlist, takes down the link to that music file in accordance with the law.
Because the Project Playlist search engine indexes files posted for promotional and other legal purposes and because users are permitted to add links to music files that they believe are legally posted, the music files that you can access through Project Playlist are constantly changing.
When users use the Project Playlist search engine over a period of months, users will find that links to certain songs in a playlist have become inactive.
==========
That occurs when the copyright owner has removed the music file from the Internet for one reason or another.
b. User Compliance with Copyright Policy: As a user of the Service, you agree that you will not circumvent the Project Playlist copyright policy by (i) adding links to the Project Playlist search index when you know that the links are to music files that have not been posted by the copyright owner for promotional or other legal purposes, (ii) uploading music files to a site and then adding the URL to the Project Playlist search index unless you are the owner of the copyright in the music, or (iii) representing that you are the owner of a copyright in a music file for the purpose of adding that file to the Project Playlist search index when you are not the owner.
c.
==========
Other Copyrights: Project Playlist does allow members to post photos and designs to member profile web pages.
Photos and designs are also subject to copyright protection.
You agree that you will not post other copyrighted material on your member web profile without the permission of the copyright owner to do so.
7.
