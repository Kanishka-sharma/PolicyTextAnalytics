In this policy, the words "we", "our", and "us" refer to Nordstrom Direct (www.Nordstrom.com) and the phrases "personally identifiable information" or "personal information" mean any information by which you can be identified or contacted, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, etc.

We may also collect personal information about you from other third parties, such as demographic firms, to make our future marketing efforts more efficient.
How We Use Your Information
We use your personal information that we collect to conduct our business and to provide you with the best possible products and services.
To best serve you, we may share your personally identifiable information with other members of the Nordstrom family of companies and with service providers that provide support services to us or that help us market our products and services.

Cookies and Web Beacons
Our website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology.
We use cookies and web beacons to distinguish you from other visitors, track your IP address and usage of our site, and to identify the name of the Web site from which you linked to Nordstrom.com.
This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions.
We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.
==========
Non-personally identifiable information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf.
A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website.
A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser).
A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available.
A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.
==========
When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie.
This cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your email address.
Your email address is only saved in your cookie if you register with us.
A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.
==========
If you register with us, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with access to your account information.
If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website.
If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you.
You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website.
In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.
