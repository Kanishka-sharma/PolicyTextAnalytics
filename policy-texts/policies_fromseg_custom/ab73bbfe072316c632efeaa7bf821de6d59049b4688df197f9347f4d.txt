Cookies, and non-personal information YouGov collects

Like most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information only in aggregate to analyse trends, and to administer and track usage of the site.

YouGov also uses cookies and web beacons.
Cookies are small files downloaded on to your computer when you visit a website.
Web beacons are transparent images that can track when a computer visits a particular website.
Cookies and web beacons allow us to do lots of things to deliver and improve our services: they allow us to see how many people are using our websites and opening our emails and to determine for what purposes these actions are being taken.
They also allow us to facilitate a user's log-in and monitor web usage to inform research on internet habits (in general, not on an individual level) and are used as navigation aids and as session timers.
YouGov also works with advertisers to recruit people to the YouGov panel, each of whom provide information on how to opt out of cookies.
Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies and web beacons in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
If you do disable them, you may not be able to access certain features of our website or use some of our services.
We use the information we collect from you exclusively for research purposes and the administration of your YouGov account.
Your individual responses to questions will be used only for statistical analyses, without your name or other personally identifying information being disclosed.
