C. Process MLB will use to Verify Request to Disclose or Delete California Resident’s Personal Information
A request to disclose or delete your information must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, a resident of California and it must describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
D. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information
You have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time.
==========
E. Your Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights
We will not deny services, charge different prices, offer a different quality of service or otherwise discriminate against you for exercising these rights.
Nothing in this section prohibits MLB from charging you a different price or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to you by the use of your data.
With your consent, MLB may choose to offer you financial incentives directly related to the value of your personal information for the collection, sale, or deletion of your personal information.
You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
If you choose to do so, MLB may require you to (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so and (2) verify your own identity and residency directly.
MLB may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on their behalf.
