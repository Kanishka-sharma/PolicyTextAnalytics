Adelphic Inc. (“Adelphic”) is a mobile and cross-channel programmatic advertising platform that helps brands meaningfully connect and engage with the right audiences.
This Privacy Policy describes Adelphic’s practices and policies for information we collect through our website located at www.adelphic.com (collectively with any other websites owned by Adelphic, the “Sites”) and through Adelphic’s advertising platform (the “Adelphic Service”).
By partnering with us as a publisher, advertising through the Adelphic Service, or visiting the Sites and/or otherwise using the Adelphic Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
Personal Information That You Give Us
We generally do not collect or use personal information about individual consumers through the Adelphic Service.
When we say “personal information,” we mean individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of and directly contact a specific living person.
==========
We collect personal information only when we are contacted directly by an individual through the Sites or the Adelphic Service and the individual voluntarily provides personal information to us, such as by submitting a question or registering to use the Adelphic Service.
Adelphic does not collect personal information about consumers that receive advertiser offers through the Adelphic Service.
To the extent we receive it, we use personal information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected, such as to respond to such communications, to complete registration for the Adelphic Service, or to use the Adelphic Service.
==========
We take reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information is relevant to and reliable for its intended use.
By voluntarily providing us with personal information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We do not share this personal information with any third parties.
==========
Information We Collect Automatically
When you interact with Adelphic through the Adelphic Service or Sites, we may collect device usage information (including your IP address) or behavioral information.
This data, which is collected passively using various technologies, does not specifically identify you personally and may come from such sources as your web browser or the apps that you use.
We use this behavioral information along with our technology to perform a variety of tasks, such as limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same user (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of users, or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked.
We may share this behavioral information with clients, vendors, and other companies that we conduct business with.
==========
Cookies and Similar Technology
In operating the Adelphic Service and Sites, we may use a technology called “cookies,” which are small text files that our Sites serve to your browser when you access the Sites.
Our cookies may collect and store behavioral information, help provide additional functionality to the Adelphic Service and Sites, and help us analyze usage more accurately.
In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect personal information except with your permission.

Behavioral Information
Adelphic uses the behavioral information we collect to create micro-audience segments that make advertising delivered to consumers more relevant.
==========
The segments we create are used by us, our clients and partners, including advertisers and publishers, to deliver targeted advertising.
In the process of serving an advertisement to a device, we, or our partners, may decide to serve an ad based on the behavioral information associated with that device, and the audience segment we believe may be associated with that device.
The data we collect is also used for reporting purposes, to give our clients more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns, and to improve performance over time.
Opt Out Process
Adelphic participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self Regulatory Program for Interest Based Advertising.
If you wish to opt out of advertising based upon your interests, you can opt out for web advertising at the DAA’s site (aboutads.info), or you can opt out for both web and mobile app advertising at our web site (click here).

Information Sharing
With our Clients and Business Partners.
The Adelphic Service is used by advertisers, publishers and other companies providing advertising services.
We may share anonymized, aggregated behavioral information and audience segments with these clients to enable them to deliver targeted advertising.
This information does not personally identify any individual person.
==========
If we share information with such third parties, we require them to follow privacy and data security principles and practices that are substantially similar to ours.
