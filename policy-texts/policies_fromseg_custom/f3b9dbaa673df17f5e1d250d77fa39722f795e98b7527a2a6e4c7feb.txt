==========
What is local storage?

While this is similar to cookies, local storage can take larger amounts of data and this data is not automatically transferred with each request to the site that stored it.
==========

Check your browser’s „Help“ files to learn more about handling local storage.
==========
What is the Mobile Advertising ID?
The Mobile Advertising ID is a online identifier of a mobile device that you can manually reset.
It allows the recognition of recurring devices by mobile apps, typically for advertising purposes.
On Android devices, the Mobile Advertising ID is known as the „Android Advertising ID“, on Apple devices as the „ID for advertiser (IDFA)“.
The Mobile Advertising ID applies to a device and is accessible by apps that you use.
It is not used by websites you visit.

How does SENSIC.net use cookies, local storage and the Mobile Advertising ID?
==========
(a) Data collection among general internet and mobile app audience



              We may set cookies in your browser when you see certain advertisements whose effectiveness we study on behalf of our customers when you visit websites that display such advertisements.
Each of these cookies has a name that consists of letters and numbers and includes, in an encoded form, a randomly generated unique identification number, information that identifies the respective advertising campaign, creative and placement and the date and time when the advertisement was displayed and how often.
==========
As we set the cookies, we log on our servers the same information that we store in the cookies.
These cookies expire after two years, at the latest, unless you delete them manually.
==========
When you play streaming media content or view other content that is accessible to a broad audience on websites that you visit or in mobile apps that you use we may do one of the following:
            


• store a randomly generated unique identifier in your browser’s local storage


• or capture the Mobile Advertising ID.
With streaming media measurement, together with the Mobile Advertising ID or unique identifier stored in Local Storage, we record for how long the streaming content is played and when it is stopped and paused and when you rewind and fast-forward.
When we set cookies, store data in your browser’s local storage, capture your Mobile Advertising ID or measure streaming content usage in online media players, we store anonymized IP addresses and referrer URLs (internet addresses of websites).
We anonymize these data by removing the last octet of each IP address and by truncating referrer URLs behind the top-level domain (like „.com“, „.
co.uk“ or „.
de“).
==========
Before we store anonymized IP addresses, we use them to determine which country and region or city you are using the service from.
We process personal data that we collect through cookies and similar technologies among general internet and app audience for purposes of our legitimate interest pursuant to art. 6 (1) lit.
f of the European General Data Protection Regulation.

This cookie or Local Storage information includes your panelist identification number and the information when it was stored and last updated.
