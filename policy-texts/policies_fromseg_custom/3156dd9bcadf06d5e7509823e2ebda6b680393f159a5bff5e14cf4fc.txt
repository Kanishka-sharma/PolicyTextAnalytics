In order for us to provide this feature, we will keep copies of your emailed messages.
We may decide, but are not obligated to, monitor your email messages through computer software or human personnel to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive language, as well as for content that may infringe our rights or the rights of others, all of which we may remove at any time in our sole discretion.
Ordinarily, we will not otherwise access your emailed messages except in unusual cases, including but not limited to times when we receive specific complaints related to a particular emailed message or are compelled to do so by law.
For administrative purposes we intend to keep an email log that includes a record of which registered users and subscribers sent email messages and to which email addresses they were sent.
We will use the addressee information you enter only to send the emails you request.
==========
Station Sharing: We also offer Site-wide community features designed to help other registered users and subscribers find music they like, by making available a registered user's or subscriber's station either in an anonymous form or to registered users or subscribers who know your email address and specifically request your station by entering your email address in the applicable field on our Site.
Registered users and subscribers may also access features such as message boards that allow other registered users and subscribers to communicate with each other.
Any information that you send or post via our Site's community features will be considered public information and we cannot be held responsible for any information you choose to make public.

Personal Pages: Each registered user or subscriber may have the opportunity to post favorite songs, stations or other information on personal pages.
These personal pages may be made available to other registered users and subscribers as part of the Service.
The information you post to such personal pages, therefore, may be viewed by visitors to such pages.
==========
Your personal page will be identified to others by the local-part of the email address you provide to us (i.e., the part of your email address before the "@" sign) either alone or in combination with additional numbers or letters.
Thus, to the extent your email address includes personal information (such as your full name), this information may be displayed to other registered users and subscribers.

==========
We are not, however, responsible for any other Web sites, or their respective privacy policies or how they treat information about their members.
We strongly advise you to check their privacy policies to find out how they are treating your personal information.
Third Party Usage: You may also separately share your information with other Web sites or entities, such as those that create professional marketing lists, to receive special offers and promotions from their affiliates.
These Web sites or entities may agree to share your information with us.
Whether or not any third party actually shares your information with us and to what extent they do share your information with us will depend on their agreement with us and their respective privacy policies.
PM is not responsible for, and will assume no liability, if a Partner or other Web site or entity collects, uses or shares, any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy, or applicable law.

Marketing Data: We may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested.
We may also associate this marketing data to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.
Automatic Data Collection 
Copyright Tracking: In an effort to optimize our Site, Service and user experience, we may, from time to time, provide automatic updates, fixes or support, as we deem appropriate.
PM uses software that is designed to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to.
In order to make sure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties, this software identifies and counts the songs you have accessed.

We may use your personal usage data for a variety of Service-related purposes including, without limitation, for displaying advertising to users of the free ad-supported version of the Service.
==========
Partner Access: When you access the Service through a Partner, we may add select aspects of your registration information (such as your email address and, if applicable, the Partner or promotion through which you registered) to the registry settings on your computer's hard drive, so that we can recognize which of our Partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on to the Service.
Cookies: We use what are commonly called cookies when you use our Service.
We use these cookies to identify you as a valid registered user or subscriber so that we can deliver music to you, to ensure that no one else can sign on simultaneously with your account from another computer and to help us serve you better based on your registration preferences (such as your preferences with regard to what types of music you would like to receive).
We may also use cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide as well as the delivery of advertising to users of the free version of the Service.
In addition, we may also use cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to save your email address and password each subsequent time you sign in and to track your use of free trial features.
==========
Advertiser Cookies: We also use a third party advertising company, DoubleClick, to deliver ads to you when you visit our Site.
In the course of providing this service, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser which collects information about your visits to our Site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information).
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third party advertising company, please click here: http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.
Performance tracking: We sometimes use cookies, as well as tracking technology, such as web beacons, within the promotional emails that we send to our registered user and subscribers or advertisements for our Site.
These performance tracking devices help us to track whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a free trial for example.
==========
Such information is non-personally identifying and collected on an aggregate level.
We sometimes utilize third-party service providers to help us track the activity within our Site.
These third parties may use temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking, but the data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way.
Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Site may also use cookies, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices.
Other types of information collected:
In order to better improve our Service, we capture other data such as a registered user's or subscriber's search criteria and results, date, time, connection speed and the IP address of each registered Service user, subscriber and Site visitor.

Partners: If you access the Service through a Partner, we may share your registration information (such as your email address, year of birth, zip code and gender) with our Partner that you registered with for our Service.
Vendors: We will share your personal information with companies acting as our agents in providing our service (e.g., credit card processing, customer/support services) to you, all of whom agree to use it only for such specified purposes.
Each vendor must also agree to keep your personal information reasonably secure and confidential in accordance with applicable laws.

In the event of such a transfer, PM will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our Site for 30 days of any such change in ownership of PM resulting in a change of control of your personal information.
Legally compelled disclosure: We will also disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (whether intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property.
