We use reasonable industry standard technology to keep information that you submit to us secure.
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Use of Third Party Opt-in Lists
With respect to EQ Works’s use of third party opt-in lists, EQ Works may enter into co-branding arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in question may be present for contact from these organizations as well.
The opt-in features are specific to each organization, but you should never receive e-mail from these organizations unless you have indicated that it is acceptable.
All e-mail from EQ Works, or from co-brand partners who gain your permission to send you commercial e-mail, will include an opportunity to opt-out of future communications.
