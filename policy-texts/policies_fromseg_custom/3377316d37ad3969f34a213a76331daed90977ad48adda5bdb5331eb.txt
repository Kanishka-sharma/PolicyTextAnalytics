A.) About our partnership with INFOnline GmbHOur websites use the measurement procedure known as "next-generation innovative scalable central measurement process," or SZMnG, from INFOnline GmbH for calculating key statistical figures on the usage of our products and services.
The goal of usage measurement is to statistically determine the number of visits to our websites, the number of website visitors and their surfing behavior – on the basis of a uniform standard procedure – and so obtain values that are comparable across the market.
==========
For all digital products and services that are members of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. (IVW; German Audit Bureau of Circulation) or take part in studies of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. (AGOF; Working Group for Online Media Research), usage statistics on reach are regularly processed further by AGOF and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. (agma; Media Analysis Working Group) and published with the performance value "unique user" as well as the performance values "page impression" and "visits" from IVW.
These reach values and statistics can be seen on the respective websites.1.
Legal basis for processingMeasurement using INFOnline GmbH's SZMnG process is carried out on the basis of legitimate interest as defined by Art. 6, Par.
==========
1, lit.
f of the GDPR.
The purpose of processing personal data is the generation of statistics and the creation of user categories.
==========
The statistics help us understand and verify the usage of products and services.
The user categories form the basis for the provision of advertising material and/or advertising measures aligned with your interests.
==========
For the marketing of our website, usage measurement that guarantees comparability with other market participants is essential.
Our legitimate interest arises from the economic usability of the findings generated by statistics and user categories and the market value of our website – including direct comparison with the websites of third parties – which can be determined using statistics.
==========
Moreover, we have a legitimate interest in making available the pseudonymized data from INFOnline, AGOF, agma and IVW for the purposes of market research (AGOF, agma) and for statistical purposes (INFOnline, IVW).
Moreover, we have a legitimate interest in making available the pseudonymized data from INFOnline for further development and provision of advertising materials aligned with interests.2.
Type of dataINFOnline GmbH collects the following data which, according to the GDPR, may contain references to individuals:IP address: Every device on the internet requires a unique address for the transfer of data – the IP address.
==========
Due to the way the internet works, it is a technical requirement that the IP address be stored at least in the short term.
IP addresses are reduced by 1 byte before any processing and all further processing takes place anonymously.
==========
There is no saving or further processing of non-truncated IP addresses.A randomly generated client identifier: To identify computer systems, reach processing uses either a third-party cookie, a first-party cookie, a "local storage object" or a signature generated from a range of information automatically transferred by your browser.
This identifier can uniquely identify a browser as long as the cookie or local storage object is not deleted.
Measurement of data and subsequent allocation to the relevant client identifier is therefore also possible if you access other websites that use INFOnline GmbH's measurement process ("SZMnG").
The validity of cookies is restricted to a maximum of one year.3.
Usage of dataINFOnline GmbH's measurement process, which is used on this website, communicates usage data.
==========
This occurs for the collection of the performance values "page impressions," "visits" and "clients" and to generate other key figures from them (e.g., qualified clients).
Moreover, we may use the measurement data as follows:"Geo-localization," which links website access to the location from which it was accessed, occurs solely on the basis of the anonymized IP address and only to the geographical level of state/region.
Under no circumstances can the geographic information gathered in this way be used to identify the precise whereabouts of a specific user.The usage data of a technical client (e.g., a browser on a device) is compiled across websites and stored in a database.
==========
This information is used for technical estimation of the demographic details of age and gender and transferred to the AGOF service provider for further reach processing.
As part of the AGOF study, a random sample of social characteristics is used to provide a technical estimate that allows assignment to the following categories: age, gender, nationality, profession, marital status, general household details, household income, place of residence, internet usage, online interests, usage location, user type.4.
==========
Storage duration of the dataINFOnline GmbH does not store the complete IP address.
The truncated IP address is stored for a maximum of 60 days.
The usage data in connection with the unique identifier is stored for a maximum of six months.5.
Transfer of dataNeither the IP address nor the truncated IP address is transferred.
In generating the AGOF study, data is transferred to the following AGOF service providers with client identifiers:Kantar Deutschland GmbHAnkordata GmbH & Co.
KGInterrogare GmbH6.

Rights of data subjectsData subjects have the following rights:Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR )Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR )Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 et seq.
GDPR)Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR )For any inquiries related to these rights, please contact datenschutz@spiegelgruppe.de.
==========
Please note that for this type of inquiry, we must be able to establish that we are dealing with the data subject.
The data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authorities.
You can find further information on the measurement process on the website of INFOnline GmbH, which operates the measurement process, the data protection website of AGOF and the data protection website of IVW.B.)
About our partnership with IP Deutschland GmbH1).
The following general information applies:Various companies are involved in the marketing of our internet products and services, both in the collection of data and in the serving of advertising.
These companies play different roles.
==========
In some cases, they are individually responsible for data processing (controller) or act purely as a service provider carrying out the instructions of a controller (processor).
In the context of advertising marketing, IP Deutschland GmbH, Picassoplatz 1, 50679 Cologne, Germany, email: kontakt@ip.de, is responsible and are thus, together with us, "joint controllers" under Article 26 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation in terms of our internet products and services.
You can find more details about this, about roles and about other responsible parties here.2.
==========
Collection of data in the context of marketing (tracking, profiling, etc.)In order to personalize advertising, design it according to interests and find suitable target groups, to collect information for billing, measure reach and control/limit the serving of ads through frequency capping, a system is used in online advertising that examines user behavior and produces pseudonymized profiles of users, which can then be used in the serving of advertising.
As part of that process, products and services that have been visited, content that has been clicked on, etc., are captured and stored.
==========
This data is stored within a profile in a database that can be accessed with a cookie or by another means of identification.
Names and personal data of users are not stored.
The cookie is essentially a pseudonym and does not contain the real name or identity of the user.
==========
In some cases, data from other sources, e.g., parts of profiles from registered areas or also technical data about the device used, the time the activity occurred or data from party sources can also be stored.
Behavior patterns of users of our products and services are stored and analyzed within the profile and it is in part supplemented by sociodemographic data or assumptions about sociodemographic data (so-called statistical twins of profiles with known data that are compared based on similar or identical surfing behavior).
The formation of this profile is also possible across networks, i.e., across a number of internet products or services.3.
Legal basisBoth the operators of the products and services and the other marketers and other entities that serve advertising on the products and services have a legitimate interest in marketing and monetizing their (marketed) products and services through the target group-specific serving of advertising as well as measuring the reach and controlling the serving of advertising with the use of frequency capping.
The same applies to the creation of user profiles that make this possible in the first place.
==========
This purpose could not be achieved without data processing.
Given the pseudonymous nature of the data, users of the products and services will not be individually identifiable to us or our marketers beyond the recognition of the browser and end devices used.
Incursions on the user's right of informational self-determination are justified by the fact that the user's data is pseudonymized and is only used for relatively short periods of time.
Because users are informed transparently of the procedures used in data protection statements and are also provided with effective possibilities for opting out, incursions on users' rights are minimal and at the expected level.
Furthermore, no profiles are produced that focus on children.
The legal basis for all processing of data in the scope of marketing is Art. 6 1f of the GDPR ("legitimate interests") or Sec.

About our partnership with Consentric TechnologyDeutsche Post AG's Consentric process was developed from the outset against the backdrop of data protection requirements and aims to process as little personal data as possible.
With the Consentric procedure, Deutsche Post AG, with the involvement of various partners, links a cookie stored on a user's terminal device with a microcell of Deutsche Post Direkt GmbH ("DP Direkt").
==========
This microcell contains only one statement about a group - an average of 6.6 people - so that the cookie identifier (cookie ID) cannot be assigned to an individual person.
Various addresses have been combined in a microcell, so that the Consentric procedure has been used to link an end device to a microcell as a geographical location in compliance with data protection requirements.
You can object to the data processing within the scope of the described procedure under the following link: https://pixel.consentric.de/optout.
==========
You can object to the use of the cookie of the service provider intelliAd (diva-e Products GmbH, Sendlinger Str.

We are therefore jointly responsible with Deutsche Post AG for the protection of your personal data.
The joint responsibility is limited to forwarding the cookie IDs read by you on our websites to Deutsche Post AG for participation in the Consentric process (conversion to a microcell).
The individual process steps are divided as follows: We are responsible for pixelation/installation of a script on our web pages and forwarding of the intelliAd cookie along with campaign information to Deutsche Post AG.
Deutsche Post AG is responsible for the operation of the Consentric process and the specifications to us for forwarding your cookie IDs to Deutsche Post AG.
With the help of the cookies, it can be recognized that you are visiting a website participating in the measurement.
This information is then aggregated on the basis of the anonymous microcell of Deutsche Post Direkt GmbH.
==========
This means that it can no longer be assigned to you.
At no time are individual users identified by name.
Your identity therefore remains protected.
==========
Deutsche Post Direkt GmbH has data protection-compliant procedures for sending postal advertising based on the selection of a microcell.
This process of selecting a microcell is facilitated by the Consentric process, which automatically indicates which microcells are of interest to an advertising company on the basis of the upstream measurement process.
For example, calling up a web page can trigger the sending of a postal advertising letter.
