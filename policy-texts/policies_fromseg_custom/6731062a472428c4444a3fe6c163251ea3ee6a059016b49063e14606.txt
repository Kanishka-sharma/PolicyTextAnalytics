We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
When we do so, we will post the new privacy policy on this page and change the date at the top of the policy.

This site includes links to other web sites, such as the site for starbucksstore.com and Starbucks International web sites.
We provide these links as a courtesy to you and we do not have control over the operation of the sites, even though they may use the Starbucks name or logo.
In addition, you may sign up for accounts on some of these web sites.
==========
These sites have their own privacy and information security policy and terms and conditions and do not necessarily follow our Privacy Policy.
Their policies will control their collection and use of your personal information.
Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
In addition, when you browse, they may place their own cookies on your computer and we do not control cookies placed on your computer by third parties whose advertising or links appear on our site.

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that this Site is hosted on our computer servers in the United States.
Any personal information collected through this Site may be transferred to the United States and other countries that might not provide an equivalent level of protection as the data protection laws in your home country.
Your use of this Site or submission of any personal information will therefore constitute your consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of your home country.
==========
In addition, where appropriate, specific authorizations or consents may be obtained from time to time.
For example, we may seek consent to use and share personal information after it has been collected in those cases where Starbucks wishes to use the information for a purpose not previously identified or for which the individual concerned has not previously provided consent.
In most cases, and subject to legal and contractual restrictions, an individual is free to refuse or withdraw his or her consent at any time upon reasonable, advance notice.
==========
It should be noted that in some circumstances, certain Starbucks products and services can only be offered if a person provides personal information to Starbucks.
