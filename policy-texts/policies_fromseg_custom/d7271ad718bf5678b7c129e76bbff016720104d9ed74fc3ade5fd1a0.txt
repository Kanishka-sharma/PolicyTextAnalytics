What Information Does The Motley Fool Gather About You?
The Motley Fool collects a limited amount of information about our readers, so that we can provide a site that is more interesting and useful, as well as provide advertising that is more appropriate for our readers.
==========
We ask for your name, email address, and other personal information when you register to use our message boards, portfolios, or (eventually) chat areas, or if you sign up for any special or personalized service such as a subscription service.
We also may ask for such information at other times, such as whenever you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by The Motley Fool and/or our partners.
Sometimes we conduct surveys, too, although you don't have to respond to them.
==========
If you use our recommendation service to email one of our articles to a friend, you will need to provide us with your friend's email address.
The Motley Fool will automatically send this person a one-time email, attaching the recommended article as well as invite them to visit and register with our site.
We will not use these email addresses for any other purpose.
We also collect IP addresses to help us understand how our audience uses our site, so that we can make our site better and improve our users' overall experience when they visit The Motley Fool.
==========
For these same reasons, if your browser is set up to accept them, we use a feature known as a "cookie."
Cookies contain bits of information that Web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.
Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site such as ours.
Although we may assign your browser a cookie, it doesn't tell us who you are.
Only you can do that.
==========
How Does The Motley Fool Use Your Personal Information?
The Motley Fool collects personal information to provide you, the user, with the best and most personalized Web experience possible and to provide our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience.
In short, by knowing a little about you, The Motley Fool can deliver more relevant content and advertisements to you while at our Web site.
And it's free.
The Motley Fool conducts research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information you provide us when you register, participate in a contest or other promotion on our site, or from our server log files.
==========
This research is compiled and analyzed only on an aggregated basis.
We do this to better understand our users and improve your overall experience when using our service.
We may also notify you of a new product or new area of our site that we think may interest you based on the information you have provided us.
==========
If you'd prefer us not to contact you, simply go to our never mail page and let us know.
Sometimes we ask for personal information when providing special, personalized service.
If you don't want to give us that information, you certainly don't have to, but you may not be able to take advantage of certain products or services.
For example, we can't track your personal stock portfolio unless you input the stocks you own.
==========
What Personal Information Does FoolMart Gather About You And How Is It Used?
When you place an order with FoolMart, we need to know your name, mail and billing addresses, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date.
==========
This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
When you purchase a FoolMart email gift certificate, we also ask for the email address of the recipient in order to complete the purchase and send this person their certificate.
We'll also use your information to contact you regarding your order should the need arise.
==========
All of this information is encrypted, using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology.
If you prefer not to order online, you may also fax or mail your order form along with a check and money order made payable to FoolMart.
If you wish to order online the books that are not published by The Motley Fool, those orders are filled by Amazon (www.amazon.com), which has its own privacy and data collection practices.
FoolMart does not collect, see or have access to any personal information you may provide to Amazon when purchasing these books.
FoolMart collects your email address when you submit a customer review or Fool ballcap story.
==========
Your address will not be displayed with your submission unless you specifically ask us to.
In addition to processing your order, FoolMart uses the information we collect from you to provide you with an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience.
We'll also send you via email occasional discount alerts and notices about products we think may interest you.
==========
The Motley Fool and FoolMart collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and for studying how people use our site and how we can improve it.
Cookies are used on The Motley Fool in three main ways:

We use cookies to automatically access your previously stored account information when you log in to our site in order to deliver a better and more personalized service.
==========
Cookies are used to estimate our audience size and usage patterns.
Each browser accessing The Motley Fool is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine usage patterns, and to help in targeting content and ads based on user interests.
Advertising networks that serve ads onto our site may also use cookies but please note that we don't control, nor have access to those cookies.
On FoolMart, cookies are used in the following ways:

When you shop FoolMart, cookies help us keep track of your shopping cart and process your orders.
We use cookies to allow you to automatically access your account information, as well as make changes to your personal information.
==========
Cookies are used to determine usage patterns as well as to help in targeting promotions based on your interest and activity on FoolMart.
The FoolMart search engine uses cookies to expedite your search for a product.
==========
Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you when you've received one.
If you reject cookies, though, you will not be able to use many features of our sites including viewing or posting on our discussion boards, creating and customizing your portfolio, or your FoolMart shopping cart.
Even if you accept our cookies, unless you first tell us, we can't use them to find out who you really are and even then, it won't tell us what you're thinking, or to whom you're writing love letters.
==========
Will The Motley Fool Disclose Any of Your Personal Information?
The Motley Fool will not disclose any information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of The Motley Fool.
We do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, only aggregate information.
==========
For example, we might tell advertisers that there are 120,000 Registered Fools in Metropolis, but we won't tell them that Superman is one of them, and we won't tell them that his email address is ckent@dailyplanet.com.
We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want.
Advertisers may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males in the 22314 zip code).
==========
The Motley Fool would then take the ad and display it to users who've told us they meet those criteria.
In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information.
Only The Motley Fool has access to individuals' accounts.
We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, 35 million of our readers clicked on a message board advertisement last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
==========
If you use our recommendation service to email one of our articles to a friend, The Motley Fool will automatically send this person a one-time email, attaching the recommended article.
Your email address will appear on the "From" line of this email, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the email.
==========
We may disclose personal information in some limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a sweepstakes or some new service.
For example, if we're going to give personal information to the sponsor of a contest, we'll tell you that before you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether or not to enter.
==========
Will FoolMart Disclose Any of Your Personal Information?
FoolMart will disclose your personal information only to the extent necessary to fulfill your order and charge your credit card.
We use a fulfillment company to fill and ship your order (excluding the products that you download directly from our site) and a credit card processing company to verify your card number and process the transaction.
For example, if you ordered a Fool cap with your credit card, we'll need to give your address to the fulfillment house in order to ship the cap to you and your credit card information to the processing company to confirm payment.
==========
We employ contractors to help with our operations.
Some or all of these contractors may access the databases of user information.
These contractors are subject to confidentiality agreements which restrict their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through their relationship with FoolMart.
==========
As we are one big happy family, we may share our customers' email addresses with our parent, The Motley Fool, in order to notify you of future products and services that may be of interest to you.
Except as described in this Privacy Statement, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of FoolMart, we will not disclose any personal identifiable information about our customers.
==========
What Kind of Security Measures Do We Take to Protect Your Information from Accidental Loss or Disclosure?
The Motley Fool and FoolMart are committed to protecting your personal information.
All information that you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.
Further, the information you provide when making a purchase on FoolMart is encrypted with SSL technology.
Personalized areas of our sites, such as My Fool or your FoolMart account information are password-protected.
Only you have access to these password-protected areas.
==========
We recommend that you do not share your passwords with anyone.
The Motley Fool and FoolMart will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.

==========
Will The Motley Fool or FoolMart Use Your Information for Direct Mailings?
If you register with The Motley Fool or FoolMart or sign up for any our personalized services, we will email you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may interest you.

Changes to this Privacy Statement
The Fool may make changes to this Privacy Statement at any time, but we'll notify you of any substantive or material change (by way of email) and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out.
What Else Should You Know About Your Privacy?
==========
The information you post on message boards, in chat rooms, and in such features as your Personal Profile or your Foolish Interview is visible to the public.
That's really the point of the profile, boards, chats, and interviews.
Please remember that whenever you disclose personal information publicly - for example, on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
If you don't want strangers to send you email, don't post your email address on a message board.
Furthermore, while we do our best to protect your personal information, neither The Motley Fool or FoolMart can ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
==========
What does all this mean?
Just as in the investing world, you must protect yourself.
==========
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
==========
Many of our advertisers or partners, such as brokerages, merchants, or data providers link from our site to areas on their own sites where they sell their own goods and services.
If you follow these links from our site to theirs, you should be aware that these other sites have their privacy and data collection practices.
==========
The Motley Fool has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies.
For more information regarding a site and its privacy policies, check that site.
==========
Please note: once an account is created, we will send you a confirmation email acknowledging your new account to the address that you supplied us.
This email will give you the option to delete your account, in case you change your mind or in case you were not the one who created it in the first place.
You should keep the confirmation email, as it will also contain information that will help you use our service.
