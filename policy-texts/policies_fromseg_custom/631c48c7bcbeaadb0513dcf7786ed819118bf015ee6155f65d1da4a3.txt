==========
You are not legally required to provide Parallels with the Personal Data described in this Privacy Statement.
Further, the contractual relationship that you might have entered into with us by purchasing our Products does not imply any obligation to provide your Personal Data.
However, you might not be able to use our Products to the full extent, or in some cases you may not be able to use our Products at all, if you do not provide us with certain data or object to the use of this data.
Our Legal Basis for Processing
When processing your Personal Data, we rely on the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), an EU-wide legal framework for the standardization of data protection.
==========
Parallels primarily processes data as a controller, for the purposes explained above under Sections 1 and 2 of this Privacy Statement.
These purposes represent our legitimate interests for the purposes of Article 6 (1) f) GDPR.
==========
At the same time, some of the Personal Data we process is necessary for us to perform a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
For example, if you express your interest in purchasing one of our Products, such as by filling out a webform, we will process the Personal Data submitted to comply with your request.
This may include sharing your Personal Data with one of our authorized resellers, who will then use your Personal Data to complete the purchase transaction.
In addition, we are legally obliged to provide certain information to criminal prosecution or tax authorities in individual cases upon request.
==========
In these cases, the legal basis for the processing is either legal requirements (Article 6 (1) c) GDPR) or reasons of public interest (Article 6 (1) e) GDPR).
Where we process your Personal Data with your explicit consent, pursuant to Article 6 (1) a) GDPR, this declaration of consent will be the legal basis for processing your Personal Data.
==========
Transferring your Data outside the EU or the EEA
Parallels’ principal place of business is in United States, which is a "Third Country" under the GDPR.
Third Countries are generally not considered to afford the same level of protection that you enjoy in the EU, but Parallels still provides an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data - decision 2002/2/EC of the EU Commission states that USA is deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection regarding commercial organizations such as Parallels.
We have ensured that our service providers and affiliates have either certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and will process all Personal Data received from EU member states in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework or that they have been subjected to strict contractual provisions in their contract with us to guarantee that an adequate level of data protection for your data is guaranteed.
==========
User Profiles
We use your data for "Profiling".
This means that we use your data to make tailored offers based on your previous behavior as well as to serve you personalized ads.
==========
However, we will never process and analyze your Personal Data in the context of Profiling in a way would lead to an automated decision that has a legal effect on you or significantly impairs you in a similar way.
Your rights regarding the processing of your Personal Data
As a natural person, you have certain rights as "Data Subject".
==========
You can assert the following rights against us under the GDPR:
Your right to information and access under Article 15 GDPR, Your right to rectification under Article 16 GDPR, Your right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR, Your right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR, and Your right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR.
In addition, you have a right of objection to the competent data protection supervisory authority under Article 77 GDPR, but only with respect to the data processing we conduct on our own behalf, as a controller.
In the event Parallels acts as a processor of your data for a third party, you must refer to the entity acting as controller to assert this right.
==========
Please note that, where you have granted us your consent to process certain Personal Data, you are free to withdraw this declaration of consent with future effect at any point in time.
This also applies to the withdrawal of declarations of consent issued to us prior to the validity of the GDPR.
==========
Information about your Right of Objection under Article 21 GDPR
1.
Right of objection in individual cases
In addition to the rights already mentioned, you have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of Personal Data relating to you, which is processed on the basis of Article 6 (1) e) GDPR (data processing in the public interest) and Article 6 (1) f) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Article 4 (4) GDPR.
==========
If you file an objection, we will no longer process your Personal Data unless we can prove compelling grounds for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.
Please also note that, if we terminate the processing due to your objection, the Sites or Products may no longer be available to you or only to a limited extent.
2.
==========
The right to object to the processing of data for advertising purposes
You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of direct marketing, including any subscription to our newsletters or personalized ads; this also applies to Profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing.
If you object, we will no longer process your Personal Data in the future.
