What do you do to keep my data secure?
We use in-transit (TLS) and at-rest (AES) encryption, access controls (including two-factor), and data security policies to protect your passwords, credit card numbers and email lists.
We have a defense-in-depth approach to security, with layered next-generation firewalls, network-based intrusion prevention/detection, DDOS mitigation, vulnerability assessments (internal and 3rd party) and state-of-the-art data centers covered by 24X7 guards and biometrics.
In other words, we take securing your data seriously.
==========
What about security in your applications?
Our goal is to design, build, and maintain secure applications.
We believe security should be built in and not bolted on.
We regularly review our code as well as any third party code included in our products using static and dynamic analysis tools along with manual code reviews in critical areas.
We train our engineers in secure coding and architectural design patterns like the ones outlined in the OWASP Top 10, SANS critical security controls, and the NIST frameworks
If you find an issue with our products, head over to the vulnerability reporting page and let us know.

What do you do to protect my data from loss?
