==========
List Prices
The list prices displayed on the Websites come from bibliographic information we receive from leading third-party sources and publishers.
Each list price is the publisher's suggested retail price.
Chegg is not responsible for errors in that third-party data.
If a title does not have a publisher's suggested list price, the Websites may not show a list price in the online catalog.
==========
If a product is listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error or an error in pricing information received from our suppliers, Chegg shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order, whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit or debit card charged.
If your credit or debit card has already been charged and your order is canceled, Chegg will issue a credit to your credit or debit card account.
Service Modifications
Chegg reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes to the Websites and the Services at any time.
Any description of the Services provided by Chegg is not a representation that the Services are working or will always work in that manner, as Chegg is continuously updating the Websites and the Services, and these updates may not always be reflected in the Terms of Use.
Mobile Use
You may access the Websites and use the Services through mobile devices in accordance with Chegg's instructions.
By downloading the software required to facilitate your use of the Websites or the Services, you accept the terms of the End User License Agreement provided with the software at the time of download or installation, as well as any updates.
Certain features of the Websites and/or the Services may not be available through a mobile device.
In addition, by accessing the Services through a mobile device, you agree that information about your use of the Website and Services through your mobile device may be communicated to Chegg, including without limitation your mobile device ID, your mobile carrier, and your physical location.
Use of the Services through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and through your mobile device which may be viewed by your mobile carrier or other access provider.
==========
You may also opt to receive text message reminders from Chegg, as a courtesy to you.
Please review our text message mobile disclosures, which are incorporated into the Terms of Use and may be updated by Chegg from time to time without notice.
You are still responsible for compliance with the Terms of Use, including, e.g., timely return of your books, whether or not you receive such reminders.
==========

Please also be aware your mobile access provider's usual fees and charges will apply to your use of the Websites and Services, including any text messages you opt-in to receive from Chegg, and you are responsible for those fees and charges.
If you change or terminate your mobile account, you are responsible for promptly updating your Chegg account information so that any messages or notices from Chegg regarding the Services are sent to you and not to the person who is assigned your old number.
Email and Text Messages
Notifications or receipts from Chegg will be delivered to you by email at the address you provided to Chegg when you created your account or as later updated.
You hereby agree and acknowledge that Chegg is not responsible to notify you in any way other than by email, even if you opt-in to receive text message reminders.
==========
Any such text notifications are a courtesy; you remain responsible for minding the due date(s) and other deadlines whether you receive communication from Chegg or not.
Chegg will not ask you for your personal information, account username, and password, or any of your credit or debit card information via email or text message.
Chegg will have no responsibility for any misuse of such information if you provide such information via email or text message.
==========
Account Cancellation
You may cancel your account at any time throughout our Websites.
Your account will only be cancelled and closed after you have returned all books that have been rented to you (if any) and all transactions have been processed including payment of assessed penalties or the cashing of any refund check.
Chegg may cancel your account in its sole discretion any reason, including but not limited to inactivity or misuse.
==========
Credit/Debit Card Processing & Payments
Chegg may require users of some Websites or Services to provide a valid credit or debit card tied to an account at a financial institution when they register for an account (to ensure users are able to make applicable payments to Chegg) or upon ordering products or services.
If a payment card is required, you are responsible for ensuring that a valid credit or debit card is associated with your Chegg account at all times (either the original card or a replacement).
To confirm your card is valid, Chegg may initiate a "pending" charge for one dollar (US $1.00) on the account.
==========
This charge will not be confirmed and, therefore, you will not be charged and it will simply disappear from your financial statement (usually within seven days – check with your financial institution for additional information).
Please be aware that this $1.00 pending charge may be initiated each time you edit the card information for your account or place an order that cannot be processed.
Where your billing address is requested, you must provide the address and phone number your financial institution has on record, as well as the card's CVV (card security code).
==========
Chegg will make reasonable efforts to process your transactions in a timely manner, but we make no guarantees regarding the processing time for charges.
Chegg will store your credit or debit card information, encrypted, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that Chegg may charge you for, and you will pay for, any charges specified on the Web sites and for any auto-extension or unreturned, lost, stolen, or damaged books associated with your account under the terms of your book rental.
Chegg reserves the right to place you into collections if you fail to timely pay for the products and services ordered through the Service;; collections may be done by Chegg or a third party on Chegg's behalf.
You also agree that we may, at our discretion, send your account to a collection agency, and recover our reasonable costs of collection from you, if you fail to pay all fees due and owing to Chegg.
Chegg Credit
From time to time, Chegg may issue you Chegg Credit.
Upon providing you credit, Chegg may place limits on its use.
==========
If provided to you in exchange for goods or services or as a refund, it will not expire.
If the credit was given to you with terms explicitly authorizing redemption for cash, you may convert that credit to cash.
If you receive a credit from customer support, you may not redeem it for cash.
==========
Chegg Discount Codes, Bonuses, Coupons & Other Promotions
From time to time, Chegg may offer discounts, bonuses, coupons or other promotional incentives.
These incentives typically have their own specific rules, restrictions and limitations (e.g., limiting when, how often, and under what circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion).
You are responsible for carefully reviewing and complying with these applicable rules, restrictions and limitations; certain promotions may not apply in certain jurisdictions where prohibited by law.
==========
They are generally designed to prohibit self-dealing, collusion, smurfing (defined as breaking large orders or sales transactions into multiple individual transactions for the purpose of obtaining multiple discounts or payments), or otherwise gaming or defrauding the system.
By participating in such promotions, you agree to be bound by the applicable terms and conditions, and that Chegg, in its sole discretion, may deny payment or benefits (e.g., when it believes improper activity has occurred or when a code has expired).
All promotions may expire at any time without notice to recipients.
Promotions apply only toward the actual base product/service rental or purchase cost; they do not apply to taxes, shipping, extension or late fees, or any other additional fees (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).
==========
Course Searches and Other Information Specific to an Academic Institution
We may tie your Chegg experience to information about the school you have identified to Chegg.
For certain schools, the Websites enable you to search and retrieve information about the materials required for particular courses.
Please be aware that course information and assigned materials may change from time to time, and Chegg may not receive updated information from the school in a timely manner.
Chegg is not responsible for any errors in the information provided in the course searches on the Websites.
Where specific school names or information relate to a specific school are displayed, they do not imply any endorsement or approval by the school.
Except where specifically stated, Chegg has no affiliation with or endorsement from any academic institution, and school names and information are used on the Websites only to the extent necessary to organize, identify and permit use of information and sections of the Websites that may be tailored to students of a particular school, or for other lawful uses.
==========
Return of Digital Access Codes
Through the Services, you may purchase, as a separate product, a digital access code (DAC) to certain Digital Content.
The DAC publishers allow only one user (one activation) of these codes.
Chegg will ship your ordered DAC to you in sealed packaging.
If the DAC packaging is opened, Chegg must assume that the code is activated and therefore cannot be resold.
Thus, you may not return a DAC with opened packaging for a refund.
==========
Tax
Rentals and purchases through the Services may be subject to taxes in many states because Chegg has physical property (the books or other items) in every state.
Depending on your state and the nature of the product or service you receive from us, this may be a rental tax, sales tax and/or use tax.
Tax rates are different from state to state.
You are responsible for paying all such taxes.
Supplemental Materials
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that supplemental materials (CDs and CD-ROMs, Workbooks, Study Guides) will be included with book rentals.
==========
However, they are available for purchase on select titles.
If you receive your rental book with any of the above items, you are welcome to use it.
We ask that you return your book complete with any supplemental materials you received.
==========
Asset Ownership
All rentals remain the property of Chegg even while the item is in your possession.
You may be given the option to purchase rented books from Chegg, either at the end of a rental cycle or at any point during the rental cycle.
If you wish to purchase a book you have rented through the Services, you may be able to do so by accessing your account on the Websites and looking for the purchase option.
In this case, title (ownership) transfers to you as soon as your credit or debit card is authorized for purchase value.
If you purchase the title through our purchase program, title (ownership) changes hands as soon as you receive the product.
Certain digital products may not be available for purchase or may have different purchase terms, and you should review their specific terms prior to rental or purchase.
Policies
The following policies, including all policies referenced therein, are part of this Terms of Use and provide additional terms and conditions related to specific services offered on our Websites:http://www.chegg.com/generalpolicies/.
==========
These policies may change from time to time.
Changes take effect when we post them on the site.
When using particular services on our Websites, you are subject to any posted policies or rules applicable to services you use through the sites.
All such policies or rules are hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use.
==========
Categories of Homework Help Users
You may use Chegg's homework help services, which include Cramster.com, as a "Member" or a "Visitor."
"Members" may include a variety of designated levels of members who may be charged for services according to the terms of the particular offer, or registered free members (a "Free Member"), or other membership levels.
"Visitors" are users that have not registered for an account with access to and use of certain aspects of the homework help services (e.g., certain products and services, activities and/or content and materials of Cramster.com), which may be restricted and only available to certain Members.
==========
The membership levels, the benefits and pricing of each level of membership may vary and are subject to change at any time, please read the terms of any particular level of membership carefully before accepting it.
Chegg may modify these levels and benefits from time to time, and each such modification is effective as soon as we post it on the relevant Websites except to the extent that your particular pricing structure is established in writing for a period of time in the future, such as an annual plan.
It is therefore important that you review the membership page regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes.
==========
Homework Help Usage
Chegg's homework help services are available merely as informational and study aids and should not be considered substitutes for applicable coursework, homework, class and lecture requirements, assignments and related materials.
In using the Websites, you specifically agree not to use, claim or submit as your own any portion of the homework help materials.
You further agree the Websites may present information that is incorrect or inconsistent when compared to similar content and materials, including solutions and their methodologies, provided or preferred by publishers of applicable problems or instructors of applicable courses.
==========
Homework Help Payments and Renewals
Payment for homework help services is due in advance of each applicable membership period (e.g., monthly or annually).
MONTHLY AND ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDE WILL BE CHARGED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD UNTIL YOUR MEMBERSHIP IS TERMINATED BY US OR CANCELLED BY YOU.
You may elect to temporarily "suspend" your membership, for example, during school breaks or vacation, for up to a total of 90 days in any one membership year (i.e., during each 12-month period following the commencement of your membership), and the period of your membership will be extended by the total amount of such suspended period(s).
==========
You agree to pay all applicable fees for your membership and use of the homework help services, plus any applicable taxes or other charges as may be required, when due and payable.
All fees and charges are payable in advance and non-refundable, including after cancellation.
If you wish to cancel your homework help membership, please visit the customer support web area on the Website.
Cancellation of memberships will take effect at the end of the applicable then-current billing period for which payment has been made in advance as described above.
==========
Free Trial Memberships 
We may from time to time offer free trials for some of our Services.
Such trials may require you to register with a valid credit card to commence.
Users that sign up for a free trial membership at a particular level will be automatically renewed at the promoted membership rate for that level at the end of the trial period unless the user cancels the membership at least before the end of the trial, unless the terms of the offer explicitly state otherwise.
You can cancel a free trial online or by contacting Chegg's customer support.
After cancellation of a free trial, you can continue as a Free Member with reduced benefits or access.
Only one free trial membership is allowed per person.
Subsequent registrations do not qualify for free trials.
Unless the terms of a promotion state otherwise, for promotions that include "free" periods with "paid" periods, paid periods will elapse first.
==========
We may introduce new or additional features, services or materials to the Website which may be a part of, or priced separately from, existing levels of membership at our sole discretion.
Deals and Vouchers from Third Party Merchants Through Cheggdeals.com
All Vouchers printed from Chegg Deals ("Vouchers") are promotional vouchers that may be purchased from participating Merchants ("Merchants") through the Chegg Deals site to be used in exchange for products and services.
The Merchant, not Chegg Deals, is the seller of the voucher and the products and services and is responsible for redeeming any Voucher you purchase.
When a Chegg Deal is purchased, the purchaser's credit card will be charged within 24 hours.
Sales tax will be collected, where applicable, upon redemption by Merchant.
==========
If gratuities are included in the purchase price, this will be made clear in the Offer.
If not mentioned, gratuities are not included.

Legal Disputes
If a dispute arises between you and Chegg, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.
Accordingly, you agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or arises out of the Terms of Use or the Services or your use of the Services (a "Claim") in accordance with the subsections below.
General.
You and Chegg agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration; except that either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court.
You acknowledge and agree that you and Chegg are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Further, unless both you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
==========
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Legal Disputes" section will be deemed void.
This "Legal Disputes" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.
==========
Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Section of these Terms of Use.
(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)
==========
The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
Arbitration Process.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477 and a separate form for California residents at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485.)
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
==========
Arbitration Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Chegg submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
==========
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Arbitrator's Decision.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
==========
The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of Limitation of Liability section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Chegg will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Chegg will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
==========

This "Legal Disputes" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.
