Ask Jeeves Europe Limited (referred to as "Ask Jeeves", "we", "us"), as operator of the Ask Jeeves Site, believes that online privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial and entertainment medium.
We collect personal information from you primarily to make using the Ask Jeeves services easier and more satisfying.
In registering for certain services offered by Ask Jeeves you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, postcode, age, gender and information about what you do and do not like.
We request this information from you so that we can provide you with the personalised service necessary to meet Ask Jeeves' goal of humanising the Internet.
From time to time, Ask Jeeves may introduce new products and services to its users.
Please note that to the extent that these new products and services affect our privacy practices, this policy will be updated.
==========
We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure your continuing familiarity with the most current version of our privacy statement.
You can determine when this policy was last revised by checking the "Last Revised" legend at the top of this statement.
By using the Ask Jeeves Site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this privacy statement.
If you do not agree to this privacy statement, please do not use the Ask Jeeves Site.
Ask Jeeves takes your privacy seriously and the security of your information is a priority to us.
==========
Unfortunately, no security system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result of the foregoing, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which information is transmitted between your computer and Ask Jeeves’ servers, or any information provided to us or to any third party through or in connection with the Ask Jeeves Site.
You provide all such information at your own risk.
==========
This policy is the sole authorized statement of Ask Jeeves’ practices with respect to the online collection of personally identifiable information and the usage of such information.
Any summaries of this policy generated by third party software or otherwise (for example, in connection with the "Platform for Privacy Preferences" or "P3P") shall have no legal effect, are in no way binding upon Ask Jeeves, shall not be relied upon in substitute for this policy, and neither supersede nor modify this policy.
If you have any questions in connection with this privacy statement, please contact us.

Find out what information Ask Jeeves gather
              and tracks and it is used


 


Information gathered online can generally be categorised as either anonymous or personally identifiable.
Anonymous information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual.
For example, Ask Jeeves knows how many questions are asked each day at each of its websites but does not know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of the people asking the questions.
Personally identifiable information is information from which you or another individual can be identified.
This information can include your name, e-mail, address, postcode, age, etc.
Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information.
==========
Each time a visitor comes to the Ask Jeeves Site, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising.
At the Ask Jeeves Site, we collect the visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from compaq.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to the Ask Jeeves Site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).
In addition to collecting these types of information, Ask Jeeves collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising.
We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our Site (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Ask Jeeves properties, etc.).
==========
To these ends, we may merge anonymized information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers.
When Ask Jeeves presents this information to outside companies, such as advertisers and research firms, personally identifiable information is not included in such information.
Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information.
==========
You do not have to provide personally identifiable information to use the Ask Jeeves Site.
However, particular services made available through the Site may require us to collect personally identifiable information from users.
We collect such personally identifiable information only when you affirmatively provide it to us – for example, in connection with receiving member services so that we can provide a personalized service to you, or in connection with responding to employment opportunities posted on the Site.
You may be asked to provide your contact information (including, for example) first name, surname, street address, e-mail address, telephone number) and when applicable, information concerning your areas of interest.
In addition, certain services made available through the Site may be provided by or administered by third party companies and you may be required to provide personal information to those companies to make use of their services.
You should review the privacy policies of those companies carefully to make sure you understand them prior to providing them with information.
Because you will be providing your information directly to those companies, Ask Jeeves cannot be responsible for what they do with your data, so it is up to you to ensure that you are comfortable with their privacy practices.
==========
Ask Jeeves also occasionally conducts or sponsors surveys, sweepstakes, contests or other promotions and organises other events (collectively, "Promotions").
In order to participate in such Promotions, you may be required to provide individual contact and other personal information to be used in connection with the particular Promotion.
From time to time, Ask Jeeves co-sponsors these events with other companies.
==========
By providing your personal information to us in order to participate in such Promotions, you agree that we may collect and use that information in connection with the Promotion and share such information where relevant with our co-sponsoring partners.
When appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive information from third-party organisations in connection with services or events offered by Ask Jeeves.
This option may be made available through Ask Jeeves' registration and/or through registration processes maintained by a participating third party.
In such cases, you will be informed before you register for the event or service that a third party will be receiving the registration information you provide and you will have the option not to participate in any service or event that requires third party involvement.

In addition, Ask Jeeves may share personally identifiable information with other Ask Jeeves companies and other third parties to personalize a visitor's experience with our websites and to provide the services outlined in this privacy statement.
Ask Jeeves works and may in the future work with third parties who provide services that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, website hosting, data analysis and e-mail services.
We reserve the right to share personally identifiable information with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services, and will seek to impose confidentiality and security obligations on such service providers.
==========
As noted above, Ask Jeeves may share personally identifiable information provided by you with carefully selected third parties for the purpose of administering Promotions that we may sponsor or co-sponsor from time to time.
If you contact us through the Ask Jeeves Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and reserve the right to use your e-mail address, and any other information you provide in your message, to respond to you.
In addition, from time to time we may e-mail important information regarding the use of the Ask Jeeves Site or services to visitors who have provided us with their e-mail addresses.
==========
Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to release information concerning any visitor when that visitor is in violation of our Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or is involved in or takes part (or is reasonably suspected of taking part) in any illegal activity, and to release such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required by law.
We also reserve the right to release information about our visitors when we believe in good faith that such release is required to protect the rights, property, safety or security of Ask Jeeves, our visitors or the public, or to respond to an emergency.
Ask Jeeves reserves the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from visitors, or that we otherwise collect concerning the Ask Jeeves Sites, to a third party in the event of a sale or transfer of assets or of any portion of our business.
Some transfers of personally identifiable information that we make may be to service providers and other companies located in jurisdictions which do not necessarily have data protection laws that offer the same level of protection to individuals as the laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which you may be located.
However, Ask Jeeves generally seeks to impose confidentiality and security obligations on such companies to protect your data.

When requesting that personally identifiable information be removed, please keep in mind that there will be residual information that will remain within Ask Jeeves' databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information.
The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, Ask Jeeves reserves the right, from time to time, to recontact former customers or visitors to its websites.
