In a nutshell: 
 Your Privacy and Security are a top priority at iHerb.
Since our inception in 1996, iHerb has never shared, rented or sold any customer information to any other party--and never will.
When you submit personal information on iHerb.com, your information is protected both online and offline.
==========
We can only access your credit card (but not your actual credit card information) to issue credits--never for actual charges.
Only you can produce a charge by placing an order in your password-protected account.
==========
While on a secure page, such as our order form, your browser is temporarily locked.
This indicates that the connection between your web browser and our web server is secure.
While on a secure page, the 'http' on your browser changes to 'https.'
==========
When you submit sensitive information (such as your credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry: Secure Socket Layer.
We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, once we receive it.
==========
As always, iHerb.com will never sell, rent or share your personal information with any other parties.
And we will never share it, unless required by law.
Information Collected and How it is Used
When you register with iHerb.com, you are asked for a login ID and password in order to establish the registration.
Once registered, you must input your name and address to facilitate ordering from iHerb.com.
Registration is required to order from us.
==========
During this process, you will be asked for shipping information, name, address, telephone number, email and type of payment method.
This information is collected in order to process your purchase and we use it for shipping purposes only.
==========
Like most standard website servers, we use log files.
This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp and number of clicks, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
==========
Disclosure to Third Parties
We use third party service providers such as credit card processors and delivery companies to assist us with fulfilling your order.
These companies use your information to authorize payment and to deliver your order to you.
==========
Otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share or transfer your personal information to third parties.
The information you give us is confidential, and will not be sold, or given to any individual or company or organization.
This is our promise to you.
==========

Sessions and Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes.
We use cookies on this website.
However, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.
==========
iHerb.com's store will create a temporary session when you place an item in your shopping cart.
The session is used to maintain the shopping cart and make ordering products easier.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us which content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
==========
Security
When you submit personal information on our website, we will protect your information both online and offline.
When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry: Secure Socket Layer.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the icon on the bottom of your web browser--such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer--becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing.'
We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
For example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited-access, secured facilities.
==========
iHerb.com's employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures.
If you have any questions about the security of our website, please send an email to: security@iHerb.com.

If you need to correct or update your personal information (such as your email address), or if you no longer desire our services, you can let us know by emailing customer service at info@iHerb.com, or by calling 951.616.3600.
Notification of Changes
In the event that we have to change our privacy policy, we will post a notice of the change on our home page, so you are aware of which information we collect, and under what circumstances, if any, we would disclose it.
If, at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our website 30 days prior to implementing the change.
You will have a choice as to whether or not to let us use your information in this different manner.
Legal Disclaimer
We may disclose personal information when required by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process served on our website.
