SBS takes the privacy of users of its Websites seriously and seeks to comply with all elements of the Privacy Act 1988 ("the Act") in its on-line conduct.
When you visit this website, our internet service provider makes a record of the visits and logs the following information for statistical purposes — the user’s server address, the user’s top-level domain name (eg: .
com, .
gov, .
au etc.), the date and time of visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited and the type of browser used.
No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, as required by a law enforcement agency exercising a warrant to inspect the service provider’s 
logs.
==========
SBS makes use of "cookies" to enhance the functionality of this website.
However, cookies are not used to record any personal information (eg: name, address, e-mail address.)
We will only record your e-mail address or other personal details if you send us a message (eg: in entering a competition or viewer feedback etc.).
It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it to SBS and will not be added to a mailing list unless you have consented to this.
We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose and, subject to paragraph 5, will not disclose it, without your consent.
==========
Where an SBS website is produced in conjunction with a third party ("SBS Partner"), personal information submitted to that website may be recorded by either SBS or the SBS Partner.
However, SBS imposes contractual restrictions equivalent to those imposed on SBS by the Act in respect of collection and use of personal information by such third parties.
SBS appreciates that some people may not wish to submit information via email or the internet.
If you do not wish to submit personal information to SBS through our websites or via email, you can write to SBS at Locked Bag 028, Crow’s Nest, NSW 1585.
