==========
The following Privacy Policy provides information about Adello and our mobile advertising platform AdCTRL, explains who we are, how we collect, share and use information, and how users can exercise their privacy rights.
The Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect through our website www.adello.com (“Website”), or process in the course of providing our products and services through our Mobile Advertising Platform AdCTRL (“AdCTRL”).
What does Adello do?
Adello operates AdCTRL, a transparent and neutral mobile advertising platform which is based on Adello’s artificial intelligence technology and facilitates the creation and execution of mobile advertising campaigns on advertising spaces of numerous publications which are partly represented by intermediaries (eg.
==========
Ad Exchanges), and sold by Adello.
Adello uses AdCTRL for real-time large-scale data processing.
This ensures that advertisers and their intermediaries (eg.
==========
media agencies) are enabled to place ads based on predicted interests, affinities and local context, and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Our aim is to reduce the number of ads that aren’t beneficial or of interest to users.
==========
AdCTRL is not a data provider, nor a media agency nor an ad network.
AdCTRL is not built on cookies.
==========
The platform is operated in the EU and has been developed with user privacy at the core of its design from day one.
It is subject to GDPR and applicable national data protection laws.
==========
What information do we collect and why?
As a general rule, we aim not to collect any information which would put us into the position of being able to identify an individual.
We may deviate from this rule only where we have the users consent, where we need the information to provide our contractual obligation to them or where we have a legitimate interest to do so.
