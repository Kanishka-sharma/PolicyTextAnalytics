This section details information for visitors to our Website www.cometsystems.com.
If you are a visitor to one of our other Websites, or a user of one of our Software Products, please return to our Privacy Policy's Introduction page and select from the options presented there to read the section of our privacy policy that most directly applies to you.
At www.cometsystems.com,  we do NOT collect any personal information.
==========
"Personal Information" includes (1) information that identifies you personally, such as your name, phone number, mailing address, email address, etc., (2) demographic information, such as your age, gender, income level, household size, etc., and (3) psychographic information, such as your hobbies, interests, reason for using particular software, etc.
Comet Systems collects none of this information from any of the visitors to our Websites.
The only times we receive names, email addresses, or other information that identifies you personally, are when people contact us, for example, with a tech support question.
In such cases, we keep this information confidential and use it strictly to respond to their requests.
==========
What anonymous information is collected about visitors to www.cometsystems.com
"Anonymous Information" means information that cannot be traced back to you as a specific individual.
Comet Systems receives standard Web log information: referrer ID, IP addresses and system information.
==========
None of this information identifies you personally—it is anonymous.
We do not link this information with any personally identifiable information.
We use this information to improve the performance of our site and of our products.
==========
What is a cookie?
A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that Websites often store on a user's computer.
Our cookies do not include people's names, email addresses, or other information that identifies you personally; they are used to identify a computer, not a person.
Cookie technology is fairly commonplace on the Internet because cookies allow Websites to personalize their service based on a user's preferences.
On most browsers, you can ask to be notified by your browser when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.
==========
Comet Systems does not require that you accept cookies.
Your use of www.cometsystems.com will not be impaired if you do not accept cookies.
==========
How does Comet Systems use cookies?
Comet uses one type of cookie.
This cookie stores information about whether a surfer has been prompted to download the Comet Cursor software.
Some Websites only want their visitors to see one offer to download the Comet Cursor software; we use the cookie to note this so as to avoid repeated download solicitations.
This cookie is never linked with personally identifiable information.
We currently use no other cookies on www.cometsystems.com; as appropriate, however, we may do so in the future.
==========
What is a referrer ID?
A "referrer ID" is information from your Web browser which shows us what URL (Web address) you linked from.
This allows us to see what Websites linked to our Website.
==========
This information is automatically gathered by our server.
Referrer IDs contain no information that identifies you personally.
What is an IP address?
An IP address is used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet.
Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.
They are automatically gathered by our Web server when you visit our Websites.
Comet Systems will not use your IP address to attempt to identify you personally.
==========
What is system information?
System information we gather from our Web logs includes time of visit, type of browser used, the operating system and platform, and CPU speed.
This kind of anonymous information is routinely sent by your browser when you connect to Websites.
Comet Systems uses this information only for broad demographic statistics.
For example: it tells us what percentage of users have Netscape browsers versus Internet Explorer.
==========
You will not be identified personally by this information.
What if our Privacy Policy Changes?
==========
Comet Systems does not require you to register to use the Comet Cursor software.
In other words, 
people using our software are anonymous.
==========
We only collect names and emails from a (relatively) small 
group of people who explicitly provide it, for example, by asking to receive our newsletter.
And in 
such cases, we only use your name and email address to send you the newsletter you requested - we 
do not sell it or share it with other companies.
If at some point we want to change this policy and 
say, rent out our mailing list, we will have to get your express permission first.
We will e-mail you to 
ask whether or not you will allow us to use your information in such a manner.
==========
In addition, if we 
make changes to our privacy policy, we will post a notice on our site for 30 days updating our users 
of these changes.
