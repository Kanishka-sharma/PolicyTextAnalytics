We will make every effort to protect your privacy by adopting a consistently high level of site security and adhering to strict company policies on how we store and use personal information.

What information is being collected and how is it used?
There are various sections of the website, for which we collect different information.
What we collect and how this is used is as follows:
1.1 Registered Users
Many of our websites require subscriptions and/or registration to access certain functions, services or content.
You will know what information is being collected via these processes when you complete required details prior to submission (including which information is mandatory).
On some of our websites, where you submit a response for publication your name and other personal details may be published.
You should check the policy on the relevant submission page on the specific BMJ Group website.
==========
We will collect data relating to any transactions you carry out through our website(s) and of the fulfilment of your orders.
We collate data about registered users and which publications and services they have subscribed to so to understand our customers and try and easily fulfil their subscription requirements.
For conferences we will use your personal data also to inform the venue and caterers of all delegates, create a delegate list of attendees and sponsors.
==========
Once you start using our sites, we may track and keep a record of the pages you visit.
We collect this data from groups of users to get a sense of how people are using our sites and which content and areas are most popular.
This helps us improve what we offer on our sites.
We will also use your data to monitor for any unauthorised use of our websites, content or subscriptions to our publications (for example individuals subscribing individually for institutions).
==========
We may also disclose your identity and contact details to any third party claiming material posted by you is defamatory or violates their intellectual property rights or right to privacy.

This is for the purpose of understanding the effectiveness of our email marketing campaigns and for targeting future email campaigns.

We review our security measures regularly.
==========
Despite our best efforts, and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet, or anywhere else.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see below).
5.4 Data within our walls
The information we collect about people visiting the site is stored in secure environments that are not available to any other individual or party.
==========
We have mechanisms in place to protect data.
One such mechanism is called a "firewall."
A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through.
It safeguards our computer systems and your information.
==========
We also use system and application logs to track all access.
We review these logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.
