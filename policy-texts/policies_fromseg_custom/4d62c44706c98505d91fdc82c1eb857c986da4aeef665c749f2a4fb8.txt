These measures may include encryption of information you provide and employment of information storage security technologies to block access from outside our network.

In the unlikely event of a breach of our security measures if your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as that term is defined in applicable state statutes) is obtained by a third party not authorized to view such information, and we are required by law to provide you with notification of such unauthorized viewing, then we will notify you via email or a conspicuous posting on our Site without unreasonable delay.
We will take immediate steps to determine the scope of the breach and restore the security measures to our system.
