==========
DATA PROTECTION AND YOU
As the Internet continues to evolve and our use of it continues to change and grow, the laws enacted to protect us also change and grow, giving us some peace-of-mind as we increase and expand our interactions on the web.
The biggest change to come is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become effective on May 25, 2018.
Although its scope applies to the EU, most individuals, companies and organizations worldwide will be impacted.
==========
So what does this mean to you?
This means that most organizations will now have to put in place a privacy regime that will be transparent, providing you with sufficient information on your rights and how your data is collected and used.
Since Sectigo has always been committed to your privacy and has undertaken security measures that ensure the protection of your data,
we are ready
