Service Ready Date.
Billing for your NetZero dial-up Service will automatically begin upon registration of your service.
Billing for your NetZero DSL service will automatically begin on the date provisioning of your DSL service is complete and ready for use ("Service Ready Date").
Please note that the Service Ready Date is not determined by the date you install and/or initially use the DSL service, but rather the date the DSL service is provided to your location by NetZero's service provider.
==========
Money Back Guarantee.
NetZero may provide a thirty (30) day money back guarantee for some of the NetZero Services (see your service plan description).
If your plan includes a money back guarantee, your thirty (30) day money-back guarantee begins upon the date NetZero begins billing you for the NetZero Service as described in the previous section.
During this thirty (30) day period you may cancel the NetZero Service and receive a full refund of the monthly charge you have actually paid to NetZero as well as any activation charges paid to NetZero; provided, however, in order to receive your refund you must return all Equipment to NetZero in good working condition within thirty (30) days of termination.
NetZero will provide you with a pre-paid mailing label and instructions for the return of your Equipment.
==========
In the event you fail to return the Equipment within thirty (30) days, you will be unable to receive your refund.
Early termination fees will not apply to NetZero Service terminated within the thirty (30) day money-back guarantee period.
The thirty (30) day money-back guarantee does not apply to customers who change between monthly, annual, bundle or other NetZero Service pricing plans.
The money-back guarantee is limited to one per subscriber per address.
==========
DSL or Dial-up Subscribers with Month-to-Month Accounts.
If you are a month-to-month DSL service or dial-up service customer (e.g., you have fulfilled your minimum commitment or your subscription plan did not include a minimum commitment), either you or NetZero may terminate this Agreement without cause by giving notice to the other.
Termination by you will be effective upon your notice to NetZero.
Activation or set-up fees paid at the initiation of your NetZero Service, if any, are not refundable, except during the thirty (30) day money-back guarantee period.
==========
Additionally, if your NetZero Service plan includes a minimum term commitment and such NetZero Service is terminated for any reason prior to the completion of your minimum term commitment, you agree to pay NetZero the Early Termination Fee set forth in your plan description.
Termination by NetZero shall be effective thirty (30) days after the date of notice to you, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
In the event of termination by NetZero, for any reason, you will be required to pay the remaining balance of the charges applicable to your Service through the effective date of termination.
Early Termination Fee.
Your NetZero Service may include a minimum term commitment (see your service plan description).
==========
Your minimum term begins on the billing start date as described in the foregoing section titled "Service Ready Date".
IN THE EVENT THAT YOU TERMINATE (OR TAKE AN ACTION THAT CAUSES TERMINATION OF) YOUR NETZERO SERVICE BEFORE SATISFYING THE MINIMUM TERM COMMITMENT UNDER YOUR PLAN, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY NETZERO UPON DISCONTINUANCE OF THE SERVICE A TERMINATION FEE AS SET FORTH IN YOUR PLAN DESCRIPTION (THE "EARLY TERMINATION FEE").
In addition to any applicable Early Termination Fee, you will be required to pay the remaining balance of the charges applicable to your NetZero service through the effective date of termination.
==========
If you terminate DSL service at your location, your existing plan may not be carried over to a new location.
Termination and/or Suspension by NetZero.
NetZero may terminate the NetZero Services upon notice to you for any reason.
Additionally, if, in the sole discretion of NetZero: (a) you are in breach of any of the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all policies regarding abuse and acceptable use of the NetZero Services; (b) your use of the NetZero Services is prohibited by law or is disruptive to, adversely impacts, or causes a malfunction to the NetZero Services or the use and enjoyment of other users; or (c) NetZero receives an order from a court to terminate your service; (d) if NetZero for any reason ceases to offer a NetZero Service entirely or in a particular geographic area or specific location; or (e) if you no longer live in an area where NetZero provides the NetZero Service for which you subscribed, then NetZero at its sole election may terminate or suspend your NetZero Service immediately without notice.
==========
For termination in accordance with this Section, you shall be liable for the applicable fees and/or Equipment charges set forth in previous paragraphs (depending on which fees or charges are applicable).
Events that could cause Termination of your DSL Service.
If you are purchasing a fixed line DSL service (i.e., non-satellite DSL service), your DSL service is tied to the broadband connection into your house or building.
As such, certain actions you take that impact your broadband connection could result in the termination of your DSL service.
Such actions include, but are not limited to, changing your telephone service provider, changing your telephone number, or ordering a service that impacts or changes your underlying broadband connection (such as ordering cable television service from a telephone company).
==========
ANY SUCH TERMINATION WILL BE TREATED AS TERMINATION OF YOUR DSL SERVICE BY YOU AND MAY RESULT IN AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE.
ADDITIONALLY, YOUR DSL SERVICE IS NOT PORTABLE.
SHOULD YOU MOVE, YOU WILL NEED TO CANCEL YOUR DSL SERVICE (WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE) AND REORDER IT.
==========
Regulatory Compliance.
In the event there is a ruling, regulation, or order issued by a judicial, legislative or regulatory body that causes NetZero to believe that this Agreement may be in conflict with such rules, regulations, and orders, NetZero may terminate or modify the NetZero Services and/or this Agreement immediately without notice.

NetZero or its suppliers may, at any time, without notice or liability, restrict the use of NetZero Services or limit their time of availability in order to perform maintenance activities and to maintain session control.
==========

6.0 Policy to Terminate Use of Services for Copyright Infringement
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512 as amended by Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, NetZero will terminate your account if you use your account privileges to unlawfully transmit copyrighted material without a license, valid defense or fair use privilege to do so.
