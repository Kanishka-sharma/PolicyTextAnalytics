What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet connection, so you can keep your online activity private and stop third parties like your ISP, employer, the government, or hackers from seeing what you do online.
You can also access your favorite content from any location as a VPN also gets you around any content restrictions.
==========
Who is tracking you online?
Internet Service Providers can:
See everything you do online
Sell your medical, financial, and browsing history
Employers can:
Snoop on your online activities
Limit your career opportunities if you transgress company policy
Hackers can:
Steal your identity
Hack into your accounts
Governments can:
Censor what you see
Spy on you
Avast SecureLine VPN protects your privacy
Hide your IP address
Your IP address is one of the main ways internet service providers, and others, keep track of you online.
==========
So don’t give them more than you have to: our servers will be your mask by giving you a new IP Address.
A single shared IP address
It’s easier to get lost in a crowd.
Whenever you connect to our servers, you get the same IP address as everyone else connected to it – this makes it that much harder for traffic on that server to be associated with any one of you.
Get DNS leak protection
We make sure that your browsing data is secure against DNS leaks, so your internet service providers never sees your IP Address or what you’re doing online.
Enjoy no activity logging
Once you’re connected to our servers, we don’t track the apps you use, the websites you visit, or the content you consume, period.
If someone asks, we just can’t answer.
==========
Smart VPN Mode
Enjoy a seamless browsing experience with no compromise on privacy and security.
Smart VPN automatically selects your optimal server location, so you can focus on enjoying your connected life with no hassle.
==========
Hides your online activities
Doesn’t log websites visited or app usage
DNS leak protection
A VPN also protects you from network threats
With bank-grade encryption, your data is always secure and safe from online scammers and network threats.
Get privacy protection built on transparency
We’ve built your protection on the most widely used and trusted VPN protocol: OpenVPN.
It is the most trusted because it’s open source.
==========
No unknown proprietary code is doing odd things with your data.
We use OpenSSL libraries and run the whole thing over UDP ports so you get the fastest speeds.
Get security you can always trust
Our cipher of choice is 256-bit advanced encryption standard (AES).
Why?
==========
Well, it’s not just that it would take a hypothetical hypercomputer longer than the heat-death of the universe to crack it.
It’s also because there wouldn’t be enough energy in the universe to run this hypothetical computer in the first place.
==========
We’re thorough that way.
Apple-approved
Our iOS and macOS implementations use the IPsec protocol, and we’ve built it all on Apple’s proprietary stacks to ensure the best compatibility and performance.
==========
Our goal: connecting you at lightning speed.
Protect yourself against common online scams
It’s not always easy to spot when you’re being tricked or exploited online but Avast SecureLine VPN gives you advanced protection against these common types of attacks.
==========
Avoid packet sniffing
You’re connected to an open, unprotected network and log into your accounts.
But you’re not alone on the network.
==========
So you get a cookie, they get a cookie.
They now have access to your account.
Spot fake hotspots
You’re connected to your favorite hip coffee shop Wi-Fi, right?
Are you sure it’s their network?
Do they even have Wi-Fi?
==========
Maybe they don’t and you’re now mainlining your data into an attacker’s computer.
Beware the evil twin trick
Your devices just love to auto connect to known networks and save you time.
That’s a pretty risky thing to do.
It’s easy to create a doppelganger network that will fool your phone, computer – or even you.
Stop man-in-the-middle attacks
Unknown to you, someone inserts themselves between you and the internet.
==========
They can change what you see on your favorite sites, redirect you to fake sites, take over your communications, and steal your accounts and passwords.
Bank-grade encryption
Based on open-source technology for Windows and Android
Apple-approved for best compatibility and performance
Protection over public Wi-Fi and unsecured networks
It’s your internet, take it back
Your IP address isn’t just used to track you online, it’s also used to bar you from certain services.
==========
Avast SecureLine VPN stops spies and lets you access the content you love, anonymously, from wherever you are.

Where speed meets capacity
Connect securely with the confidence that your speed and performance won’t be affected — with our network of servers, we can handle almost any capacity.
Enjoy top performance — even at the busiest times
All of our VPN gateways run on dedicated hardware servers and we make sure they have enough excess capacity to maintain performance even under peak loads.
==========
We run systems on top of that to balance web traffic, so our servers never become overloaded.
Capacity at scale
SecureLine VPN is currently backed by more than 700 servers — we add more all the time and they’re yet to reach their limits.
But if we ever get close, we can quickly extend our capacity by tapping into a trusted network of partners across the world.
Speed under pressure
Each of our servers has a theoretical maximum throughput of 2 Gbits/s.
But theory isn’t the real world.
We regularly put them through stress tests and get average speeds of 450-600 Mbits/s even under periods of intense loads.
And since it’s all running over UDP, it’s fast enough to get your deathmatch on, all day long.
