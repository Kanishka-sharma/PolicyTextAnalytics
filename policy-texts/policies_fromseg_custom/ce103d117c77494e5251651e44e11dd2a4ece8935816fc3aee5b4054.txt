Privacy Policy
Our goal is to make Kayak the most trusted site in
online travel.
To do this, we need your help, so any suggestions for
improvement can be sent to us directly via the 
privacy feedback form.
Kayak is a search engine that saves you time and money.
We
search the web for the best fares and rates; and then you go directly
to a travel supplier's website to make your purchase.
So, this means
we do not take your credit card information and we do not take your
hard earned money.
Registration on Kayak is strictly voluntary.
==========
You
do get some cool information and access to certain great features if
you do register, but membership is not necessary to get our great
rates and fares.
What's Your Sign?
Kayak collects personally identifiable information (PII, or
"Your Info") that you provide to us.
This includes (at your
discretion) your name, an email address, and a password.
Our software
uses the PII to personalize and manage the Kayak website for you.
For
example, our site stores your favorite airport and airlines.
==========
If you
do decide to give us this information, you are telling us that this
information is both true and accurate.
Also, you are telling us that
you have the authorization to provide us with that information.
In order to make our site more efficient, we may also collect
certain non PII information (such as destination or site usage
behavior) based on your use of Kayak.
We may use this information to
display advertising that you find interesting and suppress advertising
that you might find boring or annoying.
For example, we might show
you travel offers from your home airport, but not those from airports
that are other places in the country.
To help us debug problems with our software (rare as they are), we
may collect some technical information from your browser software
(such as Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer), screen resolution and
the website that referred you to us.
==========
We'll Keep You In The Loop
When you choose to register with us, Kayak logs you in
automatically using your email address.
This makes it easier for you
as you don't have to create and remember a login identifier.
The use
of your email address for login also allows Kayak the chance to email
you a new password in case you forget or lost your old one.
==========
This is
perfectly OK and happens to the best of us, particularly those of us
that are incredibly busy.
If you do register with us, Kayak will save
your information and recognize you regardless of where you login from.
So if you are visiting friends and using their computer, we'll know
it's you and display your searches and preferences when you do login.
Kayak gives you the option of receiving emails from us.
==========
We think
they are quite amusing, but you may not and can opt out any time.
Our
emails are sent from a Kayak address and are sent to your real
email address.
Every email that we send has an opt-out URL, so you can
be unsubscribed when you want.
We do hate spam at Kayak and suspect
that you do too.
==========
In This Case Sharing Is Not Caring
What's yours is yours.
The PII that you chose to share with us is
not going anywhere off of our site.
We won't sell your PII to
anyone.
==========
There might be one exception in the event Kayak itself is
sold.
In this case we would transfer your PII to our buyers so that
they could continue to provide the same great Kayak service.
Kayak occasionally will share aggregated usage information with
others.
This type of information does not contain your identity or
anything personally identifiable to you.
If The Police Come Knocking At Our Door
Kayak may disclose to authorized law enforcement personnel the
personal data from anyone who poses a threat to our interests.
This
might include those that are attempting to commit fraud or those who
conduct activities that could bring harm to others.
==========
We assume that
this is not you so please don't worry.
You Are The Boss
Kayak members and site visitors have control over the use of their
personal data.
Since you are the boss on Kayak, you always can change
your account settings in the "My Profile" page on Kayak.
How does
it feel to be such a big shot?
==========
Protecting Your Information
Kayak has a sophisticated security program intended to keep the
information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access.
We store your information in secure data centers located in the United
States.
Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling
technologies and firewalls constructed to the highest industry
standards.
We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that
protects the data you send over the Internet.
Third party security
firms review our internal security policies and documentation
regularly.
The bottom line is, when it comes to information security,
we mean business.
==========
Cookies (Not The Kind You Eat With Milk)
When you visit Kayak we may store information about your web
session and assign you one or more 'cookies'.
You browser will store
these cookies on you computer in a small text file.
For example, when
you decide to login as a Kayak member, we store encrypted information
in your browser so you don't have to login on every page.
Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until
you delete them manually using your browser or operating system
software.
You can enable your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so
may disable access to some services and tools that we offer.
==========
Kayak does make money by selling advertising as well as referrals
from searches on our site.
Our third party advertising partners often
use a cookie or third party web beacon ( a single pixel GIF image) to
track when a click becomes a sale (cha ching), No PII is ever sent to
these advertising partners.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
visit our web site.
These companies may use information (not
including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about
your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

choices about not having this information used by these companies,

Every Website Has Its Own Voice and Policies
Although we work with responsible third parties, their business
policies may include different privacy policies and practices than we
have.
So when you click through to third party website, our privacy
policies no longer apply.
We encourage you to read the privacy
policies of these partner websites.
==========
Big Kids Only Please
Kayak does not knowingly collect PII information from people under
the age of 18.
If we become aware of the fact that a minor is
attempting to submit this information, we will inform the minor that
he or she is ineligible to do so.
We will then remove this information
from our records.
==========
Should We Evolve, Change, Self Actualize
Kayak reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any
time.
If there are material changes to this statement on how Kayak
will use your PII, we will prominently post these changes prior to
implementing them.
If you use our website after we post these changes,
this indicates your acceptance of them.
==========
Regardless of later updates,
we will follow the privacy practices described in this privacy
statement at the time you provided us with your information.
If you
have questions about our privacy policies, please email us at privacy-team@kayak.com.
