Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors
 SRI may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail
addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine
used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the
Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with SRI

online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, contest entries,
and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic
and personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific

SRI may place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives.
Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the
visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen
preferences, and the pages of the Site viewed by the visitor.
When
the visitor revisits the Site, SRI may recognize the visitor by the
Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly,
for example, in pre-filling forms.
Visitors may decline or remove
Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their
Web client software, if available.
SRI also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain
information related to your visit to and activity on the Site.
==========
A Web
bug is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a
transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a
Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity.
A Web bug
can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the
Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.
==========
When a visitor performs a search within the Site, SRI may record
information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the
search performed.
SRI may also record limited information for every
search request and use that information to solve technical problems
with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with
the Site, and to calculate overall usage statistics.

Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties
 Subject to the limitations of Paragraph 4, aggregate data on
visitors' home servers may be provided to third parties such as
marketing firms.
Identifiable and non-identifiable visitor information and data
which visitors provide to SRI may be provided to third parties who
provide products, information, or services which SRI believes that
visitors may be interested in directly or indirectly purchasing or
obtaining.
Identifiable or non-identifiable data also may be
disclosed or distributed to another party with which SRI enters or
reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for
example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or
to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of
legal process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local,
state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body,
whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of
legal process, or if determined by SRI in its sole judgment that such
disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health,
security, or property of SRI or any other person or entity.
While SRI will undertake efforts to see that any third party to
which SRI shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data
is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for
the purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties are
independent third parties over which SRI exercises no control, and SRI
is not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or
information handling or dissemination practices and SRI will not be
liable therefor.

about Site visitors.

and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other Web

Security Measures
 SRI has implemented numerous security features to prevent the
unauthorized release of or access to personal information.

example, SRI: undertakes all efforts to maintain a secure server; does
not store any user credit card information; and requires employees and
service providers who work for or with SRI to sign confidentiality and
security contracts restricting their use of any data related to user
information.
Please be advised, however, that the confidentiality of
any communication or material transmitted to or from SRI via this Site
or e-mail cannot be guaranteed.

of this Privacy Statement.
