TD Guaranteed Investment Funds II Disclosure:
TD Guaranteed Investment Funds II ("TD GIF II") policies are Individual Variable Insurance Contracts issued by ivariTM and are managed by TDAM.
ivari is the issuer of the TD GIF II contract.
As of March 11th, 2009, TD GIF II was closed to new policies and as of April 15th, 2009, all existing policies were closed to additional deposits.
==========
A complete description of the key features of TD GIF II is contained in the TD GIF II Annuity Policy and Information Folder.
In the event of any discrepancy between the Annuity Policy and Information Folder and this document, the Annuity Policy and Information Folder take precedence.
==========
Any amount that is allocated to a segregated fund is invested at the risk of the Contract Owner and may increase or decrease in value.
When entering into an Individual Variable Insurance Contract, and purchasing TD GIF II, investors are depositing money to their contract and are not buying units of the TD Mutual Funds and therefore do not possess any of the rights and privileges of the unitholders of such funds.
The performance of the TD GIF II will be slightly less than that of the underlying TD Mutual Funds due to the cost of the guarantee and benefit feature.
Past performance is not indicative of future performance and investment returns will fluctuate.
TD Mutual Funds are offered by TDAM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank.

H. Related and Connected Issuers Disclosure
Canadian securities laws require registered firms such as TD Waterhouse Canada Inc. ("TDWCI") and TD Waterhouse Private Investment Counsel Inc. ("TD PIC") to provide certain disclosures to their clients when they trade in or advise with respect to securities of certain issuers to which they, or certain other parties related to them, are "related" or "connected".
We describe the various entities that are either related or connected to TDWCI or TD PIC below and will update this Related and Connected Issuers Disclosure from time to time.
Related Issuers
An issuer of securities is "related" to TDWCI or TD PIC if through the ownership of, or direction or control over voting securities:
TDWCI or TD PIC exercises a controlling influence over that issuer, or
that issuer exercises a controlling influence over TDWCI or TD PIC, or
the same third party exercises a controlling influence over both TDWCI or TD PIC and the issuer.
The following entities, which are reporting issuers or have similarly distributed securities, are related issuers of TDWCI and TD PIC:
The Toronto-Dominion Bank ("TD"): TD is a reporting issuer under securities laws and both TDWCI and TD PIC are wholly owned subsidiaries of TD.
Therefore, TD is a related issuer of TDWCI and TD PIC.
Connected Issuers
An issuer is "connected" to TDWCI or TD PIC if there is a relationship between the issuer and TDWCI or TD PIC, a related issuer of TDWCI or TD PIC, or a director or officer of TDWCI or TD PIC, or the related issuer of TDWCI or TD PIC, that might lead a reasonable prospective purchaser of the securities of the connected issuer to question whether TDWCI or TD PIC and the issuer are independent of each other for the distribution of the issuer’s securities.
==========
Investment funds, including exchange traded funds, that have “TD”, “TDAM”, “TD Greystone” or “Epoch” in their name are connected issuers of TDWCI and TD PIC, as well as Finch Low Volatility All World Equity Fund, LLC, Aeon Global Absolute Return Fund, LLC, Aeon Global Choice Fund, LLC, Aeon Global Equity Shareholder Yield Fund, LLC, Aeon U.S. SMID Cap Value Fund, LLC.
TD Capital Trust IV, Genesis Trust II and Evergreen Credit Card Trust are issuers of TD sponsored asset-backed securities and are therefore considered to be connected issuers of TDWCI and TD PIC because TD is the founder and organizer of these issuers.
==========
The Charles Schwab Corporation ("Schwab").
Due to investment restrictions imposed on TD pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement with Schwab and applicable laws, purchases of Schwab securities by TDWCI and TD PIC for client accounts are restricted subject to limited exceptions.
In addition, in certain circumstances, issuers with whom TD or its Canadian dealer affiliate, TD Securities Inc., has a business relationship (such as being borrowers from TD or acting as an underwriter for securities sold to clients of TD or companies in which TD has a significant investment) may be considered connected issuers of TDWCI and TD PIC.
Related Registrants
TD Direct Investing, TD Wealth Financial Planning and TD Wealth Private Investment Advice are divisions of TDWCI, which is a subsidiary of TD.
==========
Similarly, TD PIC is a subsidiary of TD.
The following dealers and advisors registered in Canada are also subsidiaries of TD: Epoch Investment Partners, Inc., TD Asset Management Inc., TD Investment Services Inc., and TD Securities Inc.
TD Securities Inc. may act as an underwriter of new issue securities.
Certain directors and officers of TDWCI and TD PIC may also be directors and officers of one or more of these related registrants or TD.
TDWCI and TD PIC have adopted policies and procedures to conduct their businesses with integrity, avoid conflicts of interest and comply with applicable laws.
==========
To manage the conflicts inherent in making investment recommendations or taking investment actions for your account in related or connected issuers, TDWCI and TD PIC will only cause a client's account to be invested in securities of related or connected issuers, if such securities are considered to be suitable for a client's account and investing in such securities is considered to be in the client's best interest.
TDWCI and TD PIC have no arrangements with these related and connected issuers (or in the case of the funds, their managers) that incent TDWCI or TD PIC representatives to recommend or cause a client's account to be invested in securities of related and connected issuers over others.
Any recommendations or investments made in securities issued by a related or a connected party are evaluated using the same processes as those securities issued by a third party.

TD Bank is not responsible for the Wallet Provider or Other Third Parties, and in no event shall such terms and conditions between you and the Wallet Provider or any Other Third Party be binding on TD Bank or impose any additional obligations, or obligations inconsistent with the terms and conditions of these Terms, upon TD Bank whatsoever.

==========
Using a Payment Card in the Wallet.
If you want to add a Payment Card to the Wallet, you must follow the procedures adopted by the Wallet Provider and any further procedures we adopt.
You understand that not all Payment Cards are eligible to be added to the Wallet.
We may not allow you to add a Payment Card to the Wallet if we cannot authenticate the Payment Card or if we otherwise suspect that there may be fraud associated with the Payment Card or the Account.
The Wallet allows you and anyone else who has access to and use of your Device to make purchases using a Payment Card that has been added to the Wallet wherever the Wallet is accepted, subject to Payment Card activation and pre-set limits (which are subject to change).
When you use your Payment Card through the Wallet to transact with a merchant, it is the same as if you swiped, inserted, waved, tapped or otherwise presented your physical Payment Card or signed the credit card slip or electronic signature device presented by the merchant and/or inputted your personal identification number to transact.
Wallet transactions will be added to your credit card Account billing statement or, in the case of debit card transactions, your transaction history and Account statements (as applicable).
==========
You are financially responsible for all such transactions and associated interest charges and fees in accordance with the Account Agreement.
The Wallet may not be accepted outside of Canada or at all places where your Payment Card is accepted.
Please remember if you are using a Payment Card in the Wallet that requires you to activate the Payment Card, you may have to activate the Payment Card before using it in the Wallet.
With respect to an Account, each Account holder and Authorized User may add their Payment Card to the Wallet to allow them to use and make purchases on the Account using the Wallet on their own Device, and you will be responsible for all such transactions in accordance with the Account Agreement.
4.
==========
Applicable Fees.
We do not charge you fees for adding a Payment Card to the Wallet.
Please review the Account Agreement for any fees, interest, or other charges that apply to your Account.
In addition, the Wallet Provider or Other Third Parties may charge you service fees when you use your Device or the Wallet.
5.
==========
TD Bank is NOT Responsible for the Use or Function of the Wallet.
TD Bank is not the provider of the Wallet and is not responsible for its use and function.
We are only responsible for the Payment Card as set out in the Account Agreement.
==========
You should contact the Wallet Provider’s customer service if you have questions about how to use the Wallet or if you experience problems with the Wallet.
We are not responsible for any failure of the Wallet or your inability to use a Wallet for any transaction.
We are also not responsible for any loss, injury or inconvenience you suffer as a result of (a) any damage or vulnerabilities to your Device that may be directly or indirectly caused by the Wallet; (b) a merchant refusing to accept the Wallet; or (c) any actions or omissions of the Wallet Provider or any Other Third Party.
6.
==========
Your Responsibility to Keep Your Payment Card and Wallet Credentials Secure and Notify Us of Errors or Fraud.
You agree to protect and keep confidential all information required for you to access your Device and the Wallet, respectively, and all information required to make purchases with a Payment Card using the Wallet on your Device, including without limitation, your User ID, passwords, passcodes and/or verification questions, if applicable, and any other information used to authenticate you to provide access to your Device and the Wallet (the "Wallet Credentials").
If you share your Wallet Credentials or Device with others (including without limitation, by allowing others to enroll their fingerprint, set up a passcode on your Device or otherwise), they may be able to access your Device and the Wallet to make purchases with your Payment Card through the Wallet, view transactions on your Device (including by way of Notifications, which may be visible on your Device without any requirement for you to enter a login or password), or otherwise obtain your personal information.
You must contact us immediately if you believe there are errors or if you suspect fraud or unauthorized use of your Payment Card.
We will investigate and where appropriate resolve any potential error or fraudulent purchase on your Payment Card as set out in your Account Agreement.
We will not be liable for any losses you incur except as specifically described in the Account Agreement or as otherwise provided by law.
Before you sell, give away, or dispose of your Device, you must remove the Payment Card from the Wallet by following the Wallet Provider's procedures for removal, otherwise the Payment Card may be available to the person who obtains your Device and you will be responsible for any transactions completed.
If your Device is lost or stolen, you must contact TD Bank immediately.
7.
==========
Security of the Wallet.
In addition to your efforts to keep your Wallet Credentials secure and confidential, we take reasonable steps to help ensure that information we send to others about your use of a Payment Card in the Wallet is sent to them in a secure manner.
However, the Wallet Provider is responsible for the security of information that you provide to it or that is stored in the Wallet.
We are not responsible if there is a security breach affecting any information stored in the Wallet or sent from the Wallet.
However, in the unlikely event you experience an Account loss resulting from a transaction through the Wallet that you did not authorize or for which you are not responsible under these Terms or any other terms or agreement with us, you will be reimbursed for such Account losses provided you have met your security responsibilities and otherwise complied with your Account Agreement.
8.
==========
We Can Block, Suspend, or Cancel Your Use of a Payment Card.
We can block you or Authorized User(s) from adding an eligible Payment Card to the Wallet, suspend your or your Authorized User(s)' ability to use an eligible Payment Card to make purchases using the Wallet, or cancel entirely your or your Authorized User(s)' ability to continue to use a Payment Card in the Wallet.
We may take these actions at any time and for any reason without notice or liability to you, such as if we suspect fraud with your Payment Card or Account, if you have an overdue or negative balance on your Account, if directed to do so by the Wallet Provider, a regulator, or the applicable payment card network associated with your Payment Card (such as Visa, MasterCard or Interac), if use of the Payment Card in the Wallet would interfere with, degrade the performance of, or adversely affect any products, services or software of TD Bank or others, or if applicable laws change or where otherwise required by applicable law.
You may remove a Payment Card from the Wallet by following the Wallet Provider's procedures for removal.
9.
==========
Notifications.
You may receive notifications on your Device upon completing transactions using your Payment Card, including transactions linked to both your physical card and the Wallet (each a "Notification").
You may turn off Notifications at any time by adjusting the settings in the operating system of your Device.
We are not responsible for any failure to provide you with information (including Notifications) through the Wallet at any time or for any reason.
You should not rely on Notifications to confirm the final amount of any transaction as there could be transactions for amounts that are different than your final purchase when it is posted to your Account.

An initial discount will automatically be attributed to you when a Named Insured identifies you as wanting to become a Participating Driver.

If your Enrollment Date is within 120 days from the date the renewal Policy documents are processed by TDI, the initial discount will be removed as of the second Policy renewal date following your Enrollment Date.
==========
Once you meet the Eligibility Requirements for Program discount described in Section 4.3, the Program discount, if any, attributable to you will be applied at the next Policy renewal based on your driving score applicable at the time the renewal Policy documents are processed by TDI.
In the event you do not meet the Eligibility Requirements for a Program Discount as described in Section 4.3 above on the effective date of the next Policy renewal, there will be no Program discount attributable to you.

The Data is collected for you for every Trip, whether or not the automobile you are driving is covered under the Policy.
==========
As a result, the amount of the Program discount is impacted by your driving behavior during the enrollment period in the Program.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE TD COMPANION APP
The TD Companion App consists of TD MySpend and Clari (a chatbot).
TD MySpend is a money management tool that helps you keep track of your spending from your Eligible Accounts.
For example, this tool will help you keep track of your average or typical monthly spend and will categorize your spend (i.e. grocery, health, entertainment etc.).
==========
You will be required to download and install a separate app which works with the TD app for smartphones (the "TD MySpend app") in order to use TD MySpend.
Clari is a tool integrated into the TD app that uses TD MySpend data to respond to certain questions you ask it.
Clari can assist authenticated TD customers in answering certain questions related to spending categories and transactions on your Eligible Accounts, general financial inquiries, and frequently asked questions in English and French.
Clari will not be able to answer every type of question you ask of it.
==========
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
From time to time, TD may establish or modify certain eligibility requirements for the use of the TD Companion App.
For example, only certain TD accounts are eligible for use with the TD Companion App and only certain mobile devices and their respective operating systems support the TD Companion App.
In addition, you may not be eligible to use the TD Companion App if any one or more of your accounts are not in good standing.
==========
To be eligible to use the TD Companion App, all your TD accounts must be in good standing.
You can use your TD Canadian dollar personal chequing, savings and credit card accounts to: track and display your spending in TD MySpend; and to receive answers to the questions you ask Clari.
Business accounts are not eligible.
==========
You are not required to install TD MySpend to use Clari.
You are not required to use Clari before using TD MySpend.
CHANGING YOUR PREFERENCE SETTINGS
As noted above in the Privacy Terms, TD MySpend has preference settings that allow you to personalize your TD MySpend experience including the ability to disable any of your Eligible Accounts that you no longer want to display in TD MySpend.
In addition, for TD MySpend, you may adjust the settings in the operating system of your mobile device to turn off the receipt of Notifications.
==========
The disabling of Eligible Accounts in TD MySpend will not affect your use of Clari, where all your Eligible accounts (regardless of whether they have been disabled in TD MySpend) will be included in responses to your questions.
We encourage you to visit the FAQ for more information on all preferences available to you in the TD Companion App.
CERTAIN INFORMATION WILL BE DISPLAYED ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE
Once you sign up and register for the TD Companion App, each of your Eligible Accounts will automatically be used in the TD Companion App.
In addition, after you sign up and register for the TD Companion App, if you add another account to your customer profile (which is eligible for use with the TD Companion App), it will automatically be added for use with the TD Companion App.
You may disable any one or more of your Eligible Accounts from being displayed in TD MySpend by going to your TD MySpend preferences and turning off the Eligible Account you wish to remove.
Note that, for TD MySpend, we will continue to collect and analyze transaction data from disabled Eligible Accounts in case you change your mind and decide to display the Eligible Account in TD MySpend.
==========
We encourage you to visit the FAQ for more information on all preferences available to you in the TD Companion App.
JOINT ACCOUNTS AND AUTHORIZED USER(S)
If one or more of your Eligible Accounts is a TD joint chequing or savings account or a TD credit card account with authorized user(s), each joint account holder or authorized user, as the case may be, will be able to use the TD Companion App on their mobile device, and will receive the same information about your joint account or TD credit card account that you receive through TD MySpend (including updates on the average or typical monthly spend and all Notifications associated with the account) and Clari.
Even if you change your preferences in TD MySpend to disable a joint chequing or savings account, or disable a TD credit card account with authorized user(s), the joint account holder or authorized user will continue to be able to use the Eligible Account with the TD Companion App and receive information provided by the TD Companion App which is specific to the Eligible Account.
If you contact TD to make account ownership change(s) to either remove a joint account holder from your joint TD chequing or savings account or to remove an authorized user from your TD credit card account, it may take up to three (3) business days for the account ownership changes to take effect in the TD Companion App.
==========
This means that a joint account holder or an authorized user may be able to view the account in TD MySpend or receive responses about the account in Clari until the corresponding change is made in the TD Companion App.
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE TD COMPANION APP INCLUDING NOTIFICATIONS
As noted above in the Privacy Terms, you will receive Notifications from TD MySpend when you make a purchase from an Eligible Account (but you will not receive any Notifications from Clari).
Once you sign up and register for TD MySpend, you will automatically begin receiving Notifications (unless you refuse to grant permission to the operating system of your mobile device).
You may turn off Notifications at any time by adjusting the notification settings contained in the operating system of your mobile device.
If you receive a Notification of a transaction that you do not recognize, notify TD AT ONCE at 1-866-222-3456.
We encourage you to visit the FAQ for more information on how to change your operating system settings.
==========
TD is not responsible for the failure to provide you with information (including Notifications from TD MySpend) through the TD Companion App at any time.
Keep in mind that you may not receive a Notification from TD MySpend for each transaction (please visit our FAQ for more information) and you may not receive Notifications from TD MySpend or responses from Clari if your wireless service carrier or Internet service provider does not provide service in certain geographic areas.
You should not rely on Notifications from TD MySpend or responses from Clari to confirm the final amount of any transaction as there could be transactions for amounts that are larger than your final purchase when it is actually posted to your Eligible Account.
==========
For example, hotel and car rental services may post an authorized amount to your TD credit card account to accommodate for security deposits and gas stations may post authorized amounts to accommodate for a pre-determined amount of gas.
These amounts are then adjusted when posted to your TD credit card account, after the authorization date, when the security deposits are released from the hotel/car rental service or you do not spend the pre-determined amount of gas.
==========
You should not rely on Notifications from TD MySpend or responses from Clari for the final amount of a TD credit card transaction if you made a purchase in foreign currency as there could be a change in the initial value of the transaction (that is provided to you through a Notification) to when the transaction is posted to your Eligible Account.
This is due to the fact that the foreign exchange rate may have changed between the time of the Notification and the time the foreign currency transaction is posted to your Eligible Account.
==========
TD AGREEMENTS; TD COMPANION APP SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A MONTHLY STATEMENT
The terms of the agreements that you entered into or may enter with TD for your Eligible Account(s) or other products or services (as such agreements are amended or replaced by TD from time to time, the "TD Agreements"), apply to your use of the TD Companion App.
These Terms are in addition to and do not in any way amend or replace TD Agreements that apply to your Eligible Account(s) or particular product or service, unless we have specifically advised you in these Terms.
==========
You should not rely on the information provided by the TD Companion App (including Notifications from TD MySpend) for transactional or record keeping or tax purposes as it is provided solely for informational purposes only and is not an official TD statement of account (please refer to sections 22 and 23 for more detail).
While the TD Companion App is a helpful tool that will provide support to track your monthly spend from your Eligible Accounts and provide answers to certain questions, you must at all times continue to meet your obligations under your TD Agreements including your obligations to review statements or otherwise review all account activity and promptly tell us about any errors or omissions.
The TD Companion App and the information it provides is not a monthly statement nor should it be relied on to review your monthly account activity in order to fulfill your obligations under your TD Agreements.

The Money Transfers are transactions to which regular account transaction charges may apply.
These transaction charges are disclosed in TD's disclosure document, About our Accounts and Related Services.
==========
TD Global Transfer.
TD does not charge you a fee for the use of TD Global Transfer.
TD Transfer Services Fees.
When you use TD Transfer Services to send Money Transfers, we will charge you a transfer fee (the "TD Transfer Fee") displayed to you prior to fulfilling each transaction so you can review it and consent or decline the transaction.
==========
Third-Party Transfer Services Provider fees.
When you use the Third-Party Transfer Services to send Money Transfers, the Third-Party Transfer Services Provider will charge you a transfer fee (the "Third-Party Transfer Fee") that will be displayed to you prior to fulfilling each transaction so you can review it and consent or decline the transaction.
2.2 What other fees or amounts may apply?
TD Transfer Services.
==========
You acknowledge that the Receiver Parties and/or Intermediaries involved in the transfer may charge a fee to process the transfer, including conversion fees if funds are converted to another currency, and these fees may be deducted from the transfer amount, resulting in the Recipient receiving a lesser amount.
We do not know the fees or other amounts that the Receiver Parties or the Intermediaries may apply, including, without limitation, any local charges or taxes, and we are not liable for any fees that may be charged by a Receiver Party or any Intermediaries.
==========
Third-Party Transfer Services.
Before you submit your request to initiate the Money Transfer using the Third-Party Transfer Services, the Third-Party Transfer Services Provider is responsible for disclosing to you the details about fees, taxes, transaction limits or other relevant information relating to specific countries.
==========
2.3 What currency and foreign exchange rate is used for the Money Transfer?
TD Transfer Services.
When you make the Money Transfer using TD Transfer Services, you authorize us to send the funds using the available currency selected by you.
If you are making the Money Transfer in a currency that is different from the Funding Source you are using to fund it, we will quote you our foreign currency exchange rate.
You can choose whether to go ahead with the purchase using the foreign currency exchange rate disclosed to you at the time of the purchase.
If you agree to move forward, you are accepting the foreign currency exchange rate we disclose to you.
The foreign currency exchange rate is set by TD and will be determined by TD in its sole discretion based on the factors that we determine to be relevant.
==========
The factors include, without limitation, market conditions, foreign exchange rates charged by other parties, our costs, our risks, business factors, economic factors and the amount of profit which will be earned by TD on the foreign currency exchange and any other relevant considerations.
The foreign currency exchange rate that is set by TD is higher than the rate paid by TD to acquire and make available to you a particular currency, which means that TD earns revenue on all currency exchanges.
==========
In addition, in certain circumstances after the Money Transfer leaves TD, it may be converted to another currency.
For example, currency conversion may be necessary if you sent the Money Transfer without using the local currency of the Recipient’s financial institution or Recipient’s account.
Certain currencies are a zero-decimal currency and in certain instances payments must be entered in whole currency amounts without decimal points to avoid rejection.
Amounts converted into a currency selected by you will also be rounded up if the last digit is 5 or greater or down if the last digit is less than 5.
==========
Third-Party Transfer Services.
For the Third-Party Transfer Services, the Third-Party Transfer Service Provider determines the foreign currency exchange rate that applies to your Money Transfer.
Before you submit your request to initiate the Money Transfer using the Third-Party Transfer Services, the Third-Party Transfer Services Provider is responsible for disclosing to you the foreign currency exchange rate (including estimates).
When you use the Third-Party Transfer Services, Canadian currency is converted to foreign currency at a foreign currency exchange rate set by the Third-Party Transfer Services Provider.
==========
Any difference between the rate given to you and the rate received by Third-Party Transfer Services Provider will be kept by the Third-Party Transfer Services Provider (and its agents in some cases) in addition to the Third-Party Transfer Fee.
2.4 TD compensation
With respect to certain Money Transfers made using the Third-Party Transfer Services, TD will receive compensation from the Third-Party Transfer Service Providers.
==========
2.5 What are the limits that apply to the Money Transfer?
TD, the Third-Party Transfer Services Providers, including an Intermediaries and Receiver Parties may set limits on the Money Transfer, including the amount of money you are allowed to send, the amount of money the Recipient is allowed to receive or the currency in which the funds are received when you send the Money Transfer.
TD does not control any limits applicable to the Recipient and it is your responsibility to confirm with the Recipient what if any such limits may apply.

3.2 What might prevent the Money Transfer from completing?
TD, the Third-Party Transfer Services Provider, the Sender Parties, the Intermediaries or the Receiver Parties may hold, block or reject, as applicable, a request to send a Money Transfer because of: (i) inaccurate information detected in a Money Transfer; (ii) legal or regulatory requirements in Canada or abroad, including economic sanctions; (iii) fraud, risk or compliance policies and procedures; or (iv) other reasonable grounds from time to time.
3.3 Are there refunds for cancelled, rejected, declined, unclaimed or incomplete Money Transfer?
TD Transfer Services.
If the Money Transfer is declined or unclaimed by the Recipient, or is not completed, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to obtain a refund at your request from the Receiver Parties.
If all or some of the Money Transfer funds are returned, we will first convert the funds into the same currency as the amount of the Money Transfer at the rate of exchange set by TD, established at the time the funds are converted for the return.
We are not liable to credit you any amount which was not credited to us including the difference in the foreign currency exchange rates.
