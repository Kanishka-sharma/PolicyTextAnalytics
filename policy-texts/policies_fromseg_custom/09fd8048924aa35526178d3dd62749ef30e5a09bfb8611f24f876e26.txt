About the California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides that California residents may (subject to certain limitations) request to:
Access the personal information we collect about them
Delete the personal information we collect about them
Opt out of having their personal information sold
While we don't share personal information with third parties in exchange for money, we do disclose certain information in exchange for insights and other valuable services.
California law treats such sharing as a “sale” even if no money is exchanged.
Read Information Sharing for more details.
