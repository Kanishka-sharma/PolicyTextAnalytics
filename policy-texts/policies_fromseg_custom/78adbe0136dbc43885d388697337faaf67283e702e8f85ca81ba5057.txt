Thank you for using Airbnb!
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the Airbnb Platform.
If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “Airbnb Platform”), it has the same definition as outlined in our Terms of Service.
When this policy mentions “Airbnb,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Airbnb company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “Data Controller”).
If you reside in the United States, the Data Controller is Airbnb, Inc.
If you reside outside of the United States and the People’s Republic of China (for purposes of this Privacy Policy, the People’s Republic of China does not include Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) (“China”), the Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland UC (“Airbnb Ireland”).
If you reside in China, the Data Controller is Airbnb Internet (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Airbnb China”), except where you book a Host Service or create a Listing located outside of China, in which case, the Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland for that transaction.
Additionally, Airbnb Ireland will be the Data Controller for all bookings confirmed prior to December 7, 2016 at 10:00am UTC.
If you change your place of residence, the Data Controller will be determined by your new place of residence as specified above, from the date on which your place of residence changes.
==========
This Privacy Policy also applies to the Payment Services provided to you by Airbnb Payments pursuant to the Payments Terms of Service (“Payments Terms”).
One or more Airbnb Payments entities will be the Data Controller of your information related to the Payment Services depending on where your Payment Method or Payout Method is issued:
If issued in the United States, the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments, Inc. (a subsidiary of Airbnb, Inc.).
If issued in China, the Data Controller is Airbnb China, except if: (i) you book or create a Listing outside of China, (ii) book a Listing in China with a Host who is not a resident of China, or (iii) the booking was confirmed prior to December 7, 2016 at 10:00am UTC, in which case the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments UK Ltd.
If issued in India, the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments India Pvt. Ltd., except if you use a Payout Method issued in India and accept a booking from a Guest with a Payment Method that is not issued in India, in which case the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments UK Ltd.
If issued outside of the United States, China, and India, the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments UK Ltd.

When your booking is confirmed, we will disclose additional information to assist with coordinating the trip, like your phone number.
When you as a Host (or Co-Host, if applicable) have a confirmed booking, certain information is shared with the Guest to coordinate the booking, such as your full name, phone number, and Accommodation or Experience address.
When you as a Host invite another Member to become a Co-Host, you authorize the Co-Host to access your information and Member Content, including but not limited to certain information like your full name, phone number, Accommodation address, and email address.
We don’t share your billing and payout information with other Members.
==========
3.3 Profiles, Listings, and other Public Information.
The Airbnb Platform lets you publish information that is visible to the general public.
For example:
Parts of your public profile page, such as your first name, your description, and city, are publicly visible to others.
Public Listing pages are publicly visible and include information such as the Accommodation or Experience’s approximate location (neighborhood and city), Listing description, calendar availability, the Host public profile photo, aggregated demand information (like page views over a period of time), and any additional information the Host chooses to share.
After completing a booking, Guests and Hosts may write reviews and rate each other.
Reviews are a part of your public profile page.
If you submit content in a public forum or social media post, or use a similar feature on the Airbnb Platform, that content is publicly visible.
Information you share publicly on the Airbnb Platform may be indexed through third party search engines.
==========
In some cases, you may opt-out of this feature in your Account settings.
If you change your settings or your public-facing content, these search engines may not update their databases.
We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information.
==========
3.4 Service Providers.
We use a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the Airbnb Platform.
Service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
For example, service providers may help us: (i) verify or authenticate your identification, (ii) check information against public databases, (iii) assist us with background checks, fraud prevention, and risk assessment, or (iv) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services.
These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually obligated to use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
==========
3.5 Additional Services by Hosts.
Hosts may use third party services available through the Airbnb Platform to assist with managing their Accommodation or providing additional services, such as cleaning services or lock providers.
Hosts may use features on the Airbnb Platform to share information about the Guest (like check-in and check-out dates, Guest name, Guest phone number, and Guest anonymized email address) with that third party service provider for the purposes of coordinating the stay, managing the Accommodation, or delivering other services.
3.6 Airbnb Payments.
Airbnb Payments may share your personal information to: (i) provide the Payment Services, (ii) facilitate your use of the Airbnb Platform, and (iii) jointly market products or services to you with other financial third parties with whom Airbnb Payments has a formal agreement.

We will attempt to notify Members about these requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Airbnb’s property, its Members and the Platform (collectively, “Risk Scenarios”).
In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about the request after the fact if we determine in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no Risk Scenarios apply.

To help us provide the Airbnb Platform, we may share your information within our corporate family of companies (both financial and non-financial entities) that are related by common ownership or control.
