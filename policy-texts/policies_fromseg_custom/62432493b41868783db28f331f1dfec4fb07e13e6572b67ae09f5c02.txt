                          and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of

ZEDO is a Technology Service Provider
                          In most cases, when you see an Internet ad “Powered 
                          by ZEDO”, the Web site has asked ZEDO to act as 
                          an agent for ad delivery and reporting.
The information 
                          ZEDO processes on such a Web site's behalf belongs to 
                          the Web site and is not used by ZEDO in any way.
ZEDO 
                          gathers this information with ‘cookies’.
Cookies and ZEDO
                          Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer: 
                          A cookie file simply contains a string of alphanumeric 
                          characters, which is passed from a Web site to your 
                          computer, and back to the Web site, unchanged, for recognition 
                          purposes.
Web sites use cookies to recognize a computer 
                          that has previously visited the site or page.

Cookies 
                          are often wrongly categorized as “Spyware”, 
                          or as a virus or other malicious program.
A cookie itself 
                          cannot do anything except help a Web site behave in 
                          a manner customized to you.
ZEDO uses cookies to enhance the Web experience by 
                          preventing users from seeing the same Internet ad over 
                          and over again.
ZEDO does not use cookies 
                          to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies 
                          can not damage your system or files.
You can tell your browser to accept or reject cookies 
                          for all sites, or for specific sites; but remember, 
                          rejecting cookies may affect the way your favorite sites 
                          behave.
Opting Out
                          If you do not want to store this information in your

There is more than one way to opt out of cookies: manually
