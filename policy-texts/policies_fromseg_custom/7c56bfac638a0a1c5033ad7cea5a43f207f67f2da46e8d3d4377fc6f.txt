What personally identifiable information of yours is collected
We collect aggregate information site-wide, including anonymous site stats.
==========
We also log domain names and/or IP addresses.
On certain pages such as the EFF Membership Form, we give users the option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, demographic, preference and other personal information, and various other kinds of details.
==========
This more personal information is not gathered by us without users' knowing and active permission and participation.
What organization is collecting the information
The information is gathered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation itself, generally speaking.
Contact and other information about our users might be collected by third parties that fulfill orders, verify credit cards, process orders in online currencies such as First Virtual or DigiCash, etc.
These off-site assistants and fulfillment houses will be required by us to make no further use of such information, nor disclose it to others, just like in-house EFF employees.
==========
How the information is used
We review and discard the information in some cases (e.g. IP address logs for file transfers), while in others we may use the information to tailor our users' web experience, generate anonymous statistics, or to contact users via email or postal mail (e.g. to send newsletters, action alerts, pledge drive promotions, etc.) Personal information that has been volunteered to us may also be combined with data from third parties, such as Congressional district maps, to improve our services to members.
No such combining will be done for marketing purposes.
If the user permits, we may also share the information with other, similar, non-profit orgainizations.
==========
This option is "off" by default.
With whom the information may be shared
EFF may share (but to date has not shared) members' contact information, only with permission, to similar non-profit organizations.
==========
This operates on an opt-in basis (i.e. your information will not be shared in this way unless you personally allow it.)
What choices are avaialble to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
Our opt-out policy is that you may opt out of any use by us of information you have provided to us (and in fact you have to opt in voluntarily for any such use to happen in the first place.)
Our delete/deactivate policy is the same as our opt-out policy - if you want to be removed from our membership roster, mailing lists or other databases, just let us know.
If you would like to opt-out of any use of your personally identifiable information by us, or be removed from this site's database, please contact:
Membership Dir.
