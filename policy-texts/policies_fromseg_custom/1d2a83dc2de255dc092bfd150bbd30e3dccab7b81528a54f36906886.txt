Privacy  















Our Commitment to Client Privacy


 The members of Royal Bank Financial Group—Royal Bank, Royal Trust, Action Direct, Royal Mutual Funds, RBC Dominion Securities and RBC Insurance—and their employees are committed to respecting the confidentiality of clients' personal, business and financial information.
Client information refers to data that identifies or relates to a client, whether the client is an individual or a company.
It includes information such as name, address, age, gender,






identification numbers, assets, liabilities, income, payment records, health records and driving record.
In the case of a business client, it includes the above data plus names of officers/directors/owners/shareholders, fiscal year end, jurisdiction of incorporation, financial information, and the ownership structure and organization of the business.
RBC Insurance may also require the names of the employees of its business clients.
To ensure the commitment to client privacy is upheld, we have developed a Privacy Code which governs the behaviour of employees and suppliers with regard to the accuracy, confidentiality and security of all client information.

We also endorse and observe the privacy guidelines issued by the Federal Government, applicable provincial requirements, the Canadian Standards Association and the Canadian Bankers Association.
