WHAT IS A COOKIE?
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers downloaded on to your computer when you access certain websites.
Like virtual door keys, cookies unlock a computer’s memory and allow a website to recognize users when they return to a site by opening doors to different content or services.
Like a key, a cookie itself does not contain information, but when it is read by a browser it can help a website improve the service delivered.
Cookie files are automatically lodged into the cookie file – the memory of your browser – and each one typically contains:
• The name of the server the cookie was sent from
• The lifetime of the cookie
• A value – usually a randomly generated unique number
The website server which sent the cookie uses this number to recognize you when you return to a site or browse from page to page.
Only the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie.

These cookies are set by third parties and we do not control how they are set.

SameSite cookies may not be supported by all browsers.
The types of cookies that may be used on our Services fall into one of four categories as follows:
• ‘Strictly Necessary’ Cookies.

==========

This is often called online behavioral advertising (OBA) and involves the monitoring of interests based upon web browsing history.
Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (for example, your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you.
Although behavioral advertising cookies can track your activity around the internet they cannot identify you personally, even if you are signed in to our Services.
==========
