Privacy Statement
MLB Advanced Media, L.P. is the organization that produces the Official Website of Major League Baseball (the "Website").
We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.
This Privacy Policy is applicable to this Website.
General
You can visit and enjoy our Website without disclosing any personal information about yourself.
However, we offer some special services, and for these services to work properly we will need you to share with us certain personal information about yourself.
==========
The personal information we collect may include, but is not limited to, first and last name, street address, e-mail address, telephone number (e.g., home, work, mobile and/or fax), and birthdate.
We may also collect other personal information that will be identified on the applicable page(s) of the Website.
If you submit any personal information to us, or to our third party service providers acting on our behalf, you can be assured that we will not sell, lease, or share your personal information with or to anyone else, except as follows: (1) to our third party service providers, and only so that they may help us provide the services you've requested and in certain circumstances to provide you with ticket related offers; (2) to one or more Major League Baseball Clubs, to the extent that you've submitted information that relates specifically to them (e.g., you've asked to receive the newsletter of one or more Clubs via email; or you've purchased Club-specific merchandise from the store), so that they may learn more about fans like you, and provide better services to you; (3) upon notice posted on an applicable location of our Website where we collect your personal information for an economic transaction and notify you that we will be sharing such information with a third party (i.e., ESPN.com), where such third party is clearly identified; and (4) on occasion, we may offer a special promotion (such as a sweepstakes, contest, fantasy baseball or a free subscription to goods and services) on the Website in conjunction with a third party service provider, sponsor or promotional partner, and share your information with that sponsor or promotional partner so that it can send you other special promotions it offers, but only if you give us permission to do so.
Special Offers and Promotions.
With your permission, we may also send you e-mails with special offers and promotions.
If you don't want to receive these, you may change your preferences.
Information Automatically Collected.
==========
We use automatic methods such as cookies (small amounts of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive) and single-pixel GIF images alone or in combination with personally identifiable information you choose to provide us, to make our Website work better, to understand Website usage and trends, deliver a more personalized experience and to improve our content and offerings.
Examples of the information we collect and analyze using such methods include, without limitation, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; e-mail address; login name and password; type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we may aggregate with similar information from other customers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, on, and from our Website, including date and time; cookie information; products you viewed or searched for; and your purchase history.
We may also use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
We may use also to enable you to use a "shopping cart" if you want to purchase goods or services while on our Website, and to offer you products, programs, or services based on purchase and Website usage behavior that you and/or other customers have exhibited.
==========
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to accept or reject cookies.
If you set your browser not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain services on our Website.
We do not transfer cookies associated with our Website to any other company, nor do we authorize any other company to access the cookies we have placed on your computer's hard drive.
We may allow other companies that are presenting advertisements or providing services on our pages to set and access cookies on your computer.
Those companies' use of cookies will be covered by their own privacy policies, not ours.
==========
We do not install any spyware or adware in connection with our Website, or distribute any commercial message, or authorize any third party to distribute any commercial message, by means of spyware or adware.
"Spyware" or "adware" is any software which has been downloaded to and/or installed on an Internet user's computer, without the user's actual consent, and facilitates the distribution of any commercial message to the user.
If you feel you may have spyware from another company installed on your machine, there are various anti-spyware/adware software applications available on the Internet to identify if this has occurred.
==========
We use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit certain pages of our Website.
This company may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our Website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
If you would like more information about the information collection practices of this third-party advertising company, click here.
==========
Aggregated Demographic Information.
We may share aggregated demographic information with third parties, but this information is not linked to any personal information that can identify you or another individual person.
Therefore, no personal information is disclosed in this manner.
==========
Business Transfers.
As time passes, MLB Advanced Media, L.P. may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which customer information is one of the business assets transferred.
In such a case, the customer information which we have gathered may be one of the business assets we transfer.
==========
Disclosure for Legal Purposes.
The law requires that we may be required to share your personal information and non-personal information (see "Cookies" section above for examples of non-personal information) pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or orders.
If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the law.
In addition, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to use and disclose share your personal and non-personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Website's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
==========

Your preferences are password protected for your privacy and security.
In certain areas, we use industry-standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions.

==========
Links
Our Website contains links to other sites produced by MLB Advanced Media, L.P. and websites operated by unrelated third parties.
Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites.
We encourage you to be aware of this when your leave our Website and to read the privacy policies of every website that collects personally identifiable information from you.
The Privacy Policy applies only to this Website.
==========
Special Rules For Children
Because of federal law, we cannot collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that child's parent.
The statements in this Privacy Policy generally about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, with the added protection of the special rules that follow.
Parental Consent
Some services on the Website (e.g., Shop, Ticketing, Auctions) require the submission of a credit card number along with personal information, and are therefore not available to children.
Other services on the Website (e.g., fantasy baseball) are not available to children under the age of thirteen.
For services that are available to children under the age of thirteen, if a child under the age of thirteen attempts to complete any registration form on the Website a screen will appear that says "Get Your Mom or Dad."
==========
We will then instruct the child to have a parent complete the registration form, either in person or by e-mail.
We will provide the parent with a notice describing the Privacy Policy and will ask for the parent's consent to our collection and use of personal information from or about their child.
The parent will also be asked to submit a credit card number (the card will not be charged) for verification purposes only.
If the registration form is not completed with a credit card number to verify parental consent, the child will not be able to access those of our activities requiring registration and we will not collect any personal information from that child.
Failure to complete the registration form will also prevent the child from entering chat rooms or otherwise making personal information available to the public on the Website.
A child's parent has the option to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties, but if such disclosure is necessary to make available a service which has been requested, then the child will not have access to such service.
==========
Information Collected.
Depending on the special service requested, personal information collected may include a name, email address, address or age of a child.
We will not condition a child's participation in any activity on the Website, such as fantasy baseball, on the child's disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
A parent can review his or her child's personal information by accessing the child's preferences.
A parent can instruct us to delete the child's personal information or to stop collecting or using the child's personal information by contacting the Privacy Administrator.
Information Use.
==========
We may use the personal information to provide the child with the special services for which he or she has registered, as well as for fulfilling a requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child or making it publicly available through a chat room.
(Please note that when anyone, including a child, uses a message board or chat room on our Website, the communications are publicly available to the other participants.)
Information Disclosure.
After obtaining the consent of the child's parent, we, our service providers, and one or more Clubs (to the extent that any information disclosed is specific to them), will maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected about the child.
A child's information will only be disclosed to our third party service providers and the applicable Club(s) as described in this Privacy Policy.
The following are third party service providers of our services which may collect or maintain personal information from children under 13 on our behalf: Synacor, Inc. (vanity e-mail); and Prospero, Inc. (message boards and GameDay chat).
They can't use your child's personal information without your consent for any purpose other than the service you've requested on behalf of your child.
