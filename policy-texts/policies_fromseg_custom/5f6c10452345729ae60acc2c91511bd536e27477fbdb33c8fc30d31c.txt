Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a site.
A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site.

We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the DAA opt-out link above.
