Service providers to whom we disclose personal information must agree to contractual requirements consistent with our privacy and security policies.

How may you limit the sharing of your information?
You may limit or "opt-out" of our sharing your personal information with non-affiliated third parties for their marketing purposes.
However, we do not currently share your personal information with any non-affiliated third party in a manner that triggers this opt-out right.
Accordingly, there is no need at this time for you to opt-out or take any other action telling us not to share such information with non-affiliated third parties.
You may also opt-out of our sharing certain personal information (e.g., information other than your transactions and experiences with us such as your credit report) among our affiliated companies.
However, we only share information about your transactions and experiences (e.g., account balance, trading activity, loan amount, and account history) with our affiliated companies.
Therefore, there is no need at this time for you to exercise your opt-out right.
==========
Finally, you may also limit certain kinds of marketing from our affiliated companies.
You may elect to restrict our affiliated companies from marketing their products or services to you based on information about you that we share with them.
Since our affiliated companies engage in such marketing from time to time, we are providing you with the ability to opt-out so that you do not receive these marketing communications in the future.To limit these marketing offers, please contact us by using the mail or telephone contact information provided below.
Your choice to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies will apply until you tell us otherwise.
You may change your opt-out status at any time.
For consumers with joint accounts, an opt-out direction by one joint account holder will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint account holders.

Where do we store personal information?
The personal information that we collect from you will be stored in the United States and other countries that may have different privacy laws and standards than those in your country of residence.
Your personal information may be transferred to or processed in the United States by us or a third party service provider working for us, or for one of our affiliates or suppliers.
By submitting personal information via our website or other means, you agree to such storage, transfers and processing.
==========
Some or all of your personal information provided to third party service providers may be held in countries other than your own, including in particular the United States.
You acknowledge and understand that your personal information will be subject to the applicable laws of each such jurisdiction, which may not provide for the same protection as your country of residence.
For example, government entities in the United States and other countries may have certain rights to access your personal information.
If you have questions about our policies and practices with respect to service providers outside your jurisdiction, including the collection, use, disclosure or storage of such personal information by our service providers worldwide, and you are entitled by applicable law to be provided this information, you may contact our Chief Privacy Officer by e-mail at CPO@etrade.com.

We use "interest-based" ads also known as "online behavioral advertising."
We may partner with ad networks and other advertising providers ("Advertising Providers") who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites.
Some of these ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information E*TRADE and Advertising Providers collect about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time.
You may visit http://www.aboutads.info/ to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") self-regulatory program.
Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.
It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

We may deny or restrict access or deny your request to change your personal information for legally permissible reasons, such as situations where the information contains references to other individuals and is not reasonably severable, where it cannot be disclosed for legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons, or where we have your personal information in our capacity as a third party administrative record keeper.
We will advise you of any reason for denying or restricting an access request to the extent permitted by law, rule or regulation.
