Payment for the first billing period in the amount shown to you at the time of purchase (plus applicable taxes) will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase, and because your subscription automatically renews, payment for each additional billing period (plus applicable taxes) will then be charged at the start of each additional billing period, unless you cancel your subscription.
