Supply Chain Transparency
In compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, Select Comfort is required to disclose its efforts to eliminate slavery and human trafficking from its global supply chain.
Select Comfort's efforts in this regard include providing employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on human trafficking and slavery.
Additionally, internal accountability standards and procedures are maintained for employees or contractors failing to meet Select Comfort standards regarding slavery and trafficking.
==========
Select Comfort employees periodically evaluate the Company's product supply chain and, as necessary, address any risks of human trafficking and slavery.
Select Comfort does not perform audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with Select Comfort standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains.
Instead, direct suppliers who provide materials incorporated into Select Comfort's products are required to certify that these materials comply with the slavery and human trafficking laws of the countries in which they do business.
