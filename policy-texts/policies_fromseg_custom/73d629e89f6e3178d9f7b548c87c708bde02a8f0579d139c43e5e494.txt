If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or Services.
What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy?
This Privacy Policy discloses our personal information gathering and dissemination practices with respect to the Site and Services.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
We have also created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy.
We recognize that when you provide us with information about yourself that you trust us to act in a responsible manner with that information, and we’re committed to making sure we earn that trust.
Consent
By using the Service or submitting personal information through the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy.
==========
We process the personal information we obtain on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries.
In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country.
Laws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
==========
Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), we may in the future.
We may share some or all of your personal information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
In the event Embedly goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets to which this Privacy Policy relates, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur.
==========
What information do we collect from users and how is it used?
The following describes the types of personal and other information we may collect about you, and how we use and maintain that information:
Information collected online can generally be categorized as either non-personal information or personally identifiable information.
Non-personal information is information that cannot by itself be traced back to a specific individual.
==========
For example, we know how many calls or queries we receive each day but we do not know the names and email addresses of the persons submitting the queries.
Personally identifiable information is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, such as your name or email address.
We do not associate any non-personal information we collect from you, including your search queries and IP address, with the personally identifiable information that you may submit to us.
For this reason, we do not consider your IP address to be personally identifiable information.
Registration
Before you can utilize certain Services that we offer on the Site or otherwise, we may ask that you register with Embedly and provide us with your email address, a password, your first and last name and other contact information and personal details.
We request this information for identification purposes, to communicate with you regarding your account, and to facilitate the functioning of certain Services.
==========
We may keep this information indefinitely.
Correspondence
If you correspond with us via email, we may gather in a file specific to you the information that you submit.
We may keep this information indefinitely.
==========
URL and IP address
Like many other websites, Embedly collects information about users’ utilization and navigation of our Site.
This information helps us to design our Site to better suit our users’ needs.
For example, our Site will track the URL that you visited before you came to our Site, the URL to which you next go, your Internet Protocol (IP) address and any URLs to which you link using the Services.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site.
Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
==========
Information Collected With Cookies
Like most major websites, Embedly may use cookies on certain pages of our Site.
Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you.
For example, a cookie lets a Site remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently while visiting our Site.
==========
We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests.
Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site.
If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as it would be if the cookie were enabled.
==========
The information that we collect with cookies allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site’s content, layout and services.
However, we only use information collected with cookies on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you.
To whom does Embedly disclose information about you that we collect?
Embedly will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose any of the personally identifiable information that we collect about you, except when we have your permission or in any of the following situations:

What security measures does the Site employ?
To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through this Site, where personally identifiable information is requested, Embedly uses technology designed to encrypt the information that you input before it is sent to us.
In addition, Embedly takes steps to protect the user data we collect against unauthorized access.
However, you should keep in mind that this Site and our Services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.
==========
Embedly takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information that you share and that we store.
We restrict access to personal information only to Embedly employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services.
These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
However, no security system can be fully secured; accordingly, Embedly cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide to us in connection with the delivery of our Services.
Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this Privacy Policy, no data transmission over the Internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
