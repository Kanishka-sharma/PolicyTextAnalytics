==========
CNBC.com’s Privacy Policy Your privacy on the Internet is important to us.
As part of the operation of CNBC.com, we gather certain types of information about CNBC.com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.
Information Collected By CNBC.com CNBC.com collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal information (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated information (such as information about traffic patterns on CNBC.com, for example how many users log into CNBC.com on a daily basis).
Personal Information Personal information is collected when users provide personal information to CNBC.com, for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, creating a personal portfolio, answering surveys, purchasing items from CNBC.com, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by CNBC.com.
Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to our message boards and chat areas.
Aggregated Information Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods.
For example, CNBC.com collects IP addresses.
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web.
==========
Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from CNBC.com, our servers log your IP address.
CNBC.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on CNBC.com.
Use of Cookies CNBC.com uses "cookies" to collect information.
