Thank you for visiting the Florida Department of Transportation Web site.
Your privacy is very important to us.
Simply stated, our policy is to collect no personal
    information about you when you visit our Web site unless you affirmatively choose to make
    such information available to us.
When you visit our Web site, our Web server
    automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed
    our Web site.
This information does not result in the identification of your personal
    e-mail address or other personal information.
In addition, we gather information regarding the volume and timing of access to our Web
    site by collecting information on the date, time and Web site pages accessed by visitors
    to the Web site.
We do this so that we can improve the content of our Web site, and this
    information is not shared with other organizations.
Again, only aggregate information is
    collected, and individual visitors' personal information is not identified.
If you choose to share personal information with us - sending us a message or filling
    out an electronic form with personal information - we will use the information only for
    the purposes you authorized.
==========
Some of the information may be saved for a designated period
    of time to comply with Florida's archiving policies, but we will not disclose the
    information to third parties or other government agencies, unless required to do so by
    state or federal law.
And if we are required to disclose information about you by law, we
    will make every effort to notify you of the disclosure in advance.
If you have other questions about our privacy
    policies, or have ideas about improving our policies, please feel free to e-mail us at fdot.pio@dot.state.fl.us, or you can reach us
