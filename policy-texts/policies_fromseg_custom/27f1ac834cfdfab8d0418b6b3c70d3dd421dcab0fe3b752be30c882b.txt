RightNow Technologies, Inc. is committed to your privacy.
One of the ways in which we demonstrate this commitment is through the care we take to protect the privacy of information which we collect when we host your data on our servers, or on the servers of our sub-contractors.
==========
/
While many of our customers choose to host our software products on their own servers, many others choose to contract with us to host their RightNow Web-pages.
We typically purchase or lease servers, which we then install in state of the art data centers operated by leading web hosting companies.
Currently, we utilize web hosting services and data center facilities operated by Exodus Communications at 2831 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, CA 95054-1838 and Up2 Technologies at 1000, de la Gauchetiere Street West, Montreal (Quebec) Canada H3B 4X5.
==========
RightNow Technologies has entered into binding legal agreements with both of these companies, with the objective (among others) of protecting your privacy, and the privacy of the people who use our software.
This Hosting Privacy Policy Statement is directed to those of our customers who choose to host through RightNow Technologies, Inc.
Whenever the term "Customer Information" is used in this Statement, we mean information about your end users stored by us or our sub-contracted hosting companies.
We promise that we will not use Customer Information for the purposes of marketing to, or otherwise communicating directly with your end users.
==========
Nor will we give that information to a third party, unless we are required to do so in order to comply with the law.
The only use which we will make of Customer Information is to host your data in accordance with the hosting agreement to which both of us are a party.
If you feel that RightNow is not abiding by this Statement, you should contact us by addressing your concerns to privacy@rightnow.com.

Cookies
A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website of one party to the hard drive of another party's computer, enabling the first party to track the website activities of the other party.
We do not issue any cookies which enable third parties to track the activities of your end users.
Our software uses cookies which allow you to track those activities.
However, we have designed our software to give you total control over the duration of those cookies.
==========
Security
All hosted environments meet the following physical security requirements - Single point of entry to hosting areas; main access monitored with additional access for emergency purposes only; surveillance cameras in facility; access validation with identity check; access only to persons on RightNow approved access list.
All hosted environments also meet the following electronic security conditions - log-in validation; creation of accounts only as verified by RightNow or sub-contracted hosting provider; secure SSH (encrypted) connections to access servers; servers running behind secure firewall.
==========
One of the options we offer is Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
If you implement our SSL option, we will not transmit Customer Information for the particular user interface that has the SSL over the public internet "in the clear", i.e., without it first being encrypted.
All hosted data is backed up once in every 24 hours.
==========
RightNow imposes strict internal controls over those of its employees, contractors and consultants with access to Customer Information.
Such access is granted only on a need to know basis.
Correction/Updating of Customer Information
Our software is configured so as to enable you to give your end users the means to access their own personal information for the purposes of deleting it, and/or correcting it either through on-line or off-line means.
==========
European Data Protection Directive

We will also give you contractual undertakings to comply with all reasonable technical and organizational measures necessary to keep such personal data secure and to protect it against accidental loss or unlawful destruction, alteration, disclosure or access; and to deal with the information only in accordance with your reasonable and lawful instructions.
