To use Google My Business or any service for Google My Business claimed businesses (the “Google My Business Services”), you must accept (1) the Google Terms of Service, and (2) these Google My Business Additional Terms of Service (the “Google My Business Additional Terms”).
Please read each of these documents carefully.
Together, these documents are known as the “Terms”.
==========
They establish what you can expect from us as you use the Google My Business Services, and what we expect from you.
If these Google My Business Additional Terms conflict with the Google Terms of Service, these Google My Business Additional Terms will govern for the Google My Business Services.
Important: As a precaution in light of COVID-19, we're operating with a limited team.

Ensure that your content is correct, up to date, and complete.

Your content
While Google is not responsible for your Business Profile or the entity listed on your Business Profile, once you have claimed, you understand that we have the right, but not the obligation, to moderate the content that you provide to your Business Profile using Google My Business Services.
We’re constantly striving to ensure that information in your Business Profile is complete, relevant and up-to-date, so that the business details displayed on Google are as useful as possible for you and our users.
This means that occasionally, we may choose not to display your content (for example, if trusted signals indicate that your content is not accurate), or we may choose to show only an edited version of your content or to show content from an alternative source in place of your content.
