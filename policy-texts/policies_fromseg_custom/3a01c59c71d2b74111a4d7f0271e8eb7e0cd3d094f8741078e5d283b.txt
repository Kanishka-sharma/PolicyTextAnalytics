About Evidon data collection
To help our system remember the preferences you set explicitly at Evidon (for example, opt-out selections) and to provide aggregate statistics to our clients about their privacy notices, we collect information about your selections and other interactions with our privacy web applications.
We may store basic information about your choices in cookies or similar technologies, but this information is never shared with any third party.
If you request a change to your preferences with a company (for example, an opt-out choice), we will send this request to your specified company for processing.
The information we provide to clients is always provided in aggregate form, and includes basic reporting metrics like the number of consumers interacting with their privacy notices and the choices consumers, in aggregate, are making through these notices.
