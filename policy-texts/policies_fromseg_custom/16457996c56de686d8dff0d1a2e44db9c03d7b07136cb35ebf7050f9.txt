Cookies
Cookies are small text files stored by your web browser when you use websites.
You can control how websites use cookies by configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to your browser's help function to learn more about cookie controls).
Note that if you disable cookies entirely, Adobe websites may not function properly.
Adobe and the companies that help us run our business use cookies in several ways, such as:
Authenticating and identifying you on our websites so we can provide you the services you requested
Keeping track of information you have provided to us — for example, keeping items in your shopping cart as you browse Adobe.com
Providing you the Adobe websites that you use
Remembering your preferences or where you left off in your use of an Adobe website
Measuring your use of Adobe websites so that we can improve them, tailor our websites to your likely interests, and conduct market research (learn more or opt out)
Understanding your likely interests so we can provide you more relevant Adobe ads and content on non-Adobe websites and in non-Adobe apps (learn more or opt out)
Running the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions that help our business customers personalize and improve the performance of their websites, apps, and marketing messages (learn more or opt out).
Technologies similar to cookies
Technically speaking, cookies are called “HTTP cookies.”
==========
There are other technologies that can be used for similar purposes, such as HTML5 Local Storage and local shared objects (LSOs).
LSOs are used by the authors of files that are read by Adobe® Flash® Player and the websites hosting those files (learn more about Flash Player and LSOs).
We may use HTML5 Local Storage, LSOs, and similar technologies for authenticating you, keeping track of information you have provided to us, and remembering your preferences (see bullet points above).
==========
When you are using an Adobe application offline, we may store information related to how you used that website on your device and then transfer it to our servers the next time you connect online to our service.
Web beacons and embedded scripts
Web beacons and embedded scripts are other technologies that we use in our websites, as well as in some of our emails and ads.
Web beacons (or “tags”) are bits of programming code included in web pages, emails, and ads that notify Adobe (or the companies that help us run our business) when those web pages, emails, or ads have been viewed or clicked on.
Embedded scripts are bits of programming code included within some of our web pages that measure how you use those web pages, such as which links you click.
==========
We use this information to improve our websites, tailor our websites to your likely interests, and conduct market research.
You may be able to turn off scripting functionality, such as JavaScript, within your browser (please refer to your browser's help function).
Note that if you disable scripting functionality, some Adobe websites may not function properly.
