	identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, billing information, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this
	personal information.

send communications and administrative emails about the Services;
personalize and better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services for your use;

Log Data.
When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information from your device ("Log Data").
This Log Data may include 
	    information such as your computer's Internet protocol address (more commonly known as an IP address), browser type, the webpages you visit, the time 
	    spent on those pages, access times and dates, and other statistics as well as the unique identifier for your computer, mobile phone or any other

	    and to better tailor them to the needs of our users and to provide better service to other users.
We also use this information to verify that visitors
	    to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests.
We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with 
	    other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information.
==========
Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your browser for
	    record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies for two purposes.
First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your registration information.
Second, we
	    utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate
	    usage and web traffic routing on the Services.
==========
Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services
	    and then close your browser.
Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser.
You can instruct your browser, by
	    changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, 
	    however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Services.
==========
Any Personal Information gathered through the use of cookies is 
	    subject to the same efforts to protect your privacy as outlined above.
How We Share and Disclose Information
	We know how important it is to keep the information you've entrusted to us confidential.
We will not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with
	third parties except as specifically approved or under the circumstances described below.
If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information 
	collected about you in the ways identified in this Notice, you should not use the Services.
Users.
Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want Hola, other Hola users, and third parties to know about you.
==========
We recommend that you guard your anonymity and Personal Information and we encourage you to think carefully about what Personal Information you disclose 
	    in your profile pages and in any forums or any other part of the Services.
Service Providers.
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate or enhance our Services, to provide the Services on our
	    behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services) or to assist
	    us in analyzing how our Services are used.
These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are 
	    obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Affiliate Site or Service.
When you access a website or communicate with or use an application (mobile or otherwise) operated by any entity
	    other than us (e.g., the iTunes App Store, a social networking site like Facebook or Twitter, one of our sponsors, venues or promoters), we call that 
	    website or service an Affiliate Site or Service.
Unless we clearly indicate otherwise at the time of collection, we do not share Personal Information
	    with Affiliate Sites or Service.
Please be aware however that our Affiliate Sites or Service may collect information about you.
By the mere virtue of 
	    your presence on the Affiliate Site or Service, the Affiliate Site or Service may be able to collect information about you and/or the way you interact 
	    with the Affiliate Site or use the Affiliate Service.
==========
These might include for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity.
There may
	    be a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page.
Any Personal Information that you provide when you sign up at any co-branded page may be
	    collected by, or shared with, our third party Affiliate.
Please see the Affiliate Siteâ€™s privacy policy to better understand what information is collected,
	    how it is used and shared, and your choices regarding control.
==========
Aggregated, Anonymous Information.
We may share aggregated Anonymous Information about you with third parties.
Aggregated information is your
	    Anonymous Information that is combined with the Anonymous Information of other users and does not allow you to be identified or contacted.
Depending on the
	    circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregated information, or limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.
We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties
	    as we in good faith believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to comply with applicable
	    laws, to protect the property and rights of Hola, you or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we 
	    may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
==========
Within our Company; Changes to our Company.
We may share all or some of your Personal Information with any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures, 
	    or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Notice.
Additionally, in the event we go through a business transition
	    such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred.
You
	    acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Notice, and that any entity that acquires us, is merged with us or that acquires our assets
	    may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Notice.
==========
Children's Information
	The Services are not directed or intended for children under 13 years of age.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from individuals under
	13 years of age.
No one under age 13 may provide any Personal Information to or on the Services.
If you are under 13 years of age, you should not register or provide
	Personal Information through the Services.
If we later obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal
	Information from our systems.
==========
If you are the parent or guardian of a child whom you believe has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at info@hola.org 
	so that we may delete and remove such child's information from our systems.
We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the internet 
	and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices.
If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us via email at info@hola.org.
==========
Social Media and Online Engagement 
	We use a variety of technologies and social media options to communicate and interact with our users.
These sites and applications include popular social networking
	and media sites, open source software communities and more.
To better engage the public in ongoing dialog, we use several third-party platforms including, but not
	limited to, Facebook and Twitter.
"Third-Party Websites and Applications" are Web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by us.
==========
When
	interacting with the Hola presence on those websites, you may reveal certain Personal Information to us or to third parties.
Ad Networks and Third Party Cookies
	We may have agreements with companies, sometimes called "Ad Networks" that serve advertising on the Services on behalf of third parties.
These Ad Networks may place
	or recognize a "third party cookie," on your browser.
Ad Networks use cookies to understand Web usage patterns of people who see advertisements, to control the sequence
	of advertisements you see, to provide you with the most relevant advertising, and to make sure you don't see the same ad too many times.
==========
Ad Networks may connect
	information about pages you visit through our Services with information about pages you visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information.
We do not control Ad Networks or what they do with the information they collect.
Many Ad Networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and abide by NAI 
	principles, which prohibit members from connecting Personal Information to information they collect through cookies without your explicit consent.
If you wish to opt out
	of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI member Ad Networks, please go to the NAI Opt-Out [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp] site
	and follow the instructions on that site.
After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements from NAI member Ad Networks, but the advertising will not be tailored to
	your web preferences and usage patterns.
==========
Security and Data Retention
	Hola is very concerned with safeguarding your information.
We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from 
	unauthorized access.
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically 
	stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Services in the most
	expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to
	determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the Internet,
	we make commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of such information consistent with this Notice and all applicable laws and regulations.
We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws and your
	consent to such purpose remains valid after termination of our relationship with you.
==========
Your Choices
	Remember, you have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Information:
	
Limit the Personal Data You Provide.
If you choose not to provide any Personal Information or limit the Personal Information you provide, you may not be 
	    able to use certain Services.
Opt-Out.
==========
When you supply us with Personal Information, from time-to-time, in our discretion, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in
	    receiving information from us about special offers in connection with the Services, and/or our advertisers and partners.
Unless you opt-out to receive such 
	    communications, we may, from time to time, send you marketing communications.
At any time, you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by clicking on your email preferences and following the instructions to
	    "manage your email alerts."
==========
You may modify your choices at any time.
Also, in any promotional email we send, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving
	    such messages in the future by clicking on the link at the bottom of the email that says "unsubscribe."
It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.
Even if you have unsubscribed from receiving promotional emails from us, we may send you other types of important e-mail communications without offering you the opportunity
	    to opt out of receiving them.
==========
These may include customer service announcements, administrative notices and surveys.
Please note that changing information in registration account or opting out of receiving promotional email communications will affect only future communications from us.
If we already provided your information to a third party (such as a sponsor or affiliate) before you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to 
	    change your preferences directly with that third party as well.
Changing or Deleting Your Information.
You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your profile by changing the applicable
	    information in your account settings.
Keep in mind, however, that even if you delete information from your profile, we may retain your Personal Information in 
	    conformance with our data retention policy and there may be residual Personal Information that remains within our databases, access logs, and other records.
In 
	    addition, we are not responsible for updating or removing your Personal Information contained in the lists or databases of third parties who have been provided 
	    information as permitted by this Notice.
