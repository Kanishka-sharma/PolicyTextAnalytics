Improve performance and stability for users everywhere
Interaction data: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows; number of webpages visited; number and type of installed Firefox Add-ons; and session length) and Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals).
Technical data: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us.
When Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

==========
Recommend relevant content
Firefox displays content, such as Add-on Recommendations, Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Firefox users), and Pocket Recommendations (which is part of the Mozilla family).
Location data: Firefox uses your IP address to suggest relevant content based on your country and state.
Technical & Interaction data: Firefox sends us data such as the position, size and placement of content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with content.

==========
Pocket Recommendations: We recommend content to you based on your browsing history, language, and country location.
The process of deciding which stories you should see based on your browsing history happens locally in your copy of Firefox, and neither Mozilla nor Pocket receives a copy of your browsing history.
==========
To help you see relevant Pocket Recommendations based on your location, Firefox shares your language and country location with Pocket.
Mozilla and Pocket receive aggregated data about the recommendations you see and click.
We also share aggregated data about the sponsored content you see and click with our third-party ad platform Adzerk so advertisers can see how many people click on their articles.
This aggregated data does not identify you personally.
Top Sites: When you click on a Sponsored Top Sites tile on New Tab, we share your country, region, county (if you're in the US), and the time you clicked with AdMarketplace (a third-party referral platform) to verify you navigated to the website.
==========
Firefox does not share your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you.
Add-on and Feature Recommendations: We recommend Add-ons in two places: the Manage Your Extensions Page (about:addons) and the Awesome Bar, where you search or type in URLs.
We may also recommend Firefox Features in the Awesome Bar.
==========
We base the recommendations in about:addons on a cookie.
We base the recommendations in the Awesome Bar on your interaction with Firefox.
Mozilla does not receive your browser history.
The process happens locally in your own computer’s copy of Firefox.
Learn More about Awesome Bar recommendations or Extensions Page recommendations.

Improve security for users everywhere
Webpage data to DNS Resolver service: For some Firefox users in the United States, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla’s strict privacy standards for resolvers.
