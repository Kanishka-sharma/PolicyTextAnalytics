Your privacy is critically important to us.
At Brainflare we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
==========
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
Brainflare, Inc. ("Brainflare") operates several websites including brainflare.com, quizlet.com.
It is Brainflare's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Brainflare collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Brainflare’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Brainflare’s visitors use its website.
From time to time, Brainflare may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
==========
Brainflare also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
Brainflare does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Brainflare's websites choose to interact with Brainflare in ways that require Brainflare to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Brainflare gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
==========
For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Quizlet to provide a username and email address.
Those who engage in transactions with Brainflare are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
In each case, Brainflare collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Brainflare.
Brainflare does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Children
Quizlet.com is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Brainflare discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Brainflare's behalf or to provide services available at Brainflare's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Brainflare's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Brainflare will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Brainflare discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Brainflare believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Brainflare, third parties or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of a Brainflare website and have supplied your email address, Brainflare may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Brainflare and our products.
==========
We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
Brainflare takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
