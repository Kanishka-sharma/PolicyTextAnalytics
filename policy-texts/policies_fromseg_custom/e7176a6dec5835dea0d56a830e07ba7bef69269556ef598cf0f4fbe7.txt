General
YouCanBookMe limited ("we" or "us") take the privacy of your information very seriously.
Our Privacy and Data Protection Notice is designed to tell you, the user of our availability and booking service ("Service") about our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal and other information about you or your business that may be provided via this website or collected through our booking form or otherwise.
This privacy notice applies to information provided by our members and account holders ("members") and also applies to information which is processed by us when a person (referred to for convenience as a "Customer") books an appointment or submits data using our Service.
==========
This privacy notice is prepared in compliance with applicable data protection legislation including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the Data Protection Act 2018 and the retained EU law version of the GDPR (“UK GDPR”).
Important Note: If you are using our Service to make a booking with our member or account holder ("account holder") please note that we are a processor of that data but we are not the data controller.
We will pass the data you provide onto our account holder in accordance with this privacy notice.
Our Policy
We aim to limit our interaction with your data wherever possible.
We have a general policy relating to access to your data.
We will generally seek only to access that data which is necessary in accordance with the privileges you have granted to the system.
==========
Automated processes may scan your data, but only for an explicit purpose to do with the management of your bookings or delivery of other services.
When working with data that was originally collected by us, our processes may need to scan and manipulate the information in order to deliver our service to you.
==========
We have systems in place which allow you to limit and control the access you allow to your calendar data.
However when working with data or content that was not collected by us and which originated elsewhere (e.g. private information you may have entered on your calendar) our policy is to only access and process a limited amount of outline data which we need to deliver the service to you (e.g. your 'free/busy' times).
We will not review and analyse content.
==========
Occasionally, to assist with troubleshooting problems you are experiencing with the system, we will seek your permission to access your data.
Our policy is always to minimise the instances that this occurs, judge the necessity on a case-by-case basis, not to automate this process and only to do so with the knowledge and permission of the owner of the data.
==========
Basis on which we process personal data
Personal data we hold about you will be processed either because:
the processing is necessary in order for us to deliver our Service (i.e. to comply with our obligations under the contract between us and our account holder);
the processing is necessary in pursuit of a “legitimate interest”, a legitimate interest in this context means a valid interest we have or a third party has in processing your personal data which is not overridden by your interests in data privacy and security;
the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation; or
in certain limited circumstances because you have consented to the processing for specific purposes.
Personal data we collect
We may collect and process the following personal information or data (information that can be uniquely identified with you) about you:
Log-In Information log-in details and information you provide as an account holder when you register with the Service;
Contact Information contact information we collect from you as an account holder about you or your employees (for example, names, addresses, contact addresses, telephone numbers and email address provided to us by you or by your employer);
Calendar Information certain information which is contained in a third party service or calendar account (e.g. Google Calendar account) which you have linked with your YouCanBook.me account, please refer to our list of processors in section 9 this policy for information about those third party services from whom we may collect data, any data we do collect from a third party service will be used strictly in accordance with this policy;

==========
We only collect such information when you choose to supply it to us.
You do not have to supply any personal information to us and you may withdraw your authority for us to process your data or request that we restrict our processing (see section 11 in this policy) but our Service may not be operable in practice without providing such data to us.
==========
Information may also be gathered through the Service without you actively providing it, through the use of various technologies and methods such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and cookies.
An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet.
We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, and determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and to administer and improve the site.
==========
If you are a customer of our account holder and our account holder has connected with us via Stripe Connect (allowing us to collect payment on the Site) then we may have access to your payment history with our account holder, even if you are not a user of the Site.
We will not seek to access nor will we process any data other than data specifically relating to our users and payments made via the Site.
==========
We will restrict access to any such information and we will also take steps to remove our access to any non-relevant data.

our data processing storage facilities are sited in secure locations to prevent unauthorised access, our infrastructure is provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and certifications for infrastructure provided by AWS can be obtained here: AWS Certifications
all communication with our servers is encrypted through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an industry standard encryption method that encrypts data between your computer and our servers so that in the event of your network being insecure no data is passed in a format that could easily be deciphered.
regular security assessments of our infrastructure are performed.
This includes web vulnerability scans, dependency vulnerability scans, static code analysis, rule based OS inspection and manual assessments.
==========
Subscriber Personal Data
There is certain information we collect for which we are not the data controller but rather a ‘data processor’, and this includes Calendar Information, Booking Information, and Booking Form Information.
Our account holder is the data controller for this data and our terms require that our account holder process this data in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.
In our Terms of Use this data is defined as “Subscriber Personal Data” and the processing of Subscriber Personal Data by us will be governed by the terms of our Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”).

sub-processors used in our capacity as a data processor and
also contains details of ‘processors in common’, i.e. if you use the Service to interact with other third party accounts or services you have, then the Service may send information to those third party services/we may communicate with them via API - we refer to these services as ‘processors in common’.
Please note that a processor in common is not a processor or sub-processor engaged by us, rather they are an independent controller or processor of data who you have authorised to share data with us.
==========
The terms on which they process a user’s personal data will be subject to the user’s separate agreement with them, and the terms of their own privacy documentation.
When we receive data from a processor in common it will be dealt with by us in accordance with the terms of this privacy notice.
