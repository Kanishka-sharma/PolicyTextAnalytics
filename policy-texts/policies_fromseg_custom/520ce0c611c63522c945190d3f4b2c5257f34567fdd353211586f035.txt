Welcome to FaithTap.com!
We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your information.
When I Upload or Post on your site, what information do you collect?
1.
==========
When you upload to our site, you give us permission to obtain it.
When you interact or upload to our site, you voluntarily give us certain information.
This can include your name, photo, email address, and any other information you provide us.
You also may give us permission to access your information in other services.
==========
For example, you may link your Facebook account to FaithTap, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts).
The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.

==========
We get technical information when you use our site.
These days, whenever you use a website, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way.
The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.
==========
Log Data.
When you use FaithTap, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our site ("logging data"), including information about your browser.
Whenever you log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to FaithTap, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used FaithTap.
==========
Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small file sent by your computer each time you visit a website).
Device Information.
In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using FaithTap on, including what type of device it is.
Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings.
For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone.
To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
==========
How do we use the information we collect?
We use the information we collect to provide our site to you and make our site better, develop new content, and protect FaithTap and our users.
We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content -- including helping you discover content on our site you might like or provide you with tailored advertising.
For example, if you've indicated that you're interested in Bible Verses, we may suggest a page dedicated to Learning about Verses.
==========
We also use the information we collect to:
•	Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like comments or prayers, happens on FaithTap), newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you.
•	Respond to your questions or comments.
==========
The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you).
We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above.
==========
We may use or store information wherever FaithTap does business, including countries outside your own.
What information do we collect?
FaithTap is a site people use to find their inspirations, make them a reality, and inspire others in the process.
When you create post a ‘FaithTap’ to a social site, anyone can view them.
You may also provide us with profile page information that that anyone can view.
•	When we have your consent.
==========
This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link from FaithTap.
For example, you can choose to share our posts on Facebook, Pinterest, Google+, or Twitter.
•	If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or FaithTap; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
