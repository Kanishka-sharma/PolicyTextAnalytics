Introduction
This is Centro Media LLC’s (“Centro”) privacy policy, and applies to our websites, services that we provide to you through our website or technology platform, and ads we display to you on other websites.
It is effective as of January 20th, 2017 (“Effective Date“).
This policy is incorporated into, and subject to, Centro’s Terms of Service.
By using Centro’s site, or any product or service offered, you acknowledge that you have read, and agree to, this policy.
==========
What is in this document?
This document provides information about our website and our digital advertising technology platforms (“Basis DSP”, “Centro Brand Exchange”) which enables our clients to buy digital advertising, and then describes our policies about data collection and use.
It also provides information on the type of data we collect and utilize when serving ads to individuals.
==========
CONSUMER OPT-OUT CHOICES
Centro supports empowering you to make informed decisions about the type of advertisements that are delivered to you online, and, as such, we are providing you the opportunity to opt out of the tailored ads delivered to you by Centro based on your interests, previous visits to other sites, and information stored in your web browser or mobile device.
If you select this option, you will still see just as many ads, but they will no longer be personalized based on the information Centro has collected, (i.e. the ads will likely be less relevant to you and your interests) and any information we have collected thus far will be dissociated from your device, thereby preventing its use.
Feel free to opt out here if you so desire:
Basis DSP
For desktop and mobile web, click here.
You can also opt out by clicking the AdChoices icon located in the top-right corner of any behaviorally targeted ad served by Centro.
==========
For mobile app:
Find your phone’s Android Advertising Identifer (for Android devices) or Apple Identifier for Advertising (for iOS devices).
On Android 6, open the Settings app and select “Google”.
Select “Ads”.
Choose “Opt out of Ads Personalization”, and make a note of your advertising ID.
In earlier versions of Android, this is found in a separate Google Settings app instead.
On iOS, open the Settings App and select “Privacy”.
Select “Advertising”, and enable “Limit Ad Tracking”.
==========
On iOS 10 and above, this will set your Identifier for Advertising to “0”, and no further action is needed, as this prevents its use.
On iOS 9 and below, for additional confidence, you may wish to download an app such as My TUNE Device to determine your Identifier for Advertising and enter it in the box below.
Enter it here:


It should also be noted that Centro is committed to industry self-regulation, and as such, is a member in good standing with the Interactive Advertising Bureau, (“IAB”) and is a participant in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) following the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Advertising, including its “AdChoices” program.
==========
