The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.

Cookies
A cookie is a text file that is stored on a user's hard drive.
It contains no personally identifiable information.
==========
One of the main purposes of this Web site is to enable users to opt out of the Online Preference Marketing (OPM) practices of the member companies of the NAI.
To enable a user to opt out, the NAI or member company must set an "opt-out cookie" on the user's browser.
At this site, the setting of that opt-out cookie occurs when the user chooses, via one of our opt-out pages, not to participate in the OPM practices of an NAI member company.
The only way that an NAI member company will be able to know that a user has chosen not to participate in OPM is if the member company can read an opt-out cookie on that user's browser.
For more information about how "opting out" works, please see the "Opt-Out" section of this site.
