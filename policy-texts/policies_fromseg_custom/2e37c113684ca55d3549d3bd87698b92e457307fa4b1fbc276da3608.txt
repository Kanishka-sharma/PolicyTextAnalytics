As permissible, we may also supplement the information you provide to us with demographic and other information (such as age or interest in photography) stored in third-party databases in order to make it more likely that marketing communications we send will be of interest to you.
How your personal information is used
Shutterstock collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.
If you subscribe to a service the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.
As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and to contact you regarding the contest or prize awards.
==========
Your personal information is also used by Shutterstock to track customer preferences and keep you informed about special offers and services of Shutterstock and selected third parties on whose behalf Shutterstock may contact you unless you opt out of receiving partner emails.
We send these partner special offers to you directly.
At no time do we share your email address with our partners.

Your choices with respect to personal information
ShutterStock recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Site.

==========
There are limited instances in which ShutterStock may divulge your personal information, including requirements of law, regulation, or litigation.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.
Protection of your personal information

The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a ShutterStock Subscriber, ShutterStock Submitter or user of any of the services on our Site is, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, classified as Registration Information.
Registration Information is protected in several ways.
==========
Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you.
This password is encrypted.
You should not divulge your password to anyone.
In addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected ShutterStock personnel and contractors have access to via password.
ShutterStock encrypts your personal information and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to ShutterStock.
==========
The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Web Site, you can send email to us at privacy@shutterstock.com.
Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on a secure server and is accessible only to selected ShutterStock personnel and contractors via password.
Since this information is not accessible by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.
==========
Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board or chat room, such as the Forum For Submitters (the "Forums"), is available to all persons accessing that location.
Your e-mail address will not automatically be posted on the Forums unless you modify the default setting to permit that.
Your e-mail address will then be available to all persons accessing the Forums.
In addition, any information that you choose to include in your profile can be viewed by all visitors to the Forums.
You can change your profile here.
==========
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site.
Shutterstock stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Your friend may contact support@shutterstock.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
