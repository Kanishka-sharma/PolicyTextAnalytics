• Under confidentiality agreements, we provide information to trusted partners working with or on behalf of Evolution Finance.
These companies may use your information to help us communicate offers from our company and our partner companies to you.
These companies, however, have no independent right to share this information.

• While responding to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or establishing or exercising our legal rights, or defending against legal claims.
• When we believe it is necessary to share information to investigate, prevent, or take action against: illegal activities, potential threats to any person's physical safety, violations against our terms of use, suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law.
• After we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.
• If another company acquires a majority stake in Evolution Finance or one of its properties (for example, CardHub.com), that company will possess the information associated with it, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
ADVERTISEMENTS
Evolution Finance displays targeted advertisements, which are based upon personal information.
Although Evolution Finance does not provide any personal information to advertisers when our visitors or clients view or interact with a targeted ad, by viewing or interacting with an ad, you are tacitly agreeing that the advertiser might possibly assume that you meet the targeting criteria used for ad-display purposes.
==========
We may allow others to "sponsor" some of your account activities, such as reviews, recommendations, status updates, and posts regarding “deals,” in order to increase the likelihood that others see them.
For example, if you apply for a new credit card, the respective credit card company may want to make sure that people who follow you see it so they can apply for it too.
If content is sponsored, it will appear accompanied by the word "Sponsored” or something similar.
Only people that could originally see the information can see the sponsored post, and no personal information about you (or your friends) is shared with the sponsor.
==========
COOKIES
• Evolution Finance may set and access Evolution Finance cookies on your computer.
• Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Evolution Finance's cookies.
• Evolution Finance lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their own cookies on your computer.
Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.
• Evolution Finance uses web beacons to access Evolution Finance cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with Evolution Finance products and services.
EDITING YOUR INFORMATION

==========
This includes your marketing preferences.

==========
• We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the services of Evolution Finance that are considered part of your Evolution Finance account without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them, including such items as service announcements, administrative messages, and the Evolution Finance Newsletter.

• When you use Evolution Finance services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
==========
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.
In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
==========
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
Evolution Finance takes your security very seriously, and we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data, both during transmission and once we receive it.
In particular, we:
• We limit access to personal information about you to employees, contractors, and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
• We regularly back up the information we collect online to protect against loss.
• We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.
Some of the safeguards that we use include: SSL encryption, firewalls and password protections.
However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile device or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
