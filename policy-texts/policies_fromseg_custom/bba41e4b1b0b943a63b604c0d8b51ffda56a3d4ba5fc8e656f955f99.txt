This Privacy Statement presents MediaMath’s privacy policy, including privacy practices for data use and collection by our platform and on  the www.mediamath.com website.
MediaMath is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of internet users.
==========
Accordingly, we adhere to applicable industry guidelines, and will continue to review and improve our privacy policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of consumer information.
MediaMath complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
MediaMath has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

==========
MediaMath's technology complies with the rules of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project, as outlined by the World Wide Web Consortium.
P3P provides a simple, automated way for users to gain more control over the use of their personal information.
MediaMath is an active member of the industry associations that govern the use and policies around online consumer privacy including the IAB, IAB UK, the Digital Advertising Alliance  (‘DAA’) in the US, EU and Canada and the Network Advertising Initiative  (‘NAI’) (www.networkadvertising.org).
MediaMath complies with the aforementioned Self-Regulatory Principles and we believe that these Principles help protect and ensure individual consumer privacy.
==========
MediaMath uses a DAA-Approved platform to comply with the  ‘Enhanced Notice’ standard as dictated by the cross-industry Self-Regulation Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
As part of this service, advertisements served by MediaMath’s platform are sometimes delivered with icons that serve as a signal to consumers that behavioral data has been used.
Through the icon, consumers can learn how their information is being used and by what companies, and access tools to control the collection and use of their information.

MediaMath Data Collection On Behalf of Our Clients
In the course of delivering an ad to you, MediaMath does not collect personally identifiable information about you.
Personally identifiable information includes data such as your name, address, phone number, social security number, or email address.
MediaMath does collect non-personally identifiable information about you, for the use of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of MediaMath’s advertisers.
This non-personally identifiable information includes data like:



Domain Type
.

com, .
net, .
edu, etc.
==========
Standard Data
Common information found in every communication sent over the internet.
Using this information, MediaMath can infer information such as: browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); internet service provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon).
Clickstream Data
MediaMath can infer how you use our clients’ sites and pages on the Internet.
MediaMath may use this non-personally identifiable data to create data segments, and these data segments are generally based upon the websites that you visit.
MediaMath also receives information from 3rd party data providers who collect and make available information such as behavioral, contextual, and demographic data, for our clients to use in targeting ads through our platform.
==========
For example, our clients may use health-related segments such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications.
(Click here for a complete list of Health-related segments provided by 3rd party data providers, that may be used in MediaMath’s platform.)
MediaMath does not collect data or create data segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we don’t use any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes).
At MediaMath, we think it’s important to provide transparency to help you have a better idea of which segments might be collected by us, so you can make informed decisions.
==========
About Cookies
Like most digital marketing platforms, MediaMath uses "cookies" to enhance users’ experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads and for ad delivery and reporting.
MediaMath cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.
What are cookies and how do they enhance your Web experience?
A MediaMath cookie is a unique number that is assigned to your browser the first time MediaMath serves your browser an ad or identifies your browser on a client’s website.
This number is stored in a file on your computer and helps us deliver relevant ads to you.
==========
For instance, cookies help MediaMath ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same advertisement.
Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness of an advertisement.
This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to your needs and deliver to you ads for the types products in which you might be interested.
Although MediaMath believes that cookies help enhance your experience on the web by delivering more relevant messages to you, MediaMath does not need cookies to deliver ads to you.
If you decline a MediaMath cookie, you will still be able to view ads; however, you may see the same ad repeatedly or be delivered ads that have no relevance to you.
==========
Data Retention - How long is data stored?
MediaMath sets our cookies to expire after three years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.
MediaMath retains the web log data for ninety (90) days and aggregations and reports for up to three years.
==========
Information Pertaining to Children
MediaMath’s products and services are designed for those 13 years of age and older.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
If the company is made aware that it has received personally identifiable information from someone under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.
