GOV.UK (or www.gov.uk) is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS), part of the Cabinet Office.
Cabinet Office is the data controller for pages starting with www.gov.uk.
Where these pages link out to services provided by other departments, agencies and local authorities (like www.access.tax.service.gov.uk or www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk), their own privacy policies will apply.
These are managed separately by each service provider.
A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed.
For more information, read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register.
