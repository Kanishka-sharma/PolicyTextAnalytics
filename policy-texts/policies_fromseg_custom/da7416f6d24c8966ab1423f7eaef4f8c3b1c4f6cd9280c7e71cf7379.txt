“Tags and Pixels” are blocks of code that we and our customers may use to track your navigation of websites or apps using our technology, and your browsing behaviour.
We use pixels to synchronize information that we have collected with information independently collected by our suppliers, clients, and other third parties that are interested in providing you with ads.
==========
“Cookies” are data files that often include a unique identifier, and are placed on a visitor’s device or computer.
We use cookies on our customers’ websites in order to operate our technology and collect User Information.
For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies,  visit https://www.allaboutcookies.org.
Using “cookies” we also enable third-party vendors, including Google to serve ads based on someone’s browsing history.
==========
“SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” are blocks of code similar to tags and pixels that are embedded into an app that allow us to track certain information relating to your use of apps using our technology.
We also use standard device identifiers, for example the “IDFA” advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices, to track your use of mobile apps.
Additionally, we use other technologies, including locally stored objects, to collect User Information in order to assist with the delivery of ads and to provide reporting to our customers.
What categories of data we do NOT collect

Data that might be regarded as sensitive under Article 9 GDPR, that is information concerning your race, sexual orientation, political affiliation or religious beliefs, among others.
Data that might be used for the purpose of online behavioural advertising, that is data concerning your Internet navigation over time, and that might be used in order to infer your personal interests.
==========
What do we use this data for
https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work
(1)  Buying advertising slots and managing campaigns.
By using device identifiers and contextual data such as geolocation, visited website, and date and hour of visit, we can deliver advertisement specifically to your phone.
Managing advertising campaigns also means that we use your data for ancillary activities, such as enabling standard advertising controls, and to protect and investigated fraudulent or illegal activity.
(2)  Monitoring campaign performance.
By using device and cookie identifiers, we can track whether users that click on or simply see the advertisement we manage actually visit the website of our clients, and whether they actually buy or subscribe to any product or service.
(3)  Retargeting and segmenting.
At the request of our clients, we might create lists of devices that we want to target in our campaigns, because they have previously carried certain activities, such as visiting our client’s website.
In doing so, we segment Internet users into different audiences that can be targeted separately.
In such operations, Smadex doesn’t act as data controller, but as data processor.
We do not carry out automated decision-making processes, as described in Article 22 GDPR.
