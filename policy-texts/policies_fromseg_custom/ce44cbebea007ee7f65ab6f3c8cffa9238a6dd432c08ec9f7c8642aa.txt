When you use our Services to make, accept, request or record payments, we collect information about when and where the transactions occur, the names of the transacting parties, a description of the transactions, the payment amounts, billing and shipping information, and the devices and payment methods used to complete the transactions.
==========
Location Information.
Through our applications, we collect information about the location of your device.
For more information and to learn how to disable collection of location information, please see “Your Choices” below.
Device Information.
We collect specific information about your device when you access our Services, including your hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifier, mobile network information, and information about the device’s interaction with our Services.

Information Collected by Cookies and Web Beacons.
We use various technologies to collect information when you use our Services, including sending cookies to your computer or mobile device and using web beacons.
Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive or in device memory when you visit a website or view a message.
Among other things, cookies support the integrity of our registration process, retain your preferences and account settings, and help evaluate and compile aggregated statistics about user activity.
==========
We also may collect information using web beacons.
Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails.
We may use web beacons to deliver cookies, track the number of visits to our website, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
For more information and to learn how to block or delete cookies used in the Services, please see “Your Choices” below.
Information We Collect from Other Sources
We also collect information about you from third parties, including third-party verification services (e.g. credit reference agencies, identity verification agencies, the electoral roll, electricity industry data and corporate verification services), credit bureaus, mailing list providers, and publicly available sources.
In some circumstances, where lawful, this information may include your government-issued identification number.
==========
By applying or signing up for a Square account, you authorize and consent to our obtaining from, and disclosing to, third parties, from time to time, any information about you in connection with the processing of any credit investigation, identity or account verification, fraud detection, or collection procedure, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law.
This includes, without limitation, the receipt and exchange of account or credit-related information with any credit reporting agency or credit bureau, where lawful, and any person or corporation with whom you have had, currently have, or may have a financial relationship, including without limitation past, present, and future places of employment and personal reporting agencies.
==========
Where we engage credit reference agencies to undertake credit checks and reporting, such agencies will place a search footprint on your electronic file and your personal details will be accessed by third parties for the specific purpose of anti-money laundering, credit assessment, identity verification, debt collection, asset reunification, tracing and fraud prevention.
Where we engage identity verification agencies, these agencies will access your personal details by using credit files to verify your name, date of birth, and address.
Such identity verification is not the same as a credit check.
A footprint will be left on your credit file that a search was carried out by the agency for identity verification purposes, which you can see if you check your credit file, but this record will not show up in a credit search and will not affect your ability to obtain credit.
The verification agency may also separately retain a record of its search and may share the fact of that past search with other companies that use its services.
This search record will show that an unnamed payment processor (or similar industry term) had requested an identity check.
We may also carry out a Full Electoral Roll search.
==========
Third-Party Advertising and Analytics
We may allow third-party service providers to deliver content and advertisements in connection with our Services and to provide anonymous site metrics and other analytics services.
These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information, such as your IP address, identifiers associated with your device, other applications on your device, the browsers you use to access our Services, webpages viewed, time spent on webpages, links clicked, and conversion information (e.g., transactions entered into).
This information may be used by Square and third-party service providers on behalf of Square to analyse and track usage of our Services, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests, and better understand how you use our Services.
The third-party service providers that we engage are bound by confidentiality obligations and other restrictions with respect to their use and collection of your information.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third-party cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies, which are covered by such third parties’ privacy policies.
For more information, we encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about their privacy practices.

First Data processes your information solely for the purpose of facilitating payments which use our Services, including to internally monitor, evaluate and improve any aspect of the First Data services, to fulfill any reporting or compliance obligation to the extent required by applicable law or the card scheme rules and to internally measure trends.
First Data may, in accordance with the provision of the First Data services, disclose your information to third parties and regulatory bodies, including First Data’s affiliated companies and applicable card schemes (e.g., Visa and MasterCard).
