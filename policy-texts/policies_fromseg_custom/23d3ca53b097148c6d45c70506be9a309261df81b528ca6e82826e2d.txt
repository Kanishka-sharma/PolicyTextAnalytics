These reports do not contain individual listener data.
Your stations are always available to the public; however, if you make your profile private, your profile will not be linked to your station list.

Other websites or applications that you have registered to use, or that people you know have registered to use, when we allow those websites or applications to interact through the Service to provide personalized services to you.
In some cases, those websites or applications may automatically provide us with information about you to facilitate personalization unless you use the controls available on those websites or applications to opt-out of such sharing.
Pandora® is not responsible for, and will assume no liability, if a business partner or other entity collects, uses or shares any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.

Automatic Data Collection
Copyright Tracking: Pandora® incorporates software that is designed to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to and to ensure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties.
This software identifies and counts the songs you have accessed.
Service partners: When you access the Service through a service partner, we may add select aspects of your registration information (such as your email address), so that we can identify which of our service partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on to the Service.
Information about your computer or device: We may also collect information about the computer, mobile or other devices you use to access and listen to the Service.
For example, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
If you access the Service from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device.
==========
Tracking technology: We use what are commonly called "cookies," a small data string our server writes to your hard drive, and other tracking technology (such as Flash Persistent Storage) to help us manage and track your interaction with Pandora Services.
These technologies collect non-personally identifiable information to improve Pandora Services, including to keep count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, save your password and login information, and / or display advertising or content based on your interests.
We may also capture other data such as search criteria and results, date, time, connection speed and IP addresses.
==========
Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Service may also use cookies, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices.
Advertisers, and the third-party advertising companies with whom we or our advertisers partner to deliver ads to you, may place or recognize a unique cookie or similar technology on your browser in order to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Service.
