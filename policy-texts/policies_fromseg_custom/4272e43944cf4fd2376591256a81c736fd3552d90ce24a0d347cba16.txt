Our Privacy Policy
Updated September 2004

	This privacy policy explains how Kmart.com collects, uses, and discloses the information of users of the Kmart.com Website (the "Kmart.com Website," or "our Website") and the Kmart.com ISP Services ("the ISP Services"), which are administered by our partners and contractors.
("ISP Service Partners").
==========
Important terms

	When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms "personally identifiable information" and "aggregate information."
"Personally identifiable information" is any information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate you as an individual.
Common examples are your name and email address.
"Aggregate information" lumps your behavior or characteristics together with those of a group.
==========
For instance, we may let advertisers know that 50% of our users are over 35 without disclosing the personal information of any one individual.
Collecting your information

	Information is collected through the Kmart.com Website and ISP Services.
Please note that we correlate and supplement this data with both aggregate and personally identifiable information gathered by other companies.
For example, Kmart collects personally identifiable information and information relating to customer purchases in its retail stores, and then shares this information with us.
Important: Children under the age of 18 should use our Website under the supervision of their parents or guardians.
Information collected through our Website

	When you register for the Kmart.com Website we collect personally identifiable information, including (but not limited to) your name, physical address, email address, phone numbers, and billing information.
==========
All of this information is mandatory; without it we will not register you.
We also collect personally identifiable information through purchase forms, surveys, sweepstakes entries, emails we receive from you, and your other interactions with our Website.
When you use our Website we may collect a variety of technical data, which we store in both aggregate and, if you are registered with Kmart.com, personally identifiable forms.
This data includes (but is not limited to) your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain, and Web browser information.
==========
We may track the page you visited before coming to the Kmart.com Website, and the page you link to when you leave the Kmart.com Website, which of our pages you access, and how long you spend on each page.
The Kmart.com Website uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information stored on your computer.
Cookies let our Website recognize previous visitors to our web page, record a visitor's progress from page to page, and recall certain information a visitor entered previously.
==========
For instance, a cookie may store your password, or note that you're interested in electronics.
You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the Kmart.com website may not operate properly.
We may also use tracking images and applets to collect the same information.
==========
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.
These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.
Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.
==========

We allow third parties to collect aggregate and other anonymous information about our visitors through the Kmart.com Website.
Should we enter into agreements that allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about our visitors, we will inform visitors of these activities at the location of the collection.
==========
Finally, note that our Website contains links to other sites on the Internet.
Please remember that when you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Website and entering another.
Again, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites, and encourage you to read their privacy statements (which may differ from ours).
