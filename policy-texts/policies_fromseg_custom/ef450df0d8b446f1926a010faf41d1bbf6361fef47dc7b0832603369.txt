        and SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy shall otherwise govern.

Delete your form data.
You can delete your form data (including parts of forms, entire

Cancel your Wufoo account.
You can cancel your Wufoo account at any time through your

Any cancellation of your Wufoo account will result in the deletion of your account
            and all form data stored in it.
This data cannot be recovered once your account is cancelled.
Please be
            aware that SurveyMonkey may for a time retain residual information in our backup and/or archival copies of

Security, cookies and other important information

Security.
Each Form Creator is assigned a unique username and password which is required to
            access their Wufoo account.
It is each Form Creator’s responsibility to protect the security of his or her
            login information.
Regardless of the security protections and precautions we undertake, there is always a
            risk that your personal data may be viewed and used by unauthorized third parties as a result of collecting
            and transmitting your data over the internet.
==========
Cookies.

Changes to this privacy statement.
This privacy statement may be changed in the same manner
            as changes that are made to SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy.
Online tracking.
We currently do not process or comply with any web browser's "do not
            track" signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual
            users who visit the Wufoo website or use the Wufoo services.
==========
PRIVACY FOR FORM RESPONDENTS
1.
What information does SurveyMonkey collect?
Responses to forms.
We collect and store the responses that you submit to forms.
==========
Form
            Creators are responsible for this data and manage it.
A form may ask you to provide personal information or
            data.
If you have any questions about a form you are completing, please contact the Form Creator who created
            the form directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that form.
The creator of the form
            is usually the same person that invited you to complete the form and sometimes they have their own privacy
            policy.
SurveyMonkey is not liable for any actions or inactions a Form Creator takes with respect to any
            data or information that they may collect from a Form Respondent.
2.
==========
How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?
We disclose the information we collect in accordance with SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy for
        survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and
        form data in the context of Wufoo).
3.
==========
With whom do we share or disclose your information?
We disclose the information we collect in accordance with SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy for
        survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and
        form data in the context of Wufoo).
4.
==========
What are your rights to your information?
Contact the relevant Form Creator to access your responses.
Because we collect form
            responses on behalf of Form Creators, you will need to contact the Form Creator if you have any questions
            about the form, or if you want to access, update, or delete anything in your responses.
We provide Form
            Creators with tools to maintain the responses they collect through their forms.
SurveyMonkey cannot provide
            you with this access since form responses are the Form Creator’s private information.
