These Terms of Service form a legally binding contract between you and us.

ACCOUNT AND NON-ACCOUNT USERS
You do not need to create a PlayStation®Network ("PSN") account with us in order to view the Sites.
However, if you already have a PSN account or if you create one, you will have access to more of the features on our Sites, as well as access to the PSN online community – which allows you to play games online and buy content and services, like new levels for your favorite games, movies, television shows or original programs.
If you do not already have a PSN account, you can create one here: http://www.us.playstation.com/psn/signup/.
Note that if you do choose to create a PSN account, you will need to agree to a separate Terms of Service and User Agreement ("ToSUA") and Privacy Policy that govern PSN.
When you login to your PSN account while on one of our Sites, the PSN ToSUA and Privacy Policy also apply to your activities on that Site to the extent they do not conflict with these Terms of Service.
Except for any internet fees that you are responsible for, creating a PSN account is free, so we encourage you to do so.

OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT ON SITES 
Everything on or used in connection with our Sites, including text, images, graphics, logos, audio and video content and software (collectively, “Content”) – with the exception of User Generated Content as defined below – is owned by us or our affiliates, subsidiaries, licensors or suppliers.
You may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works or in any way exploit any of the Content (including Content that the Sites enable you to download or save) without our express permission.
Here’s what permission we do give you to use the Content.
First, we give you permission to use the Content to surf and view our Sites, which means displaying or loading the Content on your computer in connection with typical web browsing activity.
Second, we give you permission to use the Content for your personal, non-commercial uses.
This means, however, that you do not have our permission to distribute the Content, to publicly display the content, charge any fee for it, use the Content to create your own website, construct a database with the Content or replicate our Sites or any parts of it elsewhere.
(We intend these only as examples and are not an exhaustive list of things you can’t do with our Content).
Regardless of the permissions we give you to use the Content, we remain the sole owner of all the Content, and you do not acquire any ownership rights in the Content by assembling, creating files, downloading or saving any of it.
If we have included an author attribution, a trademark or copyright notice or other legal notices on the Content, you should not remove or alter any of these.

USER GENERATED CONTENT 
Some of the Sites have tools that allow you to communicate with other users and to create, post, upload, share and distribute various forms of content for and in connection with the Sites, including pictures, photographs, videos and other information or materials (collectively, “User Generated Content”).
Keep in mind that User Generated Content does not include your blog and message board postings.
If you post your insights, ideas, opinions and comments on our blog site or message boards, you cannot prevent SCEA or other members of the community from using them, and you give your consent to SCEA and anyone else to use your posts in any manner.
A. YOUR USE OF USER GENERATED CONTENT

YOUR COPYRIGHTED WORK
Just  as Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. (“SCEA”) requires users of our  Sites to respect our copyrights and those of our affiliates, licensors and  business partners, we respect the copyrights of others.
To that end, we have  adopted this Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act (“Copyright Act”) (17 U.S.C. 512 et seq.).
Once  SCEA’s representative who has been designated to receive notification of  claimed copyright infringement (“Designated Agent”) – whose name and contact  information is noted below – receives proper notice of the alleged  infringement, or if SCEA otherwise comes to believe in good faith that any specific  content, including user generated content, on the Sites contain material that  infringes copyright (“Disputed Content”), SCEA may (1) promptly remove or block  access to the Disputed Content or (2) deny access to the Sites to users that  repeatedly violate copyright or other intellectual property rights.
SCEA will  take reasonable steps to notify a user who has uploaded Disputed Content if  that Disputed Content is subsequently removed or disabled.
Procedure  for Reporting Copyright Infringement:
If  you believe in good faith that your copyrighted work has been reproduced on the  Site without authorization in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,  you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may notify our Designated  Agent:
Riley Russell
      Legal & Business Affairs Department
      Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.

      By email: infringement@playstation.sony.com
Pursuant  to federal law, your notice must include the following information: 
 1.
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the  owner of the copyright that you alleged is being infringed;
 2.
Identification  of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed, or, if multiple  copyrighted works on the Site are included in a single notification, a  representative list of all those works on the Site;

4.
Your  contact information, including address, telephone number, and, if available,  email address;


5.
A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which SCEA is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.
A  statement made under penalty of perjury that the information in the  notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the  owner of an exclusive right under the Copyright Act that is allegedly  infringed.
Supplying  a Counter-Notice Regarding Alleged Copyright Infringement
If  you are the provider of the Disputed Content and believe a copyright  infringement notice has been wrongly submitted against you as a result of  mistake or a misidentification of the claimed copyrighted material, you may  send a counter-notification to our Designated Agent (whose address is included  in Paragraph 1 above).
The counter notification must provide the following  information:
1.
==========
Physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;
2.
Identification of the Disputed Content that has been removed or to which access has been  disabled, and the location where the Disputed Content appeared before it was  removed or access to it was disabled;
3.
A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the Disputed  Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification;
4.
Your name,  address, telephone number and, if available, email address; and
5.
A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States  District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or  if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial  district in which SCEA is located, and that you will accept service of  process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such  person.
==========
If  our Designated Agent receives a counter-notice from you, SCEA will send a copy  of it to the original complaining party informing that person or entity that  SCEA may replace the removed Disputed Content or cease disabling access to it.
Please note that when we forward the counter-notice, it includes your personal  information.
By submitting a counter-notice, you consent to having your  information revealed in this way.
We will not forward the counter-notice to any  party other than the complaining party.
Unless  the Designated Agent receives notice from the original complaining party that  the original complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to  restrain the user who posted the Disputed Content from engaging in infringing  activity relating to the Disputed Content on the Site, SCEA will replace or  restore access to the Disputed Content on the Site or permit the user to  re-post the Disputed Content.
