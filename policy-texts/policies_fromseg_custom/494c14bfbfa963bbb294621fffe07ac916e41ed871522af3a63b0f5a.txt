THE EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)
a. ScaleMonk as a Data Controller and a Data Processor
“Personal Data” is a term used in the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for example, names, addresses, cookie IDs, mobile ad IDs, precise location data and biometric data.
European data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”).
==========
We sometimes act as a data controller and sometimes (such as when we are handling our clients’ information) as a data processor.
This section only applies when we process your Personal Data as a data controller; when we act as a data processor, it is our client (the data controller) to whom you would need to address any questions or seek enforcement of your data subject rights (such as access to or deletion of your Personal Data).
b. Legal Basis for Processing
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, which consists of the European Union, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and processing your Personal Data will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in which we collect and process it.
==========
Our legal basis for processing your Personal Data for the purposes described in Sections 2a and 2d will typically rely on:
• Your consent.
In some cases, we rely on your consent in order to process your Personal Data.
For example, we rely on your consent when we store and gain access to information stored on your device.
For this “cookie consent” (which applies to both cookies and mobile ad IDs), we rely on mobile application developers and contractually require them to only transmit legally obtained information.
We do so to fulfill our obligations under the ePrivacy Directive.
We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, such as when we process data that you voluntarily provide through our Website and offline, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and its withdrawal.
==========
• Legitimate interests.
In some cases, we collect Personal Data from you where the processing is in our (or a third party’s, such as our clients’) legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, such as your right to opt-out.
If we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), these interests will typically be to operate the Platform (such as to detect fraud or to ensure that bugs are detected and fixed).
==========
• Legal obligations.
Some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
==========
c. International Transfer of Data
As ScaleMonk works with global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally collected.
For example, we may transfer your data to third parties that we work with who may be located outside of the European Economic Area.
When we transfer Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area, we take steps to make sure that safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data, including, when required by European data protection law, entering into European Standard Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements.
Please contact us at the contact information below for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to protect your Personal Data and privacy rights in these circumstances.
d. Your Rights as a Data Subject
As a resident of the European Economic Area, you have certain rights with respect to Personal Data that we hold about you as a data controller.
You may contact us at privacy@scalemonk.com in order to exercise the following rights:
• The right to ask us to provide you with copies of the Personal Data that we hold about you.
==========
When we receive your request, we will provide you with step-by-step instructions to follow.
• The right to ask us to update or correct any out-of-date or incorrect Personal Data that we hold about you.
• The right to withdraw your consent for processing Personal Data on which we rely on consent to process.
Once we receive your request, we will cease processing your Personal Data within 30 days or less.
You may also withdraw your consent by using the device-based opt-out described in Section 5 above.
• The right to manually request that we delete your Personal Data, subject to our instructions to confirm your identity.
==========
You may also make this request by opting out through device settings as described above.
Upon receiving this opt-out signal, your Personal Data will be deleted within 30 days if you have an Android device, or if you have an iOS device, we will permanently render the Personal Data disconnected from your device.
==========
• In addition, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
However, we hope that you will first consult with us so that we may work with you to resolve any complaint or concern you may have.
