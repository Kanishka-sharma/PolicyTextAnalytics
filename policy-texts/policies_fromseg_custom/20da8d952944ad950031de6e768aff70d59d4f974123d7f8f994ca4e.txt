YOUR RIGHTS
This section 9 applies only to individuals in the European Union and other countries which grant the rights described here.
These rights will apply only in certain circumstances.
9.1.
==========
Requesting a copy of your information
To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.
You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy.
9.2.
==========
Right to rectification of personal data
If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it.
You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete.
9.3.
==========
Right to restrict processing of personal data
You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:

You claim that the personal data is not accurate.
The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.
We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.
You have exercised your right to object to the processing.
==========
The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing

9.4.
Right to request deletion of personal data ("right to be forgotten")

    You may request the erasure of your personal information in certain circumstances.
For example, you may
    request erasure if:

The personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.
You have withdrawn your consent and we have no other legal basis for processing the personal information.
You have exercised your right to object to processing the personal information, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing it.
Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims.
If you exercise your right to erasure, this will potentially remove records which we hold for your benefit, such as your SkyMiles account information (including miles that may be in your SkyMiles account) and your presence on a marketing suppression list.
9.5.
==========
Right to object to processing of personal data
You have a right, at any stage, to object to our using your personal information to send you marketing information.
You also have the right to object to our using your personal information where our reason is based on our legitimate interests.
We will have to stop processing until we can establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or that we need to continue using it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
9.6.
==========
Right to data portability
This right applies where:

Our reason for using your personal information is either that you have given consent or that the processing is necessary for us to perform a contract with you; and


We process the personal information by automated means.
This is a right to receive all the personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this to another controller directly, where this is technically feasible.
9.7.
Complaints to regulator
You have a right to complain to a supervisory authority (i.e., a regulator which oversees data protection law compliance), in particular, in the European Union country where you live or work or where you consider we have infringed on your privacy rights.
9.8.

Exercising these rights
We may charge you a small administration fee to respond to your request as allowed by applicable law.
In general, we do not charge any fee where the right is based on European Union law.
(We can charge an administrative fee for extra copies of your information and in certain exceptional circumstances.)
Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we will provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.
==========
This time may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example, where requests are complex or numerous.
Where we do not carry out your request, we will tell you without delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request, and we will explain our reasons for not taking the action requested.

PROMOTIONAL PARTNERS
We want to give you more opportunities to earn miles in the Delta SkyMiles Program.

DATA TRANSFERS
Delta is based in Atlanta, Georgia, USA and we may transfer personal information in compliance with applicable law to the US and other jurisdictions where Delta provides services.
For EU Residents: Some of the countries where Delta provides services may not have the equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your location.
==========
If we need to transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will take steps to make sure your personal data is protected and safeguarded once it leaves the EEA.
In particular, we require third parties to whom we transfer your data to agree to abide by the Model Clauses approved by the European Commission and permitted under Article 46 of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").
==========
If you would like to obtain the details of such safeguards, you can request them from the Data Protection Officer at Privacy@delta.com.
In some limited circumstances, we may also transfer your information outside the EEA if the GDPR (under Article 49) allows this.
This includes where it is necessary for the performance of a contract between us and you and where the transfer is necessary in connection with legal proceedings.
