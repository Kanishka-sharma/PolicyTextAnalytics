Friends Reunited Privacy Policy 
« Back


 At FriendsReunited, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our Members' personal information.
This is a legal document that sets out how FriendsReunited handles data which identifies you.
You should read it in conjunction with the FriendsReunited Terms and Conditions, of which this Privacy Policy forms part.
1.
==========
Emails from Friends Reunited.
You are probably most interested in how we will use your email address to communicate with you, so here's our email promise, in plain English: 
Service Emails.
The team at Friends Reunited hate spam and will never ever send you unsolicited emails.
But there are some emails that we will need to send you to provide you with a good Friends Reunited service.
==========
These include notifications that you have a message from an old friend, reminders about your membership expiring and guides on how to use the site.
A full list of the types of emails you will receive to help you use the service most effectively (which we call Service Emails) are shown below: 

Validation email – the email we use to verify your email address when you first register 
Welcome emails - emails which explain how to use the site when you first join
Payment receipt – this is sent if you upgrade to Full Membership 
Renewal notices – these remind you to renew your Full Membership 
Automatic Full Membership renewal alerts – if you have selected automatic renewal of your Full Membership, we will alert before this happens 
Key service messages – if we need to notify you about changes to the service 
New message notification and reminders – when you receive messages from old friends 
Notes/profile and photo approval notification 
Service suspension notices – if you break the house rules 

As well as these Service Emails, you will also receive New People Alerts and (if you have opted to receive them) our occasional newsletters.
These emails genuinely help you make the most of the website and let you know when there's new fun and interesting stuff to do.
==========
Here's a bit more about them… 
New People Alerts.
We automatically send you our New People Alerts.
==========
They are an essential part of the Friends Reunited service because they tell you when people you may know have joined the site or have added more information.
The good thing about this email is it lets you know when you should pop back to the site.
Without it you would never know there was new stuff to read.
If at anytime you decide you don't want to receive the New People Alert, all you need to do is uncheck the “New People Alert” box in your email preferences.
You'll find this in the “My details/profile” page which can be accessed from the a link on the left hand side of the website once you're logged in.
Instructions on this can be found at the bottom of every New People Alert.
==========
Newsletters.
When registering, you are given the option to receive our occasional newsletter.
==========
We use this to notify you about new features on the site, ask your opinion, and tell you about services you might not be using yet.
We only send a newsletter when there is something worthwhile to tell you about, so your inbox will never be overflowing with guff from us.
==========
Generally you'll get a newsletter about once every six weeks.
If you decide you no longer want to receive these newsletters – or if you aren't currently receiving it and want to – all you need to do is change your email preferences.
You'll find this in the “My details/profile” area once you're logged in.

==========
The information we gather and track.
Information gathered on registration.
When you register for the FriendsReunited Service, you provide your name (including a previous name, where relevant), one or more category listings on the Friends Reunited Service (school, workplace, street etc) your email address, and some optional notes about yourself ("Registration Information").
==========
They are available to you, and capable of being changed, through the “My details/profile” page.
Cookies.
We use small files known as "cookies" to enhance Members' experience of the FriendsReunited Service as follows: 

To hold Members' login information, so that your category listings are displayed when you visit the FriendsReunited Service.
This option can be turned off by switching the "Remember Your Password" option to "No" in “My details/profile” 
To facilitate optimal use of the FriendsReunited Service by Members, by means of a temporary "session" cookie.
These cookies disappear when the Member's browser session ends, or if the Member clicks the "logoff" text, which appears on the FriendsReunited Service.
==========
In addition we use Neilsen Netratings , an independent measurement and research company.
They use cookies and code on the site to gather non-personal data regarding the number and frequency of visitors to our site.
Both the cookies and the embedded code provide  general site and not personal statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths taken by visitors through the site and other general information.
==========
Friends Reunited uses this type of information to help it improve the services to its members.

Sharing and use of information 
•  The over-riding principles we apply are these: 
• i. We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation - thus, you can rest assured that we will not sell the lists of our Members' email addresses to a third party; and 
• ii.
t he only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy.
==========
•  Registration Information.
Once a Member selects a school or other category listing (workplace, street etc), , the Registration Information held for that Member, except for the email address, will be available to, and searchable by, users of the Friends Reunited Service.
•  Emailing through the FriendsReunited Service.
We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the FriendsReunited Service.
The only legitimate way of making contact with a friend found on the FriendsReunited Service is for a Full Member to enter a message that we will send on the Member's behalf.
We will notify the addressee Member, using the email address he/she has provided to us, that FriendsReunited is holding an email for him/her, and the Member can collect the email when logged in to the FriendsReunited Service.
Members may check and (if required) change the email address we hold for them at any time through “My details/profile”.
Members' personal notes must not include their email address.
Sent and received email may appear in a Member's Inbox on the FriendsReunited Service for an indefinite period - we do not delete it after any specific period.
However, this does not mean that we will retain your email forever; there may come a time when we will need to delete some or all of it, for technical or other reasons.
In this event, we will endeavour to give you advance warning that we are going to do so.
==========
•  Advertising.
The FriendsReunited Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses.
We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymised demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately.
==========
•  Credit Card information.
There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we use Worldpay plc and Datacash as our payment providers.
Both operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments.
They encrypt Members' credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly.
This means that Members' full credit card details are never revealed to us.
Worldpay plc and Datacash may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties.
•  Companies in the Friends Reunited group.
We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group, but only for the purposes described in this policy.
==========
•  Changes in Friends Reunited's business.
If all of the assets which Friends Reunited uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party so that the acquirer can continue to provide the Friends Reunited Service.
•  Place of processing.
The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom .

==========
Security 
We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally.
However, it remains each Member's responsibility: 

to protect against unauthorised access to Your Details; 
to ensure no-one else uses the FriendsReunited Service on that Member's machine while it is "logged on" to the FriendsReunited Service; 
to log off or exit from the FriendsReunited Service when not using it; and 
to keep his/her password secret.
