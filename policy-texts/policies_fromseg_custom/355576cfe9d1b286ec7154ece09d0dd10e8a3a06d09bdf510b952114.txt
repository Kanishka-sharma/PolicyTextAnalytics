Security
All personal and credit card information is encoded using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology before being sent over the Internet.
To protect your data further, your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a database that is away from our Web site database, so it isn't connected to the Internet.
Credit card transactions are issued a digital certificate, ensuring that your data can only be read by our transaction system as long as your browser shows its secure mode symbol (such as a key or closed lock).
To make the most of the security on our site, we recommend using either Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft® Internet Explorer™ version 4.0 or higher, both of which enable SSL.
We also recommend setting your browser's preferences to accept cookies and enable JavaScript™.

Some of our pages are specially designed for children.
We do not send unsolicited direct email to users who have indicated on registering of those pages that they are under 13.
Children under 13 should ask a parent, guardian or teacher for permission before sending us information online.
