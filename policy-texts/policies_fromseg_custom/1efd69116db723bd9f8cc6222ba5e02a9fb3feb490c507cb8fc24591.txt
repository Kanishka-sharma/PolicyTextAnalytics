COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY
BJ’s knows that you care about how your information is used and shared.
We respect your right to privacy.
==========
Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us.
We want to make sure that you understand the type of information we collect about you, how it is used and the safeguards that we have in place in order to protect it.
This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
The type of information that we collect and retain depends upon your interaction with BJ’s and BJ’s Sites.
Here is a short overview of the various types of interactions.
==========
Information You Give Us.
We collect the personally identifiable information (such as your name, Membership Number, address, email address, telephone number, driver’s license number, and, if you pay by credit card, your account information) that you provide us with when you:
Purchase, upgrade, downgrade or renew your BJ’s Membership.
Register, make a purchase, indicate your marketing preferences or process a rebate on or through BJ’s Sites.
Participate in surveys or contests (information we collect may include demographic information, such as age, gender and number of household members).
==========
Communicate with us for any reason, such as replying to inquiries by mail or through BJ’s Sites, by telephone, through BJ’s Member Care, or in person at one of our Clubs.
You may choose not to provide certain information; however, you might then be unable to take advantage of many of the opportunities offered by BJ’s, including the online features offered on BJ’s Sites.
Automatic Information.
When you interact with BJ’s, we may maintain a record of the following types of information:
Your purchases from BJ’s Sites and Clubs.
Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other technical information such as a referring web site, if any, and the path you take through BJ’s Sites when you visit BJ’s online.
The IP address or technical information collected by BJ’s Sites is not linked by us to personally identifiable information, except in cases where BJ’s must provide IP addresses to certain credit card processors in connection with the processing of your credit card transaction.
==========
You may want to contact your credit card provider with any questions regarding the transactional information they require.
Information from Third Parties.
BJ’s may receive personally identifiable information from third parties such as the following:
Updated delivery and address information from our shippers, or other third parties, such as Service Providers and Product Suppliers who furnish various fulfillment and consulting services.
Information from our Specialty Business Partners, the third parties that offer products and co-branded services to our Members, including but not limited to, optical products and travel services.
These Specialty Business Partners will have received your information in connection with transactions that you conducted with them or because you have provided it to them in connection with your purchase of their products or use of their services.
These Specialty Business Partners have established their own respective policies and practices regarding the collection and use of personal information gathered from you.
You should therefore refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and choices you have with respect thereto (see “Specialty Business Partners” under ONLINE SPECIFICS below).
Information from our Service Providers who perform functions on our behalf (see DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
below for examples of BJ’s Service Providers).
Information from our Product Suppliers with whom we participate in joint promotional activities.
Demographic information (such as age, gender and number of household members), purchase preference information and mailing lists from our Product Suppliers and other third parties.
==========
DO WE USE TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT INFORMATION?
We collect information through technology to make our sites more useful to you and for various purposes related to our business.
For instance, when you come to our sites, we collect your IP address.
==========
An IP address is associated with the access point through which you enter the Internet, and is typically controlled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your company.
Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.
We may use IP addresses to collect information regarding how frequently our guests visit various parts of our sites, and we may combine IP addresses with personally identifiable information.
Our Web sites collect information through a variety of technical methods, including cookies and Web beacons.
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site.
Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites.
Cookies, web beacons and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.
If you do not want us to store this information, or if you are using a public computer, the “Help” portion of the toolbar (on most browsers) will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
==========
Some of our Specialty Business Partners may also use cookies on their respective sites (for example, BJ’s Travel®).
However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies.
Therefore, please read the privacy policies of all other sites linked to this web site.
We may use the information collected through these technical methods for many purposes, including delivering content, tracking and enhancing our visitors’ experience on our Web sites.
For example, when you return to our Web sites after logging in, cookies provide information so that we will remember who you are.
We also may use technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites, or other activity on our sites.
==========
These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.
HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?
The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests and transactions, to provide you with high-quality service, to tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest to you, to customize your experience on BJ’s Sites, and to understand your needs so that we may provide you with the most suitable products and services.
For example, we may use your postal address, email address and/or telephone number to help us:
Provide Member/non-member support.
Communicate Membership opportunities and renewal notices.
Advise you about BJ’s products and services, including information about manufacturers’ product recalls.
Process and fulfill your order and notify you of your order status.
Solicit your feedback about BJ’s products and services.
Provide you with promotional information that we believe adds value to your Membership, such as coupons, promotions, or information about services (“Promotional Material”).
Notify contest winners and award prizes.
==========
If you do not wish to receive Promotional Material from us, we make it easy for you to let us know.
You can contact us at any time to indicate your marketing preferences (see WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF MY INFORMATION?
below).
==========
The purchase history that we collect is generally used to assist BJ’s in selecting and offering products and services to Members which best suit their needs and to keep track of eligible purchases for BJ’s Rewards® and any other incentive programs.
The non-personally identifiable information that we automatically collect is utilized in the aggregate to help us look for trends so that we can improve the BJ’s shopping experience for you and our other Members.
Send-To-A-Friend: If Members elect to use our referral service for sending a friend information on BJ’s Sites, we may ask them for the friend’s name and email address.
Some email Promotional Material may also contain links to “Send to a Friend.”
Promotional Material may be sent by a Service Provider on behalf of BJ’s.
Any email addresses submitted to BJ’s for the purpose of forwarding Promotional Material to others will not be used for BJ’s mailing lists and will not be collected for re-distribution.
BJ’s does not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties.
Under certain circumstances and from time to time, BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with third parties as set forth below.
In such circumstances, we provide only the information necessary to perform the function or to provide the service for which it has been shared.
==========
These third parties are not permitted to use the personal information provided by us for any purposes other than those authorized by BJ’s and these third parties are required to keep the information confidential.
BJ’s may share your information with third parties such as:
Product Suppliers: BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with BJ’s Product Suppliers when participating in joint promotional activities in order to advise you of upcoming offerings and promotions, to conduct research, or to provide marketing assistance that will benefit both our Product Suppliers and BJ’s.
Service Providers: BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with trusted Service Providers who may provide operational or other support services to our Members, or who perform certain functions on our behalf.
Examples include providers who fulfill orders, process payments, process rebates, distribute emails, conduct research or provide other marketing assistance.
==========
Specialty Business Partners: BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with BJ’s Specialty Business Partners, such as BJ’s Travel®, in order that they may notify you of their offerings.
Sometimes we may send offers to selected groups of Members on behalf of our Specialty Business Partners.
To facilitate Members’ orders with Specialty Business Partners’ web sites that link to BJ’s Sites, BJ’s may “pre-populate,” or permit these sites to recognize and input certain personal Member information to avoid repeated reentry of required information associated with these orders.
If you apply for or request certain products or services directly from our Specialty Business Partners, you may receive information directly from them regarding their products or services.
Sweepstakes and Marketing Promotions: BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information when we partner with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions.
In this case, BJ’s and the partner company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers.
Additionally, such information may be shared with the partner company to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.
==========
Other Disclosures: BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information if BJ’s believes in good faith that such disclosure is: (a) authorized by law or necessary to comply with a legal process; (b) in response to legal claims; (c) to respond to Member inquiries originating with the account’s Primary Member or an officer or principal of a Business Member’s organization; (d) necessary to protect personal safety, property or other rights of BJ’s and its Members or employees; or (e) an integral part of a sale of all or part of our business.
We may share aggregated demographic information and/or customer profile data with our business partners, advertisers, and others.
This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF MY INFORMATION?
==========
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.
We give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving Promotional Material from BJ’s and from the sharing of your information with our Product Suppliers and Specialty Business Partners.
Your choice to opt out will apply only to all Memberships sharing the same Membership Number (Primary Members and Household Members share the same Membership Number).
Your choice to opt out will not apply to our “Specialty Business” Partners to the extent you provide information directly to them in connection with transactions that you conduct with them or with the purchase of their products or use of their services.
(See "Specialty Business Partners" under ONLINE SPECIFICS below.)
==========
If you do provide information directly to such third parties, you may receive communications from them irrespective of your election with BJ’s.
We are not responsible for any information that you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy and security practices and policies.
Also, your opt out choice will not apply to the sharing of information with our Service Providers when you have given your personally identifiable information to us related to your Membership, processing of orders, or other specific purposes.
