Nor do we ask you to provide any such information.
==========
We currently only use cookies to store your region/language and safe search settings.
Furthermore, when you access Duck Duck Go, your Web browser automatically sends non-personally identifiable information to us, such as your type of browser and IP address.
Our web logs collect this standard information.
While our web logs may be stored indefinitely, we recognize that IP addresses can be used, in some cases, to link searches to particular people.
As such, we will remove IP addresses from our logs within 1 year.

Finally, if you personally send a communication to us, e.g. a support email or public feedback, we may hold on to that communication so we can respond appropriately.
Information Shared
We will only share your information with others in the following circumstances.
If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we reserve the right to transfer any information we have collected.
If such an event transpires, we will, however, provide notice to you, via an update to this policy, of any information to be transferred and/or subject to a different policy.
==========
If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes, we may share your information with the appropriate legal bodies.
Similarly, we may share your information with law enforcement officers or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms of Service; respond to claims that content violates the rights of third-parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Duck Duck Go, its users or the general public.
We share information with our contractors and vendors in the normal course of doing business.
However, we require these parties to process your information in compliance with this policy.
Finally, we may also share aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of searches for a particular term.
