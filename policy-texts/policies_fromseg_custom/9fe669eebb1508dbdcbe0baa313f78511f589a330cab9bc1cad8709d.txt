privacy
  policy


  Valve respects the privacy of its online visitors and users of its products.
Valve
  recognizes the importance of protecting any information collected from users
  and has adopted this privacy policy that guides how Valve gathers, stores,
  and uses information provided from users through Valve products and online
  sites.
==========
This policy is current as of its last revision date.
However, please note
  that this policy may be amended from time to time to reflect changes and
  additions to the privacy policy.
Please check back for the most current
  version before relying on any of the provisions in this privacy policy.
==========
Collection and Use of Information
By using Valve's online sites and products, users agree that Valve
  may share with other parties aggregate information and individual information
  but not personally identifiable information gathered by Valve in the course
  of the continuing use of Valve online sites and products.
"Aggregate
  information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns,
  and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the
  identity of any particular user.
"Individual information" is
  information about a user that is presented in a form distinguishable from
  information relating to other users but not in a form that personally
  identifies any user or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any
  user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such communication.
This
  information may be used to improve Valve's products and online sites, for
  internal marketing studies, or simply to collect demographic information
  about Valve's users.
Valve may use customer contact information provided by users to send
  information about Valve, including news about product updates, contests,
  events, and other promotional materials, but only if the users agree to
  receive such communications.
Except in the cases described below, Valve will
  not share personally identifiable information with any third party unless the
  user agrees to such disclosure in advance.
"Personally identifiable
  information" consists of a user's name, email address, physical address,
  or other data about the user that enables the recipient to personally
  identify the user.
While Valve collects personally identifiable information
  on a voluntary basis, for certain products and online sites, Valve's
  collection of personally identifiable information may be a requirement for
  access to the product or site.
Personally identifiable information and
  individual information will be processed and stored by Valve in databases
  situated in the United States.
Valve may allow third parties performing
  services under contract with Valve to access stored information but such
  access shall only be to the extent necessary to provide those services.
==========
In
  those instances, the third party will be bound by the terms of this privacy
  policy.
Personally identifiable information collected from users may be done in
  conjunction with associates under agreement with Valve.
If an associate of
  Valve is collecting your personally identifiable information within one of
  our products or online sites, Valve will make users aware of this at the time
  the information is gathered.
For example, product registration data for
  Half-Life is collected by Sierra On-Line and registration data for the
  stand-alone version of Team Fortress 1.5 is collected by Won.net and shared
  with Valve.
==========
If a user does not want to provide this information, the user may
  choose to opt out of providing this information.
Additionally, if providing
  the information is a requirement of usage, the user may decline to use that
  particular service or product.
==========
When possible, Valve will make a reasonable
  effort to direct users to the privacy polices of these associates.
Valve's
  privacy policy does not extend to associates of Valve.
Furthermore, external websites and companies with links to and from Valve's
  online sites and products may collect personal information about users.
Valve's privacy policy does not extend to these external websites and
  companies.
Please refer directly to these companies and websites regarding
  their privacy policies.
Valve may release personally identifiable information to comply with court
  orders or laws that require us to disclose such information.
Children Under The Age of 13
  Valve will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any
  person age 12 and under.
Valve encourages parents to instruct their children
  to never give out personal information when online.
Parents who are concerned
  about the transfer of personal information from their children may contact us
  at privacy@valvesoftware.com to obtain a record of any information held by
  Valve and have it removed at their request.

  user's hard drive to customize a person's usage of a product or online site,
  keep records of a user's access to an online site or product, or store
  information needed by the user on a regular basis.
Use of cookies is
  typically associated with websites.

  unique authorization key or CD-Key that is either entered by the user or
  downloaded automatically during product registration.

  is used to identify a user as valid and allow access to online play of
  Valve's products.
==========
Additionally, some user configuration settings for
  multiplayer game play, including the player name input by the user, are
  uploaded to the server for online play.
The player name along with current
  game play stats is displayed to other users during multiplayer game play.
==========

  multiplayer game play is public information.
Valve does not associate this
  game play information to personally identifiable information and will not
  disclose a user's personally identifiable information to other users.
Chat Forums
  From time to time, Valve's online products may provide chat forums to users.
Any information that is disclosed in these chat forums is public information
  and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal
  information in such chat forums.

  Valve provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications
  from Valve when you are asked to provide information.

  by removing the users' information from Valve's databases.
