Claims of Copyright Infringement
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe  that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.
If you believe in good  faith that materials hosted by the iVillage Network infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send iVillage  a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following  information (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an  exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been  infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on this website are covered by a single notification, a  representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the  subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow iVillage to locate the material on  the iVillage Network; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining  party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner  complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the  information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized  to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that  a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send iVillage a  counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA;  see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to this website should be  sent to: Gillian Lusins, VP of Intellectual Property, iVillage Inc., c/o NBC Universal, Inc., 75 Ninth Avenue, 7th  Floor, New York, New York 10011, DMCANOTICE@mail.ivillage.com.
iVillage suggests that you consult your legal  advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
