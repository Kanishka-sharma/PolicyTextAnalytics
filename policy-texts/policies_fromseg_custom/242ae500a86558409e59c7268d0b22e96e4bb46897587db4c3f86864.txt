WE TAKE PRIVACY VERY SERIOUSLY
At Dstillery we take consumer privacy very seriously.
As a data science company, we are interested in patterns of web browser IDs and mobile application IDs in order to understand consumer behaviors.
The data we collect via our technology is generally considered pseudonymous in most places we operate.
HOW ADVERTISING KEEPS WHAT’S ON THE INTERNET FREE
Think about TV.
==========
These days, if you want to see the really great television series and movies uninterrupted, you have to pay for them.
What if you had to pay for all the great websites and apps?
==========
Dstillery is helping keep the Internet free by enabling marketers to target their ads to the right audience in a way that protects the identity and privacy of users.
We’ve created technology that drives the performance of online ads while knowing as little about the user as possible.
It’s privacy by design.
We don’t capture certain personally identifiable information like name, address or username, or build profiles that enable us or anyone else to ascertain who you are in order to provide our services to marketers.
We don’t know who you are.
And, to be honest, we don’t care.
==========
We analyze patterns of behavior, not people.
We assign a unique ID to each web browser.
This number represents you, but it isn’t you.
==========
We don’t know who you are or anything about you.
Based on where you go online, we try to predict what brands you’d be most interested in.
==========
The result for any given user is more relevant advertising.
And for all users a robust, free Internet!

DSTILLERY’S TECHNOLOGY PRIVACY PRACTICES
Dstillery is in compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-regulatory Code.
==========
Our technology collects non-PII (defined above) from mobile apps and websites, including this website and utilizes that information to deliver interest based advertising.
We also may allow other third-party advertisers to collect Non-PII from this website and utilize it to deliver relevant ads and for other purposes in accordance with industry standards.
You may opt-out from interest-based advertising by clicking onto the DAA opt-out mechanisms.
==========
TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
Dstillery’s technology uses “network neighbor” data to help our clients deliver relevant digital advertisements on websites and mobile apps.
“network neighbors” are generally two or more people that visit the same website pages, utilize the same wifi network or use the same mobile apps.
For example, a network neighbor might be someone whose social networking profile page you’ve visited, used the same mobile application you’ve used or someone that visits the same website that you visit.
Network neighbors are likely to share many similar interests, hobbies, and other key demographic characteristics with you, although we don’t typically know what (if any) interests or hobbies are shared by any group of network neighbors.
==========
Rather, Dstillery believes that if you’re interested in a particular product or service, your network neighbors are likely to also be interested in that product or service.
Therefore, by understanding whom your network neighbors are and what they like, the company’s proprietary technology will do a better job determining the digital ads that are likely to be of interest to you.
Dstillery’s technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit (including this website), the mobile apps that you use and the ads that you see.
We also obtain data from third-party partners, including Cuebiq.
==========
And where we can reasonably infer that a particularly computer or device belong to the same household (e.g., where multiple computers or devices use the same IP address), we may extend our advertising and targeting capabilities across multiple devices.
You may encounter our technology when: Dstillery or one of our clients purchases digital ads on a website that you visit or a mobile app that you use or when one of our clients places a web beacon on a website that you visit.
Dstillery doesn’t operate the technology in the European Union and we take steps to block any data from EU data subjects prior to ingestion into our systems.
==========
The company uses the information collected in order to help make the digital ads you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.
Please note our opt-out only applies to the browser on a particular device that has opted out and does not opt you out of being served advertising.
You will continue to receive ads, but those ads will not be targeted via our technology.
For more information about our opt-out mechanisms, including our mobile application choice mechanisms, please scroll down to the section of this Privacy Policy entitled: “Controlling The Use of Your Information”.
==========
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT VIA OUR TECHNOLOGY
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via our technology, including but not limited to browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider, IP address, and basic ad serving information such as the time and date an ad is served, the name of the mobile app or URLs from the web page visited.
This type of Non-PII is also considered personal information when collected from California consumers.
==========
We collect IP addresses and pseudonymous mobile advertising identifiers created by the mobile O/S manufacturers to help our systems recognize a computer or device over time and to help us synch data with our customers and partners.
The technologies we use to collect this data include cookies and pixel tags on our customers’ websites.
We also receive precise geolocation data on mobile devices from customers and partners such as mobile application publishers and technology companies that enable the delivery of advertising onto computers and mobile devices.
==========
We also work with identity platform partners to enable our clients to bring their online and offline data into our systems for use by our technology.
The data collected by our technology is pseudonymized prior to being used for ad targeting.
Retention of Data Collected
For information gathered via our website, we store PII such as email address or billing details so long as you continue to have a business relationship with Dstillery for record keeping purposes.
==========
You may ask us to delete that information by following the instructions below.
For information gathered via our technology, Dstillery retains some data collected via its technology in its original form for up to 30 days in order to ensure that our technology is functioning properly.
After 30 days, all original raw data is deleted; de-identified data may be stored for up to 2 years for research purposes.
==========
We also store Non-PII in cookies, which expire no later than 24 months from the last time our systems have encountered a particular computer or device.
CONTROLLING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
Opting Out from Interest Based Advertising (our “Choice Mechanism”)
Computers and Web Browsers
If you’d like to opt out from having Dstillery use your information to target advertising, please click here.
When you opt out, Dstillery will attempt to place an opt-out cookie on your computer or device.
==========
The opt-out cookie tells our technology not to use your data to target ads on websites from that computer or device.
The opt-out cookie also tells our technology that California data subjects have opted out from Dstillery’s sale of their personal information.
Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
Also, when our systems are able to detect that do not track has been set on a browser, we treat that user as having opted out from Dstillery as well.
==========
Mobile Apps
Mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) offer opt-out choice mechanisms applicable to mobile applications and these choice mechanisms may be found via your mobile device settings.
And Dstillery participates in the DAA AppChoices mobile opt-out application as part of honoring the DAA Code for the Mobile Environment.
Where our systems detect that a user of a device has opted out via their mobile operating system, our technology won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device.
Similarly, when our systems indicate that a user of a device has opted-out from Dstillery via AppChoices, our technology won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device.
==========
We also use mobile operating system opt-outs and AppChoices opt-outs as a way for California data subjects to opt-out from our sale of their personal information.
Please note that these opt-out choice mechanisms only apply to the particular device that has opted out and does not opt you out of being served advertising.
You will continue to receive ads, but those ads will not be targeted via our technology.
==========
Precise Location
If you’d like to adjust your choices regarding the use of precise location data by third parties such as Dstillery, you may do so via your device settings.
Also, most mobile applications that collect precise location information offer choice mechanisms.
A helpful description of many leading mobile platform choice mechanisms may be found here.
==========
Data Integrity, Purpose Limitation
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use as described above.
