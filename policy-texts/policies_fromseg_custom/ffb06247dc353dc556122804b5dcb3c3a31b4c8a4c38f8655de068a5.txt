PANDORA TERMS OF USE

To make it a bit easier to digest our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, we thought we'd start by highlighting in plain English some of the issues.
This summary is not a legal document.
Of course you'll want to read the complete Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but here's what we think is important:
Terms:

Thanks to the way our music licensing works, you have to live in the United States to use Pandora.
==========
You also have to be at least 13 years old.
Pandora can only be used if you are in the United States.
We expect you to keep your account password to yourself
Pandora is for personal use only, that means you can't play Pandora for the patrons in your bar, coffee shop, etc.
You can't use Pandora to steal music, and you have to listen to it through pandora.com or on a device officially supported by Pandora
Do not use Pandora if you do not agree to the Terms of Use.
Your use of Pandora means you agree to the Terms of Use.
==========
Privacy:

We'll only send you emails if you sign up.
We'll never give or sell your email address to another company.
We hate spam as much as you do.
If you come to Pandora directly from a partner site, we may share your information back with the partner that sent you to Pandora.
If that's the case, we'll tell you onscreen that we're going to do so.
Other than that one case, we won't share any information that identifies you as an individual with any other third party.
Not ever.
==========
If you decide to publicly post your personal information in our community sections, we can't be responsible for what happens to that information.
Post wisely.
We track the music played on Pandora so we can make sure artists get paid.
We must report on listening in aggregate to music rightsholders, but we never report on what you individually are listening to.
To personalize advertising we may pass along your age, gender, geographic region, or the kind of music you like to our advertising service provider so the ad server can personalize the ads for you, but we never send any information that identifies you as an individual.
Our advertising system, like just about every ad system on the web, uses cookies to keep track of the ads you've already seen and to target ads to what we hope are your interests.
==========
We take great care to ensure that any personal information you store on Pandora is secure and safeguarded at all times
