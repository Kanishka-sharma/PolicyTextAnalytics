The JAMA Network™ is a consortium of peer-reviewed print and online medical publications that includes JAMA® and 9 JAMA specialty journals.
The JAMA Network Publications are owned and published by the American Medical Association (AMA).
The web sites hosting JAMA & JAMA specialty journals have been guided by the Principles Governing AMA Publications Web Sites (Winker MA, Flanagin A, Chi-Lum B, et al.
Guidelines for medical and health information sites on the Internet: principles governing AMA Web sites.
JAMA.
==========
2000;283:1600-1606.)
These guidelines were first published March 22/29, 2000, and have evolved over time.
==========
This privacy policy was updated and posted May 14, 2012 in connection with the launch of The JAMA Network™ platform and websites, which we refer to as the “JAMA Network portal” or simply JN.
"The JAMA Network platform and websites" or “JAMA Network portal” include the various components referred to above including all journal content products, services, features, functionalities, content related sites, and other information accessible through the JAMA Network portal [whether provided by the AMA or any third party].
Related sites include JAMA on Facebook, JAMA on Twitter, Medical Meetings, The JAMA Network CME, For The Media, JAMAevidence, AMA Manual of Style, JAMA Career Center®, and Author in the Room® with IHI.
==========
E-mail addresses and other personal information.
The JAMA Network websites and JN portal are committed to preserving site visitors' privacy of personal information.
The JN portal does not collect personal information from a site visitor unless that visitor explicitly and intentionally provides it.
Collection, retention, and use of personal information about site visitors will occur if you choose to interact with the JAMA Network for example, you can choose to subscribe to JAMA and/or the nine medical JAMA specialty journals, receive e-mail notifications regarding  tables of contents, topic collections, and article alerts whether or not you are a subscriber, or learn about new offerings from the JAMA Network.
Depending on the type of product or service that you request, you may be asked to provide different personal information.
The JN portal may require your name, address, telephone number, e mail address, credit card number, Internet protocol (IP) address, and/or other identifying information.
==========
For a specific listing of the type of personal information collected, please refer to the appropriate online form.
The JAMA Network portal may use your personal information collected via the sites (in addition to the e-mail address information use outlined above) for the following purposes:


Provide access to journal content.

Notify you about new products/services, special offers, upgrades and other related information from JAMA and other Network Publications.
==========
All e-mail alerts contain an "unsubscribe" option in case you want to discontinue the alert(s) at any time.
The JAMA Network portal  also occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including, but not limited to, packaging, mailing, and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, and processing event registration.
We will provide those companies only the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
==========
The JAMA Network portal may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the AMA, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of AMA, or (c) protect the personal safety of AMA personnel or members of the public in urgent circumstances.
In addition to the uses identified above, if the site visitor is a physician or medical student and changes his or her personal information on the JAMA Network portal, that information may be incorporated into the AMA’s physician database commonly known as the Physician Masterfile.
The exception to this rule is e-mail addresses; e-mail addresses provided on the JAMA Network portal are not incorporated into the Physician Masterfile.
The AMA has licensed its Physician Masterfile to third parties for more than 50 years.
This information is licensed to database licensees under strict guidelines.

The names and addresses of physicians and medical students in the AMA Physician Masterfile are made available only for communications that are germane to the practice of medicine or of interest to physicians or medical students as consumers.
