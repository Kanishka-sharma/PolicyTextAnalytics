Services.
==========
The Service facilitates your electronic distribution of customer-created content to your lists of subscribers or contacts, each of whom must have consented previously to the receipt of such content (“Recipients”) and may also include certain on-line marketing automation services.
While Customer retains iContact to assist with the transmittal of content to its Recipients, Customer acknowledges that iContact does not actually send Customer content to Recipients on Customer’s behalf.
The Service is comprised of a web-based technology platform through which such content is delivered once Customer sends such content.
==========
Among other things, iContact provides customer support and formatting assistance for the electronic content Customer desires to distribute.
In all cases, iContact simply acts as agent for Customer with its authorization.
Customer and not iContact is responsible for the content and accuracy of all information submitted for distribution via the Service, even if such content has been reviewed, edited or written by iContact.
Customer agrees it will only use the Service for Customer’s own internal business purposes.
If Customer does not intend to use the Service for business purposes, Customer must contact us at customercare@icontact.com.
==========

During the Term (as defined below) and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in any guidelines, rules or operating policies that iContact may establish and post from time to time on icontact.com (the “Site”), including, without limitation, iContact’s anti-spam policy, privacy policy and prohibited content and commerce statement, each of which is incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the “Policies”), iContact agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with the Service.
From time to time, iContact may modify the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and/or in the Policies.
All such changes shall become effective once posted on the Site, and Customer’s use of the Service thereafter shall be subject thereto.
In the event of any conflict between any term or condition set forth in this Agreement and in a Policy, the former shall govern.
==========
Customer agrees that its purchase of the Service is neither contingent upon the delivery of any future functionality or features, nor is it dependent upon any oral or written comments made by iContact with respect to future functionality or features.
Other Services.
Professional Services.
In addition to the Service, Customer may purchase certain premium services ( “Professional Services”or sometimes referred to as iContact Premier), which Professional Services may be customized pursuant to a mutually agreed upon written statement of work provided to Customer upon the earlier of its request or its selection of desired Professional Services (each a “Statement of Work”).
The Professional Services are provided by iContact separate and distinct from the Service and are not required for Customer’s use or enjoyment of the Service.
==========
In the event of any conflict between any term or condition set forth in this Agreement and in a Statement of Work, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in such Statement of Work.
Any Statement of Work may be modified or amended only with the written consent of each of iContact and Customer.
Any Professional Services purchased by Customer shall be used by Customer within the term of the applicable Sales Order.

iContact reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to refuse to undertake any monitoring that iContact reasonably deems improper or unlawful.
(ii) Customer agrees that content provided to Customer through the use of the Monitoring Service will not be resold, republished or otherwise systematically distributed to third parties in any form, including but not limited to via an intranet, extranet or internet site.

iContact makes no representation or warranty, whether express or implied, regarding the origin, accuracy, correctness, completeness, subject matter, content, or editorial approach of any Third Party Content.
==========
(iv) Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Third Party Content monitored by iContact may be subject to copyrights owned by third parties.
iContact does not imply, represent or warrant, by virtue of supplying information incorporating Third Party Content, that iContact holds or grants any license to use any content.
Customer’s use of any content shall be at Customer’s sole risk and expense and usage may be subject to restrictions imposed by one or more third-party copyright owners, and Customer agrees that it shall comply with any such restrictions.
==========
(v) iContact does not represent or warrant that any specific sources will be monitored.
iContact reserves the right to change the sources that it monitors at any time.
==========
iContact may need administrative access to Customer’s social media platform in order to provide the Monitoring Service.
Landing Pages.
This Section 3.C sets forth the terms and conditions governing iContact’ provision and Customer’s use of iContact’s landing pages (the “Landing Pages”) and only applies if such service is listed on a Sales Order, or is part of a suite of purchased services, in either case, the Landing Pages shall be considered part of the Service.

(iii) iContact reserves the right in its reasonable discretion to immediately disable Customer’s Landing Pages if Customer’s bandwidth significantly exceeds the average bandwidth usage of other Customers.
==========
Freemium Plan.
Some of the Services are offered on a free plan (“Freemium Plan”).
In the event Customer elects to use the Freemium Plan, Customer will have cost free access to an account with a maximum of 1 user, 1 list, and 1 landing page.
==========
The account may include up to 500 contacts and 2,000 sends per month.
Further details are posted on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to use the Services and a plan comparison is available here.
==========
Freemium Plan features such as Contact Limits and Level Limits are subject to change at any time.
A Freemium Plan account will automatically terminate if no emails are sent from the account for 365 consecutive days.
Customers may upgrade to a paid account with additional features and higher Contact Limits and Level Limits at any time.
==========
Purchase.
Pricing for email distribution is based upon which platform is being used and either (i) the number of Subscribers (“Subscriber Limits”); or (ii) the number of Contacts (“Contact Limits”) that Customer chooses to purchase as indicated on the webpage through which Customer subscribes to the Service or in a negotiated sales order, as the case may be (in either case, the “Sales Order”).
Subscriber Limits are based upon the number of email addresses that are subscribed to a Customer’s particular email list in the Service.
Contact Limits are based upon the total number of email addresses associated with the Customer in the Service.
==========
The Sales Order identifies Customer’s Subscriber Limits or Contact Limits, Level Limits (as defined below), term, subscription fee, payment method and other account information.
If the Subscriber Limits or Contact Limits stored in Customer’s account exceeds the applicable level set forth in the Sales Order, Customer’s access to and use of the Service will be disabled until Customer: (i) reduces the number of Subscribers or Contacts stored in Customer’s account; or (ii) upgrades its account to at least equal the number of Subscribers or Contacts stored in its account.
==========
Customer may upgrade (but not downgrade) Customer’s Subscriber Limits or Contact Limits at any time during the term of this Agreement.
Additionally, Customer will be limited by the total number of emails per month that may be sent “Level Limits”.
The total number of emails per month that may be sent by Customer who has Subscriber Limits cannot exceed six (6) times the Subscriber Limits.
The total number of emails per month that may be sent by Customer who has Contact Limits cannot exceed ten (10) times the Contact Limits.
For example, if Customer’s Subscriber Limit is 100,000, Customer’s Level Limit is up to 600,000 emails per month.
If Customer requires a sending limit higher than its Level Limit per month, Customer should contact iContact’s sales group at sales@icontact.com or 877-820-7837.

In the event Customer fails to make timely payments when due, iContact may, at its election, discontinue, terminate or suspend the Services, without incurring any liability to Customer.
