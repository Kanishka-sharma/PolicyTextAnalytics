We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet 
business and communications.
We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure 
the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site.
To do this, we use 
Action Tags and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site.
The information we collect helps us learn things like what kinds of customers 
our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what 
kinds of offers our customers like to see.
Although our marketing company logs 
the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may 
and may not be used.
