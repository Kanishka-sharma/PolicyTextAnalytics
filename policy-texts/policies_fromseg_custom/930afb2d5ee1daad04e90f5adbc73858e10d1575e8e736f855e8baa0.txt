Comet Cursor Privacy Policy
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
It's short and you don't need to be a lawyer or a software engineer to make sense of it.
==========
If there are any technical terms that you don't understand, we encourage you to visit www.webopedia.com.
This resource will give you friendly definitions.
==========
If you have any additional questions, please email or call Adam Solomon, our Chief Privacy Officer.
His email is asolomon@cometsystems.com and his phone number is (212) 231-2000 ext.112.
==========
The Comet Cursor is a software product developed by Comet Systems, Inc., and includes website cursor viewer and desktop cursor manager functionality.
We want you to feel comfortable downloading and using our products.
==========
We understand that your trust in us depends on us respecting your privacy and being careful about safeguarding any information that you provide us.
Comet has put in place strict guidelines—detailed below—to demonstrate that we are acting in ways that we (as longtime citizens of the Internet ourselves) expect to be treated when we download software or buy products on the Internet.
Does Comet Systems use the Comet Cursor to track the websites I visit or what I do on them?
No.
If I download and install the Comet Cursor, will Comet Systems send me unsolicited commercial email ("spam")?
No.
==========
What does Comet Systems do to protect my security when I download and install the Comet Cursor?
During the download and installation of the Comet Cursor, Comet Systems uses Microsoft's high-security technology to make sure that the software you are installing has not been tampered with or modified by anyone outside of Comet Systems.
==========
The technology (called Authenticode) verifies that a given software file has not been modified from the time it was "signed" (i.e., shipped) by its publisher.
Like the seal on a bottle of Tylenol, this technology reveals if the software has been tampered with before it reaches your computer.
==========
If this tamper-test fails, the software will be rejected and prevented from running on your computer.
These protections help ensure that our software remains virus-free.
==========
Does Comet Systems collect usage statistics on the Comet Cursor, and if so, what does it do with such information?
Yes, but only anonymously.
Comet Systems collects anonymous usage statistics on the Comet Cursor.
==========
We use these statistics to improve our software products.
These statistics are limited to direct usage of the Comet Cursor only, such as how many people installed the Comet Cursor this month, or how many people saw Dilbert website cursors this month and the web address of the websites that displayed them.
Beyond these anonymous usage statistics, we never collect information on where Comet Cursor users go on the Web and what they do on the Web, or any other information that is not directly linked to usage of the Comet Cursor.
Does Comet Systems create individual user profiles with the Comet Cursor usage statistics it collects
No.
What personally identifiable information is collected about users of the Comet Cursor?
None.
==========
"Personally identifiable information" is non-anonymous information such as your name, phone number, credit card information, address or email address—anything that could identify you personally.
Users who download the Comet Cursor are not asked for personally identifiable information to use it.
Will I get email from other companies because I purchased the Comet Cursor?
No.
==========
Users who download the Comet Cursor will never receive any email from Comet Systems or any other companies as a result of trying or using the Comet Cursor—note that you are never asked to provide an email address in those situations.
Does the Comet Cursor include unique serial numbers?
==========
Yes, an ANONYMOUS download number.
Remember, we don't collect personally identifiable information, so we don't know who you are.
We use this anonymous download number to count how many people have downloaded the Comet Cursor.
Has Comet Systems linked the Comet Cursor download number, license keys, or any other unique product serial numbers with personally identifiable information?
No.
==========
Since Comet does not collect any personally identifiable information, we cannot create linkages between personally identifiable information and Comet Cursor unique serial numbers.
What can I do to remove the Comet Cursor from my computer?
The Comet Cursor is straightforward to remove using the standard Windows method for uninstalling programs.

We encourage you to periodically check back here (there are links to this privacy policy from the Comet Cursor and from the www.cometcursor.com website).
==========
If we ever make changes to our privacy policy, we will post them here seven days before they go into effect.
