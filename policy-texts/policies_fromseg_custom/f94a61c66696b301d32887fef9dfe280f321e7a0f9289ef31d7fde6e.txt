Organization: Internet Archive
The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.
At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.
==========
View the web archive through the Wayback Machine.
Content crawled via the Wayback Machine Live Proxy mostly by the Save Page Now feature on web.archive.org.
==========
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project.
The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process.
The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

LAST UPDATED: July 21, 2020
This Notice updates and supersedes previous versions.
We may change this Notice at any time, effective when we make the updated Notice available via the Sites (as defined below).
==========
Our Sites use Cookies and Similar Technologies (as defined below) for various purposes, including to ensure that we give our visitors the best possible experience by providing you with personalized content, remembering your marketing preferences, and helping you to obtain the right information on our Sites.
You can find out more about Cookies and Similar Technologies, how we use them as well as your rights to control our use of them below.
You can manage your preferences in relation to Cookies and Similar Technologies used on our Sites by using the Manage Cookie Settings tool.
What are Cookies?
==========
Cookies are small files—usually consisting of letters and numbers—placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device, when you use that device to visit a web site.
Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their web sites operate, work more efficiently, and provide analytic information.
Cookies may be placed on your device by Intel as the Site owner.
These are called “first party” Cookies.
Some Cookies may be placed on your device by a party other than Intel.
These are called “third party” Cookies.
For example, a vendor may place a third party Cookie to enable online chat services.
Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies
This Notice describes how Intel, our vendors, and other third parties on our behalf use Cookies and Similar Technologies (such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage) ("Cookies") in connection with communications sent by Intel or on our behalf and the websites (including mobile websites and apps) owned and controlled by Intel (the “Sites”).
The Intel Privacy Notice will apply in addition to this Notice where we collect and use personal information through the Cookies.
Listed below are the different categories of Cookies that Intel and vendors on our behalf may use on our Sites.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These technologies are necessary for the Intel experience to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
==========
The technology is usually only set in response to actions made by the device owner which amount to a request for services, such as setting privacy preferences, logging in, filling in forms, maintaining secure login areas, maintaining state across pages (remembering items in a shopping basket), and server load balancing.
The device owner can set their preference to block or alert Intel about these technologies, but some parts of the Intel experience will not work.
These technologies do not store any personally identifiable information.
==========
Analytics Cookies.
These technologies allow Intel to count device visits and traffic sources, so Intel can measure and improve the performance of our experiences.
The technology helps Intel to know which experiences are the most and least popular and see how device owners interact with the experience.
==========
All information these technologies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
If the device owner does not allow these technologies, then Intel will not know when the device owner visited or how the device owner interacted with our experiences.
==========
Functional Cookies.
These technologies enable the Intel experience to provide enhanced functionality and personalization.
The technology may be set by Intel or by third-party providers whose services Intel have added to our experiences.
If the device owner does not allow these technologies, then some or all of these services may not function properly for the device owner.
Ad Targeting Cookies.
==========
These technologies may be set through our Intel experience or by our advertising partners.
The technology may be used to build a profile of the device owner’s interests and show the device owner relevant advertisements on other experiences.
The technology does not store directly personal information on the device, but the technology is based on uniquely identifying the device.
If the device owner does not allow these technologies, then the device owner will experience less targeted advertising.
==========
How Long do Cookies Stay on My Device?
Some Cookies operate from the time you visit a Site until the end of that particular browsing session.
These "session" Cookies expire and are automatically deleted when you close your Internet browser.
==========
Some Cookies stay on your device between browsing sessions—these "persistent" Cookies do not expire when you close your browser.
The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie.
==========
How does Intel Provide Online and Mobile Advertising?
We and our vendors, and our other third parties, engage in interest-based advertising to deliver advertisements and personalized content that we and other advertisers believe will be of interest to you.
Third party vendors will be responsible for their own use of personal information collected through the Cookies.
Advertisements may be delivered to you based on your online or mobile behavior (on Intel Sites and non-Intel sites), your search activity, your responses to one of our advertisements or communications, the pages you visit, your general geographic location, or other information.
These ads may appear on our Sites or on third party websites.
==========
The vendors with whom we work to help us conduct interest-based advertising may be members of self-regulatory associations such as the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).
For Sites directed at persons located in the European Union, we may work with vendors who are members of the European Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA).
You may also see advertisements for third parties on Intel Sites or other websites or properties, based on your visits to, and activities on, Intel Sites and other sites.

What about Similar Tracking Technologies?
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
==========
Intel may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or opened a communication that we have sent them.
This enables us to assess the effectiveness of communications.
==========
In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
Our Sites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects) to remember settings, preferences, to provide special content, such as video and animation playback and for other Site operations.
If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.
You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.
==========
How does Intel respond to a Do Not Track signal?
There is currently no industry agreed upon response to a Do Not Track signal.
At this time, Intel services and Sites do not function differently based on a user’s Do Not Track signal.
For more information on Do Not Track, see All About Do Not Track.
==========
