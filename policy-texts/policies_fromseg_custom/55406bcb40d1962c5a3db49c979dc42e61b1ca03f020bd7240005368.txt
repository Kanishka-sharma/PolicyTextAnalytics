To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by fax, regular mail, or email only.
We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice.
A DMCA notice must:
1.
Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, "My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located].")
;

==========
Identify the Content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work.
