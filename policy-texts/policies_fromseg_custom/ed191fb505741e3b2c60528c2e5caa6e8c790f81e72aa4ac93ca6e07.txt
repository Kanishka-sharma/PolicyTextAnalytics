The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our members and activists.
EFF has established this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through this website and how it is used.
In this policy, "EFF" refers to EFF staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, and consultants, all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep information they receive as part of their assistance to EFF confidential.
EFF does not sell or rent donor information under any circumstances, and we do not share information without prior consent except as compelled by law.
