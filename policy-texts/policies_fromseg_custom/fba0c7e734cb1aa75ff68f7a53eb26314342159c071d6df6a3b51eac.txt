      How do we use uploaded images?
Your images are secure and will be treated confidentially.
We transfer them SSL/TLS-encrypted and use them only to remove the background and then offer you the result for download.
We do not share them with third parties, do not publish them and do nothing else with them.
==========
At the latest about one hour after the upload we delete both the uploaded image and the result image.
Apart from that, we keep usage statistics (without images) and if you contact us e.g. by email, we also receive personal data from you, which we use to reply to you.
If we have a customer/supplier relationship, we also use your data for bookkeeping and similar purposes.
If you want to know more, you will find the long version below.
