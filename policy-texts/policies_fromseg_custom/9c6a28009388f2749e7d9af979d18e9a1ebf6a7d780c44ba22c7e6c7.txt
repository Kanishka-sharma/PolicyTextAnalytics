USER PROVIDED CONTENT
Portions of the Service and Content on the Websites are submitted by you and other users ("User Provided
                Content"), to which you may contribute appropriate material.
For User Provided Content, we are merely
                hosting and providing access, and we cannot accept any liability whatsoever with regard to such material
                (including with respect to its accuracy).

                other rights of other people or organizations.
By submitting material to the Websites, you represent
                that you have the right to do so, and that you have obtained any third party consents where required
                (e.g., under data protection or intellectual property laws), and, subject to these Terms and
                restrictions on data processing in our Privacy Statement, as amended from time to time, you grant Find A

We cannot commit to prior review or monitoring of User Provided Content, but we may apply, at our
                discretion, automated filtering tools (for example, to suppress and omit from display information
                submitted to the user-submitted family tree elements of the Website which appears in our best judgment,
                using algorithms, to pertain to a living person).
We also reserve the right to act expeditiously to
                remove or disable access to any User Provided Content that comes to our attention, including information
                which we believe, in our sole discretion, is illegal, obscene, indecent, pornographic, illegal or

MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS, THE WEBSITES AND THE SERVICE
Find A Grave may modify these Terms (including any of the terms incorporated by reference herein), the

                Internet economy, applicable laws and industry practices, or other reasons.
Changes will be posted on
                the Websites or you may be notified, at our discretion, by email, postal mail or otherwise.
With respect
                to any changes to the Terms that involve material adverse changes, such as deteriorated entitlements or
                higher costs for paid for services, we will offer you an opportunity to opt out of such changes for the
                remainder of the period that your payment related to (with the effect that we continue to apply the
                previous version of the Terms or allow users who are opting out to terminate early subject to a
                pro-rated refund of prepaid fees), if and as required by law.
If you do not accept these Terms or do not
                wish to be bound by changes following posted notices you should discontinue using the Service and the

MISCELLANEOUS
These Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Service or the Websites
                (including contract, tort, statutory and other claims) shall, to the extent permitted by the applicable
                law, be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Utah, without regard to its
                principles on conflicts of laws, and the federal law of the United States of America.
Your mandatory,
                statutory consumer rights, including your court jurisdiction, shall be unaffected.
In the event that any term of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these
                Terms shall remain valid and enforceable.
We can replace ay term which is not valid and enforceable with
                a term of similar meaning which is valid and enforceable.
Any failure by us to enforce any term of these Terms shall not affect our right to require such
                performance at any subsequent time, nor shall the waiver by us of any breach by you of any provisions of
                these Terms be taken to be a waiver of the provision or provisions itself.
In as far as permissible under applicable law, you agree to indemnify us against all liabilities, claims
                and expenses that may arise from any breach of these Terms by you or otherwise as a result of your use
                of the Websites.
