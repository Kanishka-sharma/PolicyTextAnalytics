The benefits of data sharing
Why do you need my data anyway?
Data sharing not only provides a range of benefits to job seekers and employers, it also enables us to improve our services to you.
Data sharing means more employers, more job listings and more job seekers
Data sharing between the affiliated sites allows job seekers to access a broader database of job listings and employers.
It also helps employers access more job seekers.
For example, one site may be able to recommend jobs or employers on another affiliated site.
It can also help applications, resumes or job listings work across the affiliated sites.
==========
The sites can also share employer data, such as account information and behavioral information, to provide a better experience to those employers.
Data sharing improves our services to you
Data sharing allows our sites to provide personalized and improved content, performance, features and services.
For example, our sites may use and share your previous search or browsing history (e.g. the jobs you click on) and your resume or profile information to determine relevant search results and job alerts.
