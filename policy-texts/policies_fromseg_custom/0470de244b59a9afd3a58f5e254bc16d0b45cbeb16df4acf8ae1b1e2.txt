DigiCert Privacy Policy

Introduction
DigiCert, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers and website visitors.
As a result, DigiCert has developed this privacy policy to inform its website visitors and customers about DigiCert’s practices regarding data collection and use.
Non-Personal Information
DigiCert, like most website operators, uses cookies and web beacons to automatically gather, analyze, and store non-personal information about website visitors.
Non-personal information may include the visitor’s IP address, browser type, ISP, referring page, operating system, date/time, and clickstream data.
DigiCert uses third-party software to assist in collecting and analyzing this information.
This information is used to improve DigiCert’s service and enhance the experience of DigiCert’s website visitors.
Automatically collected non-personal information is not linked to personally identifiable information.
==========
Personal Information
In order to provide quality communication, DigiCert collects the name and email address of website visitors who submit sales or technical support questions.
DigiCert also collects and stores personal information about its customers in order to provide requested products and services.
This information is voluntarily submitted by the customer or is obtained from third party databases.
Regardless of the source, DigiCert protects personal information as confidential information except where the information is embedded in an issued digital certificate.
This information is necessary for the digital certificate’s operation and is considered public information.
==========
DigiCert’s certificate profiles, available through DigiCert’s online repository at http://www.digicert.com/ssl-cps-repository.htm, list the information embedded in each certificate type.
Updating Personal Information
Generally, a customer can review and update personal information through its DigiCert account interface by clicking edit under the Account Profile tab.
Alternatively, customers may  make request changes to personal information by sending an email to admin@digicert.com or by mailing DigiCert at the address listed in this policy.
Emailed and mailed requests are subject to DigiCert’s satisfaction about the authenticity of the request.
==========
Personal information embedded in a digital certificate cannot be directly edited.
Customers wishing to update personal information in a digital certificate must submit a change request through the customer account.
DigiCert may require that the updated information be verified for accuracy prior to accepting the change request.
In addition, even if information is updated in DigiCert’s databases, the information will generally not be updated in the issued digital certificate.
If information embedded in a digital certificate needs updating, DigiCert may require revocation of the digital certificate.
==========
Use of Information
Products and Services
DigiCert may use personal information to provide the products and services requested by the customer, including using the information to validate the customer or to contact the customer in order to discuss support, renewal, and the purchase of products and services.
DigiCert may allow its business partners to assist in providing requested products and services.
All DigiCert business partners are required to keep personal information confidential and are only allowed to use the information to the extent necessary to provide the requested products and services.
Live Chat Sales/Support
DigiCert utilizes a live chat tool for assisting our customers with sales questions and technical support needs; in addition to the customer's name and email address (for purposes of communication), this tool collects information in accordance with "Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites" above.
Emails
DigiCert may send out promotional emails (such as a newsletter) to individuals who provide personal information and do not opted-out of DigiCert’s mailing list.
These emails may include beacons that communicate information about the email back to DigiCert.
This communication allows DigiCert to gauge the effectiveness of its advertising and marketing campaigns.
Subscribers may opt-out of receiving promotional communication from DigiCert by following the instructions provided in each promotional email or by emailing privacy@digicert.com.
DigiCert also sends out advisory emails.
Advisory emails are related to the primary purpose for which the information was collected and are used to respond to inquiries, provide support and validation services, provide upgrade information and security updates, and inform the customer about ordered products and services.
==========
Because advisory emails contain essential information related to the use and security of DigiCert’s products and services, customers may not unsubscribe from advisory emails.
DigiCert may use third parties, with which it has a confidentiality agreement, to send promotional or advisory emails.
However, DigiCert restricts its partners from sending spam associated with DigiCert’s site, brand, or products.
If you receive an unsolicited email related to DigiCert’s products and services, please forward the entire message and headers to legal@digicert.com.
==========
Third Parties
DigiCert never sells personal information to third parties.
DigiCert may provide personal information to third parties (such as web host provider or affiliated party) if the information owner consents to the distribution.
DigiCert uses a third party to process credit card payments and may provide credit card numbers and identifying financial data directly to the third party credit card processor.
These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
DigiCert does not permanently store any provided credit card information.
DigiCert also uses a third party to provide its chat-based support.
==========
The support software allows users to input information, including an email address, to request support and clarify their problem.
The software provider does not share inputted information with anyone other than DigiCert.
DigiCert may disclose information when required by law or when disclosure is necessary to protect DigiCert’s rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
Security
The security of personal information is of the utmost importance to DigiCert.
DigiCert only transmits personal information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
==========

DigiCert follows generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information during transmission and storage.
Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
==========
While DigiCert strives to use commercially acceptable standards to protect personal information, DigiCert cannot guarantee absolute security.
Safe Harbor
