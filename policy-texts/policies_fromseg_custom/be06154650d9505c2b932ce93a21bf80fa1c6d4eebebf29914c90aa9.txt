Children Privacy Rules

            Our website is not intended for persons under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children under the age of 16.
If you have reason to believe that a person under the age of 16 has provided personal data to us, please contact us at privacy@sketchfab.com, and we will make every effort to answer your queries or to delete that information from our databases.
Digital Will

            Under the French Digital Republic bill, you have the right to make arrangements for the storage and communication of your personal data after your death.
To exercise this right, you can send us your instructions at privacy@sketchfab.com.
==========
Recipients of Your Personal Data

            We may share your information with the other members within Sketchfab but only for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.
We may disclose your personal data:
        


                to business partners, suppliers, and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you, for example for hosting and operating the Services or providing support and maintenance services for the Services;
            

                to analytics and search engine providers and other selected third parties that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our website;
            

                to our regulators, law enforcement, or fraud prevention agencies, as well as our advisors (including legal advisors and auditors), courts, and any other authorized bodies, for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity or other regulatory or legal matters;
            

                in the event of a merger, acquisition, or other similar event, to a prospective buyer or otherwise of our business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to such prospective buyer or otherwise of such business or assets;
            

                if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Sketchfab, our customers, or others.
This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; and
            

                to legal advisors and otherwise in connection with legal proceedings in order to enforce or apply our rights under any contract;
            


            We do not share your information with third parties for their marketing purposes, unless we obtain your consent.
==========
Where We Store Your Personal Data
Transfers inside of the European Economic Area

            All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers, within the European Economic Area ("EEA").
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website and apps, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
==========
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website.
Any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access, including keeping security patches up to date wherever possible, and by constantly investigating new ways to keep data secure.
==========
Transfers outside of the European Economic Area

            The data that we collect from you will be transferred to our US entity in order to be processed by our Marketing, our Community, and our Operations teams.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
==========
In particular, we comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.
On 16 July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the Privacy Shield Framework while confirming the validity of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors outside the EU/EEA ("SCCs").
Pending the outcome of the U.S. Government and the European Commission negotiations on an enhanced EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework to comply with the July 16, 2020 judgment of the CJEU, Sketchfab no longer relies on the EU–US Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data of its EU customers to the US, but instead uses SCCs to ensure that the transfer is based on a valid method.
However, we maintain our adherence to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability.
Sketchfab remains subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
==========
In the context of an onward transfer, Sketchfab has responsibility for the processing of personal data we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
Sketchfab shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if this agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the alleged damage.
In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles in each of the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
==========
Please note that, for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, we may also transfer your personal data to our service providers based outside of the European Union in countries other than the USA which are not considered as providing an adequate level of protection by the EU Commission (see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en for further detail).
We guarantee that we will take all necessary measures to secure these data transfers in accordance with the GDPR through the use of SCCs.
A copy of the European Commission approved model SCCs is available here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=en



Exercising Your Rights in Relation to Your Personal Data

            Before processing your personal data and, at the latest, at the time of collection of your personal data, we inform you of the purpose of the processing of your personal data, the recipients of this data, the retention period applied to your personal data, as well as your rights in this context.
==========
Under French law n°78-17 dated 6 January 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties as amended and, after 25 May 2018, under the GDPR, you have the right to access, to rectify, to restrict and, where applicable, to delete your personal data.
You also hold the right to data portability.
==========
You have the right to request access to your Personal Data

                    You have the right to request confirmation that your Personal Data is being processed, access to your Personal Data (through us providing a copy) and other information about how we process your Personal Data.
You have the right to ask us to rectify your Personal Data

                    You have the right to request that we rectify your Personal Data if it is not accurate or not complete.
You have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Data

                    You have the right to ask us to erase or delete your Personal Data where there is no reason for us to continue to process your Personal Data.
This right would apply if we no longer need to use your Personal Data to provide the Service to you, where you withdraw your consent for us to process special categories of your Personal Data, or where you object to the way we process your Personal Data (see the section "You have the right to object..." within this table below).
You have the right to ask us to restrict or block the processing of your Personal Data

                    You have the right to ask us to restrict or block the processing of your Personal Data that we hold about you.
This right applies where you believe the Personal Data is not accurate, you would rather we block the processing of your Personal Data rather than erase your Personal Data, and where we don't need to use your Personal Data for the purpose we collected it for but you may require it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have the right to port your Personal Data

                    You have the right to obtain and reuse your Personal Data from us to reuse (in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable format) for your own purposes across different services.
This allows you to move Personal Data easily to another organization, or to request us to do this for you.
You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data

                    You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data on the basis of our legitimate business interests, unless we are able to demonstrate that, on balance, our legitimate interests override your rights or we need to continue processing your Personal Data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
However, you also have the absolute right to object to our processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
==========
You have the right not to be subject to automated decisions

                    You have the right to object to any automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision has a legal or significant impact on you.
You have the right to withdraw your consent

                    You have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Data.
==========
You can exercise these rights, with a proof of your identity, by simple written request sent by email to privacy@sketchfab.com.
We will respond to any request received from you within one month from the date of the request.
If your request is not sufficiently precise or does not include all elements enabling us to answer your request, Sketchfab may ask you to provide additional elements.
==========
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection national.
In France, this is the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL): https://www.cnil.fr/.
==========
California Privacy Rights

            Pursuant to California’s Shine the Light statute (Cal.
Civ.
Code Sec.
==========
1798.83), you can control if we share personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.
To opt-out of us sharing personal information with third parties for such purposes, email us at privacy@sketchfab.com or write to us in the “Contacting Sketchfab” section of this Privacy Policy and include “Marketing Opt-Out” in your request.
==========
In addition, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California residents may have certain other rights concerning their personal information.
This section describes (i) the categories of personal information collected and disclosed by Sketchfab, subject to CCPA, (ii) your privacy rights under CCPA, and (iii) how to exercise those rights.
==========
When we use the term “personal information” in this section, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
Personal Information We Collect.
During the past twelve (12) months, we and our service providers have collected the categories of personal information set forth below.
==========
We may disclose each of these categories of personal information to our service providers for our business purposes (to enable the service providers to provide their services) and as otherwise described in the “Recipients of Your Personal Data” section above.
We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use personal information collected for additional purposes without providing you notice.
==========
Identifiers (for example, name, postal address, date of birth, email address, IP address, and online identifiers);
Categories of personal information as defined by Cal.
Civ.
Code § 1798.80 (for example, name, telephone number, passport number, driver’s license number, and account numbers);
Protected classifications under California or federal law (for example, age, citizenship status, national origin or ancestry);
Commercial information (for example, transaction history);
Internet or other electronic network activity information, including information on your usage of the Services;
Geolocation data;
Sensory data (for example, audio from call recordings);
Professional or employment related information; and
Inferences drawn from any information identified above to create a profile.
==========
In the last 12 months, we do not have knowledge that we sold any personal information of California consumers, nor actual knowledge that we sold the personal information of California consumers under the age of 16 years old.
The CCPA defines “sale” as:  selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information to another business or third party for monetary or valuable consideration.
If we do sell your personal information, we will notify you, and if you submit to us a verifiable consumer request we will disclose to you a list containing the categories of personal information that we sold in accordance with the CCPA’s requirements.
Your Privacy Rights.
In accordance with the CCPA, California residents may exercise, under certain conditions, the following privacy rights with respect to their personal information.
Please note: you will not be discriminated against in any way if you exercise the rights listed below, which means we will not deny goods or services to you, provide different prices or rates for goods or services to you, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services to you.
