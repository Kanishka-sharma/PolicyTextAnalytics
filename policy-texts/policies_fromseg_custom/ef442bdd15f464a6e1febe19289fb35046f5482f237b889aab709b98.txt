MediaMath Data Collection on Behalf of Our Clients
In the course of delivering an ad to you, MediaMath does not collect personally identifiable information about you.
==========
In other words, we do not collect information, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address.
However, MediaMath does collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for instance), and whether you responded to the ad delivered.
The non-personally identifiable information that we collect is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of MediaMath's advertisers.
This non-personally identifiable information includes:


Domain Type
com, .
==========
net, .
edu, etc.
Standard Data
Common information found in every communication sent over the Internet.
Using this information, MediaMath can infer information such as: browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); Internet service provider (e.g., MindSpring or AOL).
Clickstream Data
MediaMath can infer how you use out client sites and pages on the Internet.
In addition to the data above, MediaMath may receive non-personally identifiable data, such as behavioral, contextual or demographics, through partnerships with online and offline 3rd party data providers.
About Cookies
Like most Internet sites, MediaMath uses "cookies" to enhance user's experience on the Web.
MediaMath cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.
What are cookies and how do they enhance your Web experience?
A MediaMath cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the first time MediaMath serves you an ad or identifies you on a client’s website.
==========
This number is stored in a file on your computer and helps us deliver the optimal ad to you.
For instance, cookies help MediaMath ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same advertisement.
Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness of an advertisement.
This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to your needs.
In other words, cookies help us deliver to you the types of ads in which you are more interested.
Although MediaMath believes that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web by delivering more relevant messages to you, MediaMath does not need cookies to deliver ads to you.
If you decline a MediaMath cookie, you will still be able to view ads; however, you may see the same ad repeatedly or be delivered ads that have no relevance to you.
==========
How long is data stored?
MediaMath sets our cookies to expire after five years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.
MediaMath retains the web log data for ninety days and aggregations and reports for up to three years.
==========
