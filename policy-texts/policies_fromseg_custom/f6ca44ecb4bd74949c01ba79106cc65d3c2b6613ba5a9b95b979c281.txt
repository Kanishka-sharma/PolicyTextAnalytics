We collect anonymous and pseudonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs.
For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address (pseudonymous), the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.
In order to enable features such as Ecosia's tree counter, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience.
You can block or delete cookies and still be able to use Ecosia, although if you do, you may lose your tree count as well as resetting any manual language or location settings.

Use of the Data
We only use your personal information to provide you with or improve Ecosia services, or to communicate with you about our services or the Website.
We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.

In order to help us provide, maintain and improve the Ecosia Website and its services, we provide anonymous or pseudonymous information to third-party services.
For example, search queries traveling to Yahoo! contain web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp in each request, which subjects this information to the terms and conditions of Yahoo!.
Examples of other third party services we use are:
Google Analytics: anonymous (network domains, browser, operating system, region, demographics, language settings, page views, time/date); pseudonymous (IP address)
CrazyEgg: anonymous (navigation around web pages, clicked links)
Mixpanel: anonymous (installs, updates, clicked links, browser, operating system, region, demographics, referring URL, custom events)
Flurry: anonymous (installs, session length, frequency of use, impressions, clicked links, crashes, custom events)
We also use social buttons provided by services like Twitter and Facebook.
