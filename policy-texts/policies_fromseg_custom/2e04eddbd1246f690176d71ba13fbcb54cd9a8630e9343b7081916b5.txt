Effective date: June 7, 2018
Welcome to About.me.
Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”).
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at [email protected].
==========
These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and About.me, Inc. (“About.me,” “we” and “us”).
You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services.
Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.
==========
These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy.
Will these Terms ever change?
We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.
We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the About.me website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
==========
If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.
If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
==========
What about my privacy?
About.me takes the privacy of its users very seriously.
For the current About.me Privacy Policy, please click here.
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.
==========
You must be at least 16 years old to use the services.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 16; if you are a child under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.
If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [email protected].
==========
What are the basics of using About.me?
About.me enables users to create a personal website (the “Website”) to provide information about who you are and what you do and to centralize your online presence.
Certain Services we provide also enable you to engage with the end users of your Website (your “End Users”), such as booking appointments, sending messages, or capturing leads.
When you sign up for an account, you must provide your email address and select a password and user name (“About.me User ID”).
==========
You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself.
You may not select as your About.me User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person.
You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.
You represent and warrant that you are an individual who is at least 16 years old.
==========
You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.
If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services.
We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.
==========
You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password.
You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.
Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:
You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:
Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including About.me); Violates any law or regulation, including any applicable export control laws;
Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable; Jeopardizes the security of your About.me account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);
Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user; Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;
Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);
“Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);
Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;
Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.
A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.
What are my rights in About.me?
==========
The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws.
You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including About.me’s) rights.
You understand that About.me owns the Services.
You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.
The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!
==========
Do I have to grant any licenses to About.me or to other users?
Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.”
Any User Submissions that you post to your Website will be publicly accessible.
In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them, you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.
Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.
==========
For all User Submissions, you hereby grant About.me a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below.
This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
If you store a User Submission in your own personal About.me account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant About.me the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.
If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services (a “Public User Submission”), then you grant About.me the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission publicly accessible to all visitors to your Website and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with About.me’s business, provided that About.me will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services.
Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
If you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Service (“Feedback”), then you grant us a nonexclusive license to use, commercialize, exercise, and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.
==========
You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your About.me account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from About.me’s records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.
Finally, you understand and agree that About.me, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.
==========
What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?
You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like About.me, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright.
We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here.

Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?
==========
Your Website and your End Users are your responsibility.
About.me has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for your Website or any interaction with your End Users.
==========
You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to your Website and your End Users.
If you collect or process any personal information of your End Users or if you send marketing or other electronic communications to any End Users you must comply with all applicable data protection, security and privacy laws and regulations (including, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation).
If applicable law requires, you must provide and make available to your End Users on Website a legally compliant privacy policy.
==========
Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.
We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.
==========
We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.
You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.
==========
You will keep all your registration information accurate and current.
You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.
The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by About.me.
When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that About.me is not responsible for such risks.
==========
We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.
About.me has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services.
In addition, About.me will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service.
By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.
Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.
You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.
==========
You agree that About.me shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.
If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that About.me is under no obligation to become involved.
In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release About.me, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.
If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”
==========
What if I sell products or services or collect money through my Website?
You are solely responsible for all of all ecommerce activities you conduct through your Website, including your products and services, all applicable taxes and fees, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and compliance with any applicable laws.
==========
We are not involved in your relationships or transactions with any End User, customer or potential customer.
You are responsible for resolving all support questions, comments, and complaints, including refunds, chargebacks, or pricing questions.
You should provide contact information so that customers may contact you with questions or complaints.
You are responsible for providing all products and services sold to your customers, and for fulfilling all promises, representations, or warranties you make to them in connection with a sale.
==========
We may enable you to collect payment from your End Users via third party ecommerce payment processors through an integration with your Website.
Payments from your End Users to you via such integration will be processed in accordance with the applicable payment processors’ terms and policies.
==========
Your End Users will submit their payment information directly to such payment processors.
We don’t collect or store your End Users’ payment information.
==========
Will About.me ever change the Services?
We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.
We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.
We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical.
Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
Does About.me cost anything?
==========
Though many of our Services are currently free, we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future.
You shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the About.me website in connection with such Services selected by you.
About.me reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the website.
Your use of the Services following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.
==========
Premium Services.
If you choose to sign up for our premium services (the “Premium Services”), you will be charged an annual or monthly subscription fee, depending on the type of subscription you select.
The subscription fee for the Premium Services (“Subscription Fee”) will be charged to you in advance as further described below.
You may request a refund within three (3) days after we charge your Subscription Fee (including any renewal fees).
Otherwise, Subscription Fees are non-refundable.
Auto-Renewal for Premium Services.
Your enrollment in the Premium Services will be automatically renewed and your Payment Method (defined below) will be charged every twelve (12) months if you choose to pay annually, or every one (1) month if you choose to pay monthly.
If you wish to cancel auto-renewal of the Premium Services for the following year, you must cancel your plan in your Billing pane.
You are eligible for a refund if you request one from About.me within three (3) days of your receipt of the auto-renewal charge.
==========
About.me may change the Subscription Fee upon notice to you, but such change will only take effect once your then-current Premium Services term has ended.
If you do not wish to pay the new Subscription Fee, your only remedy shall be to cancel your enrollment in the Premium Services for the following year or month (depending on your type of subscription), prior to the expiration of your then-current Premium Services term.
You may cancel your Premium Services subscription at any time, but again, refunds will only be granted if the user meets criteria outlined above.
==========
Billing.
We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Premium Services.
The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms.
We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor.
By choosing to use Premium Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Premium Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (for example, a credit or debit card you provide) (your “Payment Method”).
==========
You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.
We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
Payment Method.
==========
The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.
If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.
==========
Reaffirmation of Authorization.
Your non-termination or continued use of a Premium Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Premium Service.
We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.
This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.
Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Premium Service (or as your payment terms may be amended thereafter).
==========
Current Information Required.
You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account.
You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our Payment Processor if your Payment Method is cancelled (e.g. for loss or theft) of if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your username or password.
Changes to such information can be made in your account settings.
If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of Premium Services under your billing account unless you have terminated your Premium Services as set forth above.
==========
What if I want to stop using About.me?
You’re free to do that at any time, by deleting your account from your account settings pane or contacting us; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.
==========
About.me is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.
About.me has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.
We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of About.me.
If you have deleted your account by mistake, you can create another one at any time by visiting our homepage.
Or, you can contact us at [email protected] – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.
==========
Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.
By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.
==========
What else do I need to know?
Warranty Disclaimer.
Neither About.me nor its licensors or suppliers makes any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
==========
Indemnity.
To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold About.me, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.
In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).
==========
Assignment.
You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without About.me’s prior written consent.
We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.
==========
Choice of Law; Arbitration.
These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
==========
Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in San Francisco County, California, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction.
For all purposes of these Terms, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California.
==========
Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ABOUT.ME ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
Miscellaneous.
==========
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the About.me may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.
The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
==========
You and About.me agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and About.me, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of About.me, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind About.me in any respect whatsoever.
