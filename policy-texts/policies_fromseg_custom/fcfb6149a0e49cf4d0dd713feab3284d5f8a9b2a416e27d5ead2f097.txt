Copyright Law
Under U.S. Copyright Law (www.copyright.gov/title17), the author of a creative work automatically owns the copyright in that work upon its creation.
No formal registration is required; ownership is immediate.
The author can transfer ownership of a copyright to another so the copyright owner may not be the original author of the work.
==========
Creative works include songs, stories, poems, paintings, photographs, or other works that contain a creative element.
Ownership of the copyright gives the owner exclusive rights in that work such as the right to display, reproduce, transmit, create derivative works from, publicly perform, distribute, and license the creative work.
This means that, absent permission from the creator, you may not take the creative work owned by another and exercise these rights.
Such a violation is called “infringement” of the owner’s copyright.
For example, if you legally purchase a music CD, you may not create copies of the music on that CD and distribute those copies to others over the Internet.
==========
Helping others to violate the owner’s copyright by making it easy for them to distribute such materials may also be illegal.
Actions and Penalties for Copyright Infringement
Under U.S. Copyright Law, a copyright owner who has been the victim of copyright infringement is entitled to recover actual damages and profits from the infringer or statutory damages of up to $30,000 per violation.
The copyright owner has the right to permanently enjoin the infringer from further infringing activities.
==========
Walden University, recognizing and respecting intellectual property rights, requires its employees, instructors, students, and other community members to use copyrighted materials in a lawful manner.
Walden University’s Code of Conduct, as found in the Walden University’s Student Handbook (http://catalog.waldenu.edu//content.php?navoid=32283&catoid=117), presents Walden University’s copyright policy.
Copyright infringement can result in applicants being rejected for admission and enrolled students and employees being dismissed.
==========
Additionally, Walden University maintains a vigorous program of accepting and responding to Digital Millennium Copyright ACT (DMCA) notices, which are immediately escalated to Walden University’s legal team for investigation and action.
If the materials in question are determined by the legal department to be infringing, the Information Technology department is notified and action is taken that can include either the removal of the infringing materials from Walden University’s network or the blocking of the infringer’s network access.
The infringer is notified and reminded of Walden University’s Code of Conduct.
Repeated violations can result in dismissal.
