Internal Uses
We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to determine your eligibility to receive offers for special features or products, such as the PayPal MasterCard® debit card, and 4) to improve our products and services.
At your option (as indicated in your PayPal Profile settings), we use the information you provide to access specific third party services on your behalf and perform the actions that you request us to perform, such as invoicing winning bidders on behalf of auction sellers.
We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests.

Disclosure to Other PayPal Customers
If you are a registered PayPal user, your name, e-mail address, date of sign-up, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are displayed to other PayPal customers whom you have paid or who are attempting to pay you through PayPal.
If you are a Business account holder, we will also display to other PayPal customers the Web site address (URL) and customer service contact information that you provide us.
However, your credit card number, bank account  and other financial information will NEVER be revealed to anyone whom you have paid or who has paid you through PayPal, except if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.
If you are buying goods or services and paying through PayPal, the seller of the goods or services may request that you provide a mailing address that PayPal has confirmed as matching the billing address in the credit card system.
You do not have to provide this information.
==========
If you do not provide the information, however, the seller may choose not to accept your PayPal payment and not to complete the transaction.
Beginning in spring 2001, PayPal will also disclose to other PayPal customers the number of payments you have received from Verified PayPal customers (as defined in the Terms of Use on the www.paypal.com site), or other aggregate measures that provide an indication of your reputation with other PayPal customers.
Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than PayPal Customers
PayPal will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties.
PayPal will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission (and to other PayPal customers as described above).
These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared.
We share information with companies that help us process the transactions you request and protect our customers’ transactions from fraud, such as sharing your credit card number with a service that screens for lost and stolen card numbers.
See “Information About You From Third Parties” in Section B above.
Additionally, if you go into a negative balance and owe us money, we may share information with processing companies including collection agencies.
We disclose the information we collect, as described in Section B above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements (for example, we disclose information to Providian National Bank, which is the issuer of PayPal Visa™ credit cards, so that Providian can determine customers’ eligibility for the PayPal Visa credit card, and so that PayPal and Providian can better match the products we offer to our customers’ needs).
These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified PayPal-related products or services, unless you have affirmatively agreed or given your prior permission for other uses.
==========
We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use.
Specifically, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.
==========
When a user signs up for a co-branded version of PayPal (e.g. PayPal Evite) through links on our co-branded partner's website, PayPal will share with the co-branded partner that user's name, e-mail address and physical address in order to provide enhanced integration between PayPal's services and the services of our co-branded partner.
When a user signs up for a co-branded version of PayPal through Intuit's QuickBooks software, PayPal will share with Intuit information on that user's PayPal transactions so that the information can be automatically entered by Intuit into the user's QuickBooks program.
If a user does not want his or her information shared with PayPal's co-branded partner, he or she should not use this aspect of the site.
If you choose to invest in the PayPal Money Market Reserve Fund, we will share your information with PayPal Funds, a Delaware business trust which is the issuer of the Money Market Reserve Fund, and with PayPal Asset Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal that is the transfer agent for the Money Market Reserve Fund, so that you can complete your investment more easily and can move funds into and out of the Money Market Reserve Fund without re-entering your personal information for every transaction.
==========
We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations.
For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in California.
However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.
==========
As with any other business, it is possible that PayPal in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company.
If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by PayPal, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described in Section A above.
Our Contacts with PayPal Customers
We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions.
We use your e-mail address to confirm your opening of a PayPal account, to send you notice of payments that you send or receive through PayPal (including referral payments described below), to send information about important changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law.
==========
Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.
We also use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including the PayPal Periodical newsletter, auction tips, customer surveys and notice of special third-party promotions.
You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account on the PayPal Web site and changing your preferences in the Profile page of the My Account tab.
You can also change your choices at any time through the same procedure.
==========
In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate.
However, these auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
Internet Address Information
We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Referral Program
When you sign up for a PayPal account, we send you an email with a unique referral link that you can forward to your friends.
The link identifies you as the referrer.
==========
If a friend uses that link to sign up and completes the bonus requirements, you are eligible for a referral bonus.
Alternatively, if you are the first user to send money to a friend
who is not a PayPal user, you are also eligible for a referral bonus.
In order for you to receive your bonus, your friend must sign up for PayPal and earn the $5 bonus by completing the new account bonus requirements.
Please use our referral program responsibly.
We strictly enforce our Anti-Spam Policy!

Bonus.
