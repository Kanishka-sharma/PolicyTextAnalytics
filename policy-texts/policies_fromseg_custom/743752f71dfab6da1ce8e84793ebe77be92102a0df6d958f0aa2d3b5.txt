Responsibility for Your Content
You alone are responsible for Your Content, and once published, it cannot always be withdrawn.
You assume all risks associated with Your Content, including anyone's reliance on its quality, accuracy, or reliability, or any disclosure by you of information in Your Content that makes you personally identifiable.
You represent that you own, or have the necessary permissions to use and authorize the use of Your Content as described herein.
You may not imply that Your Content is in any way sponsored or endorsed by Yelp.
==========
You may expose yourself to liability if, for example, Your Content contains material that is false, intentionally misleading, or defamatory; violates any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; contains material that is unlawful, including illegal hate speech or pornography; exploits or otherwise harms minors; or violates or advocates the violation of any law or regulation.
Our Right to Use Your Content
We may use Your Content in a number of different ways, including publicly displaying it, reformatting it, incorporating it into advertisements and other works, creating derivative works from it, promoting it, distributing it, and allowing others to do the same in connection with their own websites and media platforms ("Other Media").
As such, you hereby irrevocably grant us world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable rights to use Your Content for any purpose.
You also irrevocably grant the users of the Service and any Other Media the right to access Your Content in connection with their use of the Service and any Other Media.
Finally, you irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Yelp and its users any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.
By "use" we mean use, copy, publicly perform or display, distribute, modify, translate, and create derivative works of Your Content.

Ownership
As between you and Yelp, you own Your Content.
We own the Yelp Content, including but not limited to visual interfaces, interactive features, graphics, design, compilation, computer code, products, software, aggregate user review ratings, and all other elements and components of the Service excluding Your Content, User Content and Third Party Content.
We also own the copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and other intellectual and proprietary rights throughout the world (the "IP Rights") associated with the Yelp Content and the Service, which are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, trademark laws and all other applicable intellectual and proprietary rights and laws.
==========
As such, you may not modify, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works or adaptations of, publicly display or in any way exploit any of the Yelp Content in whole or in part except as expressly authorized by us.
Except as expressly and unambiguously provided herein, we do not grant you any express or implied rights, and all rights in and to the Service and the Yelp Content are retained by us.
Advertising
Yelp and its licensees may publicly display advertisements and other information adjacent to or included with Your Content.
You are not entitled to any compensation for such advertisements.
The manner, mode and extent of such advertising are subject to change without specific notice to you.
==========
Content Feeds
We make some of the Site Content (the "Feed Content") available via Real Simple Syndication and Atom feeds (the "Feeds").
You may access and use the Feeds in order to display Feed Content on your personal computer, website, or blog ("Your Site"), provided that (i) your use of the Feeds is for personal, non-commercial purposes only, (ii) your display of the Feed Content links back to the relevant pages on Yelp's websites, and attributes Yelp as the source of the Feed Content, (iii) your use or display of the Feed Content does not suggest that Yelp promotes or endorses any third party causes, ideas, websites, products or services, including Your Site, (iv) you do not redistribute the Feed Content, and (v) your use of the Feeds does not overburden Yelp's systems.
Yelp reserves all rights in the Feed Content and may terminate the Feeds at any time.
Please select "Partnerships" on our contacts page here to inquire about other possible uses of the Feeds.
==========
Other
We reserve the right to remove, screen, edit, or reinstate User Content from time to time at our sole discretion and without notice to you.
For example, we may remove a review if we believe it violates our Content Guidelines.
We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your Content, nor do we guarantee any confidentiality with respect to Your Content.
