Privacy Policy
This privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") applies to the collection of information by AppLovin Corporation ("we," "us," "Company," "our") on the AppLovin U.S. web site, currently located at www.Applovin.com (the "Site"), the AppLovin mobile applications (the "AppLovin Apps"), various third party Sites, and AppLovin's other online services.
It also applies to AppLovin's other information collection practices, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties.
==========
It also explains the conditions under which we use, store, and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to that information.
AppLovin is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.
By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the AppLovin Terms of Use Agreement.
1.
==========
Collection of Information.
1.1 Information Collection By Survey.
==========
AppLovin collects information from individuals primarily by having the individuals provide that information directly to AppLovin through its various services and surveys and other opportunities to share information.
Information collection may happen by various methods, including, but not limited to, an individual who transmits or receives a message through the Site by any means including, but not limited to, posts and text messages, when an individual supplies a photo either directly or through a third party link, when an individual voluntarily completes a AppLovin survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by AppLovin, and automatically collected information.
==========
For example, when you access the Site (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology.
This automatically collected information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, your listening preferences, the content and pages that you access on the Site, and the dates and times that you visit the Site, or third parties (collectively, a "Survey").
(As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Site, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.)
==========
In the Surveys, AppLovin or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to AppLovin, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, photo, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").
AppLovin may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site.
Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to AppLovin or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from AppLovin or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to AppLovin.
For certainty, the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy apply equally to the AppLovin Apps, and all terms and conditions applicable to the Site will apply likewise to the AppLovin Apps.
==========
1.2 Third Party List Information.
AppLovin may collect information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and AppLovin subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller").
Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information").
When acquiring Third Party List Information, AppLovin seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to AppLovin and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
1.3 Other Information.
==========
Other occasions when AppLovin obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by AppLovin or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through AppLovin's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a AppLovin service, including but not limited to applications, or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
AppLovin currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database.
Additionally, AppLovin may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
(a) Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows AppLovin to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in AppLovin's database.
You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com.
Individuals who use the Site need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Site.
==========
(b) Web Beacons.
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function - see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.
==========
This allows AppLovin to track certain web sites an individual visits online.
Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes.
For example, AppLovin might place, with the consent of a Third Party Site, a web beacon on the Third Party's Site where baseball products are sold.
When Joe, an individual listed in AppLovin's database, visits the baseball Site, AppLovin receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and AppLovin would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball.
AppLovin may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe.
In addition to using web beacons on web pages, AppLovin also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in AppLovin's database
(c) New Technology.
The use of technology on the Internet, including search engine indexing, cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is AppLovin's use of new and evolving technology.
As a result, AppLovin strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
==========
1.5 Outside Information.
AppLovin may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of AppLovin including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
1.6 Individual Information.
==========
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information AppLovin gathers or receives about individuals such as cellphone data (as described in Section 2.3 of this Privacy Policy).
1.7 No Information Collected from Children.
AppLovin does not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13.
If AppLovin obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.
Because it does not collect such information, AppLovin has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.
AppLovin has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
==========
1.8 Log File Information.
When users log-in to access their account, our servers may automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting the Site.
These server logs may include information vital to validating the user's authorization to access the account.
Information, such as a web request, Internet Protocol (the "IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order, time spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is necessary to validate and authorize a user's entry and activity on the Site.

==========
