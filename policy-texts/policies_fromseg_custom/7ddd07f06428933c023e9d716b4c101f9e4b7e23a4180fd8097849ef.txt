About Us
Woobox and its parent company, WOOBOX, LLC, and its related companies, collectively, we call "Woobox", provides software, Facebook enabled applications, websites and other online services to enable its business clients (Sponsors) to operate sweepstakes, contests, promotions, websites, website plugins, Facebook page apps, surveys, polls, and other market data gathering activities, collectively called Promotions or Services.
Woobox Promotion Software and Services are designed to allow Sponsors to gather personally identifiable information from Users who choose to enter a particular Promotion together with anonymous data regarding the Promotion itself.
This data is gathered for use by the Sponsors for various marketing purposes, including targeted marketing of its products.
Woobox takes its privacy obligations to both the people who enter the Promotions (Users) or (Entrants) and to its Sponsors very seriously and Woobox complies with various state, federal and international privacy policies.

Data Usage
To the extent Woobox collects personally identifiable information, it does so solely for the use of its Sponsors and the administration of the Promotions.
Woobox limits access to all personally identifiable information gathered within its organization and data is never shared outside of the company, with the exception of the Sponsors of the Promotions in which you decide to participate, or to comply with governmental or legal requests.
Woobox may contact you in connection with the Promotions you are a  participant and use your personally identifiable information collected from past Promotions when you access future Promotions or utilize the Woobox applications.
You may also grant Woobox permissions within Facebook applications running on our platform that allow us to share your activity within our applications on the Facebook platform and post on your behalf.
These permissions may or may not be required for you to participate in certain Promotions and you may revoke these permissions at any time in your Facebook privacy settings.
You may request that your collected personally identifiable information be deleted from Woobox systems at any time by sending your request to support@woobox.com.
