OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Except as provided below, Skype shall not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any personal and/or traffic data or communications content to any third party without your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or by order of the competent authorities.
Skype may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, to protect Skype’s interests, to enforce our policies or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.
In order to provide you with Skype products you have requested, Skype may sometimes, if necessary, share your personal and traffic data with Skype’s group companies, carriers, partner service providers and/or agents, for example the PSTN-VoIP gateway provider, Wifi access services providers, distributors of Skype software and/or Skype products, and/or the third party banking organizations or other providers of payment, email delivery, analytical services, customer support, or hosting services.
Skype will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.
Some Skype products may be co-branded and offered together with or via a  partner company.
If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Skype and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the co-branded product.
Skype may offer its products in connection with other websites or services or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both products/services or additional services and benefits.
To determine whether you would benefit from the combined offer, if you have provided your consent, Skype may match your email address, and email addresses of your contacts against email addresses you have provided to the third party website/service provider.
If you are a member of the Business Control Panel, detailed information about the activity on your Skype account including traffic data and details of your purchases and downloads may be accessed by the Administrator of the Business Control Panel if you have agreed to such access.
You can withdraw your agreement at any time by changing the settings on your account page on www.skype.com.
If you provide personal data including your name and job title to be included on the Business Control Panel directory, you acknowledge that such data may be viewed by other members of that Business Control Panel.
If you leave a voicemail for another Skype user, your voicemail message may be transferred to a third party service provider (where the Skype contact you are trying to reach has signed up to receive voicemails by text message), and will be converted to text.
The conversion process may in exceptional cases, require access by analysts.
By using the voicemail product, you consent to the processing of your voicemail message by Skype and its service provider.
Skype, Skype's local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or government authority lawfully requesting such information.
Skype will provide all reasonable assistance and information to fulfil this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure
Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Skype and its group companies maintain facilities, including outside of the EU.
==========
In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Skype reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country.
By using Skype software, Skype's websites or Skype products you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
As Skype continues to develop its business, Skype might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units.
In such transactions as well as in the event Skype or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Skype users will generally be one of the transferred business assets.
We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.
