Terms of Service
These Terms of Service ("TOS") contain important information; please read them carefully.
We also encourage you to review our Privacy Policy.
==========
Office.com, A Service From Winstar, is produced by Office.com Inc. ("OCI", "us", or "we").
OCI provides the Office.com site and various related services (together referred to as the "Site") subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service.
By using the Site, you are entering into a legal agreement with OCI to abide by these TOS.
==========
If you do not wish to be bound by the TOS, please exit the Site now.
Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the Site, or anything available on the Site, is to stop using the Site or the particular services.
==========
OCI may amend these TOS from time to time by updating this page.
Your continued use of the Site after revisions have been made will indicate your acceptance of the revised TOS.
Please bookmark and periodically review this page for updates to ensure that you are familiar with the most current version.
A link to this page appears on most Site pages.
==========
Children.
The Site is not targeted to children (people under thirteen years of age), nor do we provide services or sell products intended for use or purchase by children.
==========
To the extent that any child-related services or products are available on the Site, they are for use or purchase by adults.
Parental controls are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.
Current providers of these controls can be found here.
==========
If you are 13 or older but under the applicable legal age to enter into a binding contract, you must have a parent or guardian register for you.
If you are under 13, please do not register.
==========
Definitions: When used in these TOS, certain words have particular meanings:
OCI's "Affiliates" are all parties involved in creating, producing, and/or delivering the Site that have a relationship with OCI separate from these TOS, including our parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, information providers, partners, sponsors, contractors, advertisers, and suppliers of products and services to OCI.
An entity does not become an Affiliate just because they are a vendor in the Office.com Marketplace.
Nothing in these TOS create any obligations of any Affiliate to you, or gives you any rights against any Affiliate.
A "Third Party" is any entity other than OCI or our employees or agents when properly acting in that capacity.
==========
Something is "available on the Site" when a user is able to perceive or obtain it by using the Site, even if further, off-Site action (including payment) is needed.
For example, if you contract for services with a company, and the Site's only role was that you read a news article about it, those services are still "available on the Site" for purposes of these TOS.
"Material" on the Site refers to any product, service, information, content, and anything else available on the Site, regardless of its source.
A "Submission" is anything that a user transmits to the Site (regardless of ultimate destination) other than a private e-mail message.
When a form of the word "include" is used to give specific examples of something, it's not meant to exclude any other possibilities.
Copyright and Trademark
You should assume that the Site and all of its contents and components (including Submissions, underlying code, graphics, etc.) are copyrighted, and that, except for a single copy for your personal use only, you may not copy, resell, or redistribute any part of the Site in any manner without the express written permission of the owner(s).

Nothing in these TOS grants you any right to use any trademark, service mark, logo, or trade name of OCI or any Third Party.
