What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address.
When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the internet.com Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address.
The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site.

Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.
