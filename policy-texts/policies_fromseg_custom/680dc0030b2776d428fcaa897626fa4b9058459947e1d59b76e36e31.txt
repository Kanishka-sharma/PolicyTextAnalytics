Dispute
Resolution

any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement
including the documents it incorporates by reference, your use of our web site

third party, or your participation in meetups (whether the dispute, claim or

you or MEETUP may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a Court of
competent jurisdiction in New York, New York necessary to protect the rights or
property of you or MEETUP pending the completion of arbitration.
12.2 Negotiation.
Either party may initiate negotiations by providing written
notice in letter form to the other party, setting forth the subject of the
dispute and the relief requested.
The recipient of such notice will respond in
writing within fifteen (15) business days with a statement of its position on
and recommended solution to the dispute.
If the dispute is not resolved by this exchange of correspondence, then
representatives of each party with full settlement authority will meet in
person or otherwise at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty (30)
business days of the date of the initial notice in order to exchange relevant
information and perspectives, and to attempt to resolve the dispute.
==========
12.3 Mediation.
Either party may commence mediation by providing
to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the
subject of the dispute and the relief requested.
The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in
selecting a mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the
mediation proceedings.
The parties
agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they
will share equally in its costs.
All
offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the
course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts
and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential,
privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any
arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence
that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible
or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.
Either party may initiate arbitration with
respect to the matters submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for
arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or forty-five
(45) days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever
occurs first.
==========
The mediation may
continue after the commencement of arbitration if the parties so desire.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the
mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator in the case.
12.4 Arbitration.
The parties agree that any and all disputes,
claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are
not resolved by their mutual agreement by negotiation or mediation under
Sections 12.2 and 12.3 shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration
before JAMS, or its successor, pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. Sec.
1 et seq.
==========
Either party may
commence the arbitration process called for in this Agreement by filing a
written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party.
The arbitration will be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration.
The parties will cooperate with JAMS and
with one another in selecting an arbitrator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and
in scheduling the arbitration proceedings.
The parties covenant that they will participate in the arbitration in
good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.

The provisions of Sections 12.3 and 12.4 may be enforced by any Court of
competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to
an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be paid
by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.
