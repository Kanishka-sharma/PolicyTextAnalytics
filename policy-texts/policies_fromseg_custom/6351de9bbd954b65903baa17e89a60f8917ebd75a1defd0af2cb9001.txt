For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.

The special categories of personal information are information relating to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, health or sex life, sexual orientation; genetic or biometric information.
If we do collect special category personal information, we will ask for your explicit consent, or rely on an alternative appropriate lawful basis (such as because the processing relating to personal information is manifestly made public) to our proposed use of that information at the time of collection.
==========
Disclosure of your information
We may share your personal information with any entity within Stats Perform as necessary to carry out the purposes for which the information was supplied or collected (for example, to provide our services to you).
Personal information will also be shared with our third-party service providers, sub-contractors and business partners who assist with the running of the Websites and the operation of our business including hosting providers and CRM solution providers.
Our third-party service providers and business partners are subject to our written contracts with them, security and confidentiality obligations and are only permitted to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
In addition, Stats Perform may disclose information about you to the following third parties:
in respect of technical information about your website browsing actions, advertisers and advertising networks that require the information to select and serve relevant adverts to you;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site;
in the event that Stats Perform sells the business (or part of it) operating our services, buys a new business, or it is integrated with another business, in which case we may disclose your personal information to our advisers and any prospective buyer’s or seller’s advisers as well as to the new owners of the business (whichever the case may be);

Security
We understand that the security of your personal information is important to you.
When handling personal information, security is paramount and we seek to ensure that personal information is adequately and appropriately protected.
We use appropriate, technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorised access, use or modification.
Despite these precautions, and although we will do our best to protect your personal information, Stats Perform cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted over the Internet or that unauthorised persons will not obtain access to personal information.
In the event of a data breach, we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where required to do so.
==========
International Data Transfers 
We are a global business.
This means that your personal information may be transferred to or accessed from outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) in countries which are not governed by data protection laws equivalent to those in force within the European Union (“EU”).
It may be necessary for us to transfer your personal information outside of the country in which it was collected or your jurisdiction of residence when transferring it to other entities within Stats Perform and our service providers and business partners located in other countries.
==========
Also, we exchange personal information between our offices located globally.
When such transfers take place, safeguards are in place to protect your personal information, as set out below.
==========
Where, by way of example, personal information is transferred from the EEA to and stored in a country not determined by the European Commission as providing adequate levels of protection for personal information (such as India or Australia) or information is transferred from the EEA to a recipient  in the US which is not certified under the Privacy Shield, we take steps to ensure such transfers are in accordance with data protection laws and provide appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including entering into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, obliging recipients to protect your personal information.
How Long We Retain Your Personal Information 
We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer period is permitted or required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes, where there is a prospect of litigation or to protect our legal rights.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
==========
Unsubscribing from  Marketing
Please see the “Marketing” section above.
Your Rights
You have the following rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you:
You can access a copy of the personal information we hold about you (commonly known as a “data subject access request”).
==========
You are entitled to the correction of the personal information that we hold about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate.
You have the right for the deletion or removal of personal information we hold about you where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it or where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
You have the right for our processing of your personal information to be restricted in certain circumstances, for example if you want to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
==========
You can obtain a copy of the personal information you’ve provided us in a structured and commonly used format so that it can be transferred to a third party of your choice (commonly known as a “data portability request”).
The right to data portability only applies where your personal information is processed by us with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you and when processing is carried out by automated means.
You can withdraw any consent you have provided to our use of your personal information.
Where you withdraw consent, we will stop using your information for the specific purpose unless we have an alternative legal basis to use it.
Where we are processing your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests, you can ask us to stop processing it and we must do so unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
==========
Please note that some of the above rights are not absolute and we may be entitled to refuse requests, wholly or partly, where exceptions under the applicable law apply.
For example, (a) we may refuse a request for erasure of personal information where the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or (b) we may refuse to comply with a request for restriction if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
==========
You can exercise any of your rights as described in this Privacy Policy and under data protection laws by contacting us as provided in the Contacting Us section above.
Save as described in this Privacy Policy or provided under data protection laws, there is no charge for the exercise of your legal rights.
==========
However, if your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.
Where we have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the person making the request, we may ask for proof of identity before dealing with the request.
==========
If you are dissatisfied with how we have handled your personal information, and you are located in the EU, you have the right to make a complaint to your relevant EU data protection regulator (in the UK, this would be the Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/)) and we will work with the relevant regulator to resolve it.
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the regulator, so please do contact us in the first instance using the details in the Contacting Us section above where we will try our best to handle any queries or concerns.

 This Privacy Policy is dated September 16, 2019.
