Publisher’s Internationalé, Pty Ltd , Privacy Policy
Effective as of Jan, 2018



Introduction
 Pi-rate is a global provider of digital advertising media and data management technology.
Pi-rate’s proprietary Publisher’s Internationale Pty Ltd activates data, automates execution, and optimizes advertising interactions across addressable media — delivering greater performance, transparency, and control to marketers and a better experience to consumers.
This privacy policy ("Policy") sets out how Pi-rate processes information collected via our Platform and on our website at www.Pi-rate.com.au (the "Website").
It also sets out our practices regarding our use of such information, the steps we take to protect it, as well as the choices and rights that consumers ("users", "you", "your") have regarding how we collect and process information about them.
In this Policy, we use the terms "Pi-rate", "our", "us" and "we" to refer to Pi-rate.
and our affiliates.
Pi-rate is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers when we process information about them via our Platform and the users of our Website.
We adhere to applicable industry guidelines and will continue to review and update our Policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of personal information.
Pi-rate is an active member of the industry associations that govern the policies around online consumer privacy in the context of interest-based advertising, including: The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) in Australia and Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) 		
		  



The Pi-rate Platform
Data Collection and Use
In the course of delivering an ad to you via the Platform, Pi-rate does not intentionally collect information that reveals your real-world identity, such as your name, address, phone number, or Social Security Number.
==========
Pi-rate collects data about your computer or device through the use of cookies, web-beacons and other similar technologies, as explained below.
This information is pseudonymous and is not considered to be personal information in many jurisdictions in which we operate.
In some other jurisdictions in which we operate, in certain contexts, such information, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other pseudonymous information, may be considered personal information.
The information Pi-rate collects includes common information found in every communication sent over the Internet, from which we infer such things as: browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows); browser language (e.g., English or Spanish); Internet Protocol (IP) address; Internet Service Provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon); and mobile advertising identifier, for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
Pi-rate's clients may also use the platform to collect data regarding your interactions with them, including your use of our client's sites and mobile apps, the sites and apps our clients advertise on, and other pages on the Internet.
We may also capture additional data in order to calculate a statistical ID, as described below.
==========
We may also receive Precise Location Data (as defined by the NAI) generated from your use of your mobile device, such as the latitude/longitude coordinates provided by a mobile app publisher or other media supply source in conjunction with the opportunity to purchase advertising inventory.
Pi-rate may transfer such Precise Location Data to clients and partners, including for use in targeting ads based on the current location of the device.
When we process Precise Location Data, the mobile app publisher or other media supply source is responsible for enabling you to provide or withdraw consent with respect to the collection and use of your Precise Location Data.
==========
We and our clients and partners use the information we collect to create data segments, and these data segments are generally based upon your interactions with our clients or other third-party media suppliers, such as the websites that you visit and the mobile applications that you use.
The categories of data segments vary, and our clients may use life style segments such as an inferred interest in beauty and travel.
Where Pi-rate creates segments as a result of your interactions occurring within the EU, Pubintl AU is the controller of your personal data processed within these segments.
==========
We also receive pseudonymous information from third parties, when they choose to provide it to us.
This information may include identifiers (like mobile advertising IDs) and interest-based advertising data tied to those identifiers, including segments provided by third-party data providers for our clients to use in targeting ads through the Platform.
Pi-rate does not use this data to personally identify you.
We may assign a Pi-rate ID to your browser, computer or mobile device when we serve an ad to it or we identify it on a client’s website or mobile app.
The Pi-rate ID may be stored in a cookie on your computer or mobile device.
==========
It helps us understand your interests and deliver more relevant ads to you.
The Pi-rate ID and other information collected via the Platform can also help our advertising clients measure your activity on their sites and determine the effectiveness of advertisements delivered via the Platform.
This information can then be used by our advertising clients to better cater to your needs and deliver ads to you for the types of products and services in which you might be interested.
None of these technologies enable us to personally identify an individual.
==========
Instead, they enable the Platform to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a computer or device is the same as one with which the Platform has previously interacted.
For instance, the Platform can determine that a browser or device to which we served an ad on Monday may be the same browser or device for which we observed a purchase on Tuesday.
In some cases, Pi-rate is able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or mobile device should be associated with the same Pi-rate ID that we have previously assigned to another computer or mobile device.
In other words, in such cases we are able to infer that a device (e.g. your computer) and another device (e.g. your smartphone) are used by the same user.
==========
Where we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices, and to improve the services we provide to our clients.
We use the information that we collect directly and the information that we obtain from third parties to create segments, run analytics, target ads, and measure the effectiveness of ads on behalf of Pi-rate’s clients.
We also use it to improve our Platform and the products and services that we provide to our clients, and to create new products and services.
For these purposes we may share information with our clients, partners and service providers.
While Pi-rate does not knowingly create data segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we don’t create any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes, nor do we create segments of EU consumers based on personal data considered to be sensitive in the EU, e.g. information about physical or mental health or condition, sex life, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs), our clients may use the Platform to process some sensitive information, which may come from our clients’ sites or our partners.
We take steps designed to ensure that this is done in compliance with applicable laws and self-regulatory guidelines, including through our contracts and policies with our clients and partners.
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Ad Targeting Technologies
Like most digital marketing platforms, Pi-rate uses "cookies", mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to enhance users’ experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads, and for ad delivery and reporting via the Platform.
We use these technologies to help recognize a computer or device so that we and our clients are able to deliver relevant advertising to you, measure the impact of that advertising and better understand and recognize digital media usage patterns.
==========
The types of technologies used via the Platform include:

•  Cookies – Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters.
Pi-rate uses cookies to uniquely identify an Internet browser.
Certain browsers or browser settings sometimes block cookies, and cookies may not work effectively on some mobile devices.
For more information about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
•  Mobile Advertising Identifiers – Mobile advertising IDs (e.g., Apple’s IDFA or Google’s AAID) are unique IDs that are associated with individual mobile devices and that do not reveal your real world identity.
They usually are user-resettable.
==========
•  Pixel Tags – Pixel tags (also commonly known as web beacons) are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that our clients and partners use to understand how consumers interact with them online, including on websites and in mobile apps.
These technologies are used to identify a computer or device within a certain level of confidence that enables the Platform to function and serve more relevant ads.
Data Retention on the Platform
We retain the Pi-rate ID and, where applicable, its association with other devices for as long as this is necessary for our legitimate business purposes.
==========
Lifespan of cookie ids in the system is 1 year ~365 days unless cookie has been refreshed by the user.
This is used for the purpose of showing relevant ad to the user.
Lifespan of rest of the ids in the system is 3 months.
==========
Opt-Out
You may opt out from Pi-rate tracking and interest-based advertising at any time through one of the ways described below.
If you wish to opt out of Pi-rate tracking and interest-based advertising on both internet browsers and mobile applications, you need to opt out separately for each browser or device via the methods described below.
Two Reasons You May Not Want to opt Out
Advertising supports the free Internet.
==========
It is the primary way that most website and app publishers make money in order to produce the content consumers want.
Not all advertising shown to consumers is relevant to their interests, though.
Interest-based advertising is advertising that tries to make the ads you see more interesting and relevant to you based on the types of sites you visit online and other information that does not personally identify you.
We conduct interest-based advertising on our Website, and work with our clients to help them do the same on their websites and apps.
==========
Without interested-based advertising, you will still see ads, but those ads are not likely to have anything to do with products or services you care about.
With interest-based advertising, you receive ads and offers that are more likely to be useful to you.
There is also a second benefit to you: companies that create websites and apps rely on the revenue from interest-based advertising to support the rich array of content they produce.
Without that revenue, the content would either be unavailable or consumers would have to pay for it.
==========
What does it mean to opt-out?
In general, “opting out” means that you want Pi-rate to limit the information it collects and stores about your computer or device and to not target ads that are based on your interests to your browser or device.
You opt-out is only applicable to the Pi-rate Platform and does not opt you out from platforms provided by third-party companies.
However, you can out from both Pi-rate and many third-party companies at once; to do so, please see “Other ways to opt out” below.
If you use multiple browsers, computers or mobile devices and wish to limit the information Pi-rate collects and stores or do not wish to receive Pi-rate interest-based advertising on any of them, you must opt out from each browser, computer, and mobile device individually.
==========
Please note that if cookies are not enabled in your browser, or if you use certain ad-blocking tools, our opt-out mechanism may not work properly.
Please also note that deleting your cookies does not opt you out.

Please click on below button for cookie opt out.
Click here to opt out

When you opt out, we record the opt-out on our servers and in browser environments we will attempt to place an HTTP opt-out cookie onto your computer or device.
==========
When you opt out, Pi-rate will collect and store information from your browser or device only as needed to honouryours opt-out and for limited research and development purposes to improve our browser- and device-recognition technology, which also helps to improve our ability to honouryours opt-out.
When you opt out, Pi-rate also stops targeting interest-based advertising to that browser.
Please note that if you clear your cookies, or if you use a different browser or device, you will need to renew yours opt-out choice.
