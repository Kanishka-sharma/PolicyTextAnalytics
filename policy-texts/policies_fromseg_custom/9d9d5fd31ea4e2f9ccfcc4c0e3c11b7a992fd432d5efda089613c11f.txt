Schools and Student Use
This School and Student Use notice supplements our Privacy Policy in connection with school use.
Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free educational content.
We strive to implement best practices to protect the privacy of all of our student and non-student users, alike.
==========
We have implemented additional controls and procedures for schools, school districts and teachers (collectively referred to as “Schools”) when they use the Service for educational purposes.
When the Service is used as part of the School’s educational program, the personal information related to the School’s student users (“School Users”) may include information defined as “education records” by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or other information protected by similar state student data privacy laws.
We refer to this information as “Student Personal Data”.
==========
Our commitment:We are proud supporters of the Student Privacy Pledge.
Our collection and use of Student Personal Data is governed by our contracts with Schools, by our Privacy Policy, and by applicable privacy laws.
For example, we work with Schools to protect Student Personal Data consistent with FERPA and, for School Users under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a School User, please contact your School directly.
==========
Creation of School Accounts: Please note that in order for School User accounts to be associated with a School and recognized as School Accounts (as defined in our Terms of Service), the accounts must be created by or at the direction of a School, using a school email address and associated with a School’s class on the Service.
For example, a School Account is created when:
a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School User accounts and creates a class on the Service
a teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service for School use
an account is created by a School User at the direction of a School, using a School email address and associated with a School’s class on the Service
accounts are created pursuant to a separate contract between Khan Academy and the school district (or educational agency) specifying that the accounts are School Accounts
In cases where we do not have a separate contract with a School district or educational agency, we may require notification that the accounts are used for school purposes in order to recognize them as School Accounts.
If you are a School, please contact our School Partnerships Team to learn more about how to ensure that student accounts are set up and managed as School Accounts.

For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect personal information relating to Children (“Child Users”).
When a Child creates an account, we seek the consent of a parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) for that account.
