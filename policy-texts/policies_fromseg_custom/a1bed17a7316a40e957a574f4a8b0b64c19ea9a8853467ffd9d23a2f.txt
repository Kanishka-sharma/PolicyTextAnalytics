Other Important Info
Advertising and Analytics
You may see T‑Mobile and other advertisements on your devices - whether you are connected to our network or not.
These ads may be targeted to your device based on information that we, the advertiser, and other third parties have about your behavior or interests to make them more useful to you.
These ads are called interest-based or targeted ads.
Like most companies, T‑Mobile works with third parties, including advertising networks, which collect information about you through devices, websites, and apps, serve ads for us and others, and measure their effectiveness.
The advertisers and third parties that provide these ads may use cookies, code, and web beacons or use mobile device identifiers and similar technologies for these activities.
For example, third parties like Google Ad Manager and Nielsen may use technology to collect data to deliver, personalize, and measure ads for some of our Products and Services.
This technology allows tracking of device activity over time across online properties.
The advertisers and advertising networks’ use of these technologies and of the information collected is covered by their own privacy notices and those of the sites where they operate.
T‑Mobile may also use its own online advertising services in connection with these ad activities.
We may also partner with analytic service providers like Google Analytics to help track your use of our products and services.
To learn more about how Google collects and processes personal data, visit https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.
For additional details, see the Cookies and Tracking Technology article.
==========
We follow the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
To learn more see our Advertising and Analytics  article.
For more information on our ad program and your choices, go to the Advertising Choices section.
==========
Do Not Track signals are a web browser setting or mechanism used to indicate that you do not want your online activity tracked.
Because there is no universal standard of how to apply the that setting, we currently do not honor them.
However, we honor Do Not Sell settings.
==========
Geolocation Data
If your mobile device is turned on, our network is collecting data about where it is.
We may use, provide access to, or disclose this network location data without your permission to provide and support our services.
Examples include to: 

route wireless communications;
operate and improve our network and business;
detect and prevent fraud;
provide information to emergency responders about where to find you when you call public safety agencies, including through 911 or similar emergency services numbers; or
as required by law.
Subject to your settings, we and others may also use location data to provide location-based services (like SyncUP PETS), or to personalize your experience and ads.

Internet of Things
We provide connectivity to Internet of Things devices and services offered by other companies.
==========
We collect basic information about the information flowing over our network.
However, if you are a customer of a T‑Mobile IoT service, we, and our apps providers, also collect information from the IoT device and any related app to support the service.
The information varies depending on the service but may include personal data like contact information and location, audio, and device activity and measurement data.
Data Retention
We retain your personal data for business or tax needs, or legal reasons.
==========
Technologies in Retail Stores
In some of our retail stores, beacons have been deployed and we receive aggregate reports (none of which identify any individual or device) from these stores regarding store traffic that uses information collected from beacons through mobile apps.
We may also use technology that tracks aggregate traffic patterns and wait times in our stores using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth identifiers (e.g., a MAC address).
We will provide a notice at each location where we use this technology.
If you don’t want your device used this way, opt out at any time by entering your MAC address at https://optout.smart-places.org.
==========
Unaffiliated Third Parties
Our products and services provide links and access to others’ websites, content services, and apps, and allow you to share personal data with others and to use products and services that T‑Mobile does not control.
These third parties may collect your personal data.
==========
For example, we may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our products and services with other media, and vice versa.
Your use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.
Look for their privacy notices to see what personal data they collect, share, and use, as we of course do not have any control over those practices.
For additional details, check out our article on Device Apps.
==========
US-Based Organization
T‑Mobile is headquartered in the United States and our data processing mostly happens in the United States.
Your personal data may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States or in other countries where our affiliates or service providers process data.
International Data Privacy
T‑Mobile’s international services, previously provided by Sprint and now part of T‑Mobile for Business, are directed to business customers.
Users of T‑Mobile's international services are typically employees of those business customers, or prospective business customers, and personal data that we collect will generally be limited to information collected or generated in a business context.
T‑Mobile’s International Data Privacy Notice describes the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, and processing of personal data we collect outside the United States.
