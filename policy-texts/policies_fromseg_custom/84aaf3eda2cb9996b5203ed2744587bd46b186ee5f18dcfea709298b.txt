In a nutshell: 
 Your Privacy and Security are a Top Priority at iHerb.
Since our inception back in 1996, iHerb has never shared, rented, or sold any customer information to any other party-- and never will.
==========
When you submit personal information on our website we will protect your information both online and offline.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it.
For example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited access, secured facilities.
==========
iHerb.com employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures.
And as always, iHerb.com will never sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other parties.
==========
And we will only disclose your information to the extent we are required to do so by law or a court order.
iHerb takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized disclosure or access.
==========
However, no data transmitted over the internet or stored on a server can ever be 100% secured.
Therefore, while we strive to protect your privacy and personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted or disclosed to us online.
We are not responsible for the disclosure, destruction or theft of your personal information.
If you opted to register with us, you established a password for your account, in which case your online account information will be protected by your password.
==========
We suggest that you do not share disclose your password to anyone.
You are responsible for the confidentiality of your account and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and password.
We suggest creating challenging passwords such as those with alphanumeric combinations.
==========
Secure Ordering
When you submit personal information on our website, your information is protected both online and offline.
We can only access your credit card (but not your actual credit card information) to issue credits, never for actual charges.
Only you can produce a charge by placing an order in your password-protected account.
==========
While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon of your web browser becomes locked.
This indicates that the connection between your web browser and our web server is secured.
While on a secure page, the 'http' on your browser changes to 'https'.
==========
When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software which meets or exceeds industry standards - (Secure Socket Layer).
While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
==========

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
==========
Correcting/Updating Personal Information
If you need to correct or update your personal information (such as your email address), or if you no longer desire our service, you can let us know by emailing our customer support at info@iHerb.com or calling 951.616.3600.
Notification of Changes
If we change our privacy policy, we will post a notice of the change on our homepage, so you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we would disclose it.
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our Web site 30 days prior to implementing the change.
You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.
