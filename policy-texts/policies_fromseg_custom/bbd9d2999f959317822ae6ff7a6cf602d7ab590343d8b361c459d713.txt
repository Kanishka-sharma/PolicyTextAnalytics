Disqus reserves the right to change these Terms at any time.
We recommend that you periodically check this Site for changes.
==========
Usage License
Disqus grants you a limited license to access the Site and use the Services in accordance with these Terms and the instructions and guidelines posted on the Site.
Disqus reserves the right to terminate your license to use the Site and Services at any time and for any reason or in the future charge for commercial usage.
User Responsibility
You are solely responsible for your use of the Site and Services.
==========
Because Disqus merely serves as a repository of information, user-posted content does not represent the advice, views, opinions or beliefs of Disqus, and Disqus makes no claim of accuracy of any user-posted material.
Disqus allows for the posting of user comments, and may include links to third-party websites.
These comments, and any linked websites' content, business practices and privacy policies are not under our control, and we are not responsible for the content of any user comments, linked website or any link contained in a linked website.
The inclusion of user comments and/or links on the Site or Services does not imply any endorsement by or any affiliation with Disqus.
In a ccessing the Site and Services, reading user comments, or following links to third-party websites you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive or inappropriate .
You agree that your only recourse is to stop using the Site and Services.
User-Posted Content
By posting content, you are granting permission to us and others to access and use it in connection with the Services, the Site and otherwise in connection with our business.
==========
For your content, you can label your compilations with one of several possible licenses.
It is important to note that you can only copyright the compilation itself, not the individual links that make up the compilation.
Please also note that just because your compilation does not have a license agreement attached to it does not mean that it is public domain.
For a compilation to be classified as such, it must be explicitly labeled as belonging to the public domain.
==========
Your use of a license in connection with your compilation does not affect Disqus's right to access and use it in connection with the Services, the Site or otherwise in connection with our business.
Disqus does not provide legal services, and therefore, providing you with the ability to attach a license agreement to your compilation of links does not create an attorney-client relationship.
The license agreements and all related information are provid ed on an "as is" basis.
==========
Disqus makes no warranties whatsoever regarding the license agreements and the information provided, and disclaims all liability for damages, including without limitation, any general, special, incidental or consequential damages, resulting from their use.
Disqus will include this license label in making your content accessible to others, but any enforcement of your chosen license terms remains your sole responsibility.
Disqus is explicitly not responsible for the manner or circumstances by which third parties access or use public content and is under no obligation to disable or otherwise restrict this access.
Disqus provides you with the ability to remove your personal information from the Site and the Services.
This ability does not extend to copies that others may have made or to copies that we may have made for backup purposes.
==========
Feeds and API
Disqus provides access to portions of its Site and Services via RSS feeds and an API; for the purposes of these Terms, such access constitutes use of the Site and Services.
Disqus asks that you use these features respectfully, as outlined in the documentation.
You may not use these or any other features or the Site itself to allow the display of a substantial portion of the Disqus database or reproduce, duplicate or copy the Disqus Site.
Disqus reserves the right to change these features at any time and to disable access to the feeds and the API at any time for any reason.
