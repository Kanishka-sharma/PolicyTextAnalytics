How does Ligatus use your personal information
Personal information is also requested by us for billing and promotional purposes and processed by us or by our partners and customers (e.g. when ordering information or premiums).
The usage of your personal information varies depending on the relevant campaign and customer.
You will be informed thoroughly about any usage of your personal information on the relevant website or within the relevant campaign.
Your personal information is not used for purposes that you did explicitly agree to when requesting our services or within the scope of the relevant campaign.
==========
Without your consent, your information will not be used e.g. for marketing purposes.
You will only receive advertising if you have given your explicit consent.
You can revoke your consent any time by using our contact form or sending an email to info@ligatus.com.
==========
However, in this case Ligatus may no longer be able to provide the offered services.
In addition to personal information collected about you via our contact forms or microsites operated on behalf of our customers or business partners, which will strictly be used to provide the relevant services to you, our web servers log general information on the usage of our websites (such as: date and time, visited websites - e.g. when each page was viewed or which page was visited most frequently).
Such log data is processed for system security reasons (to prevent abuse of our web services), to improve our websites and web services and as well for statistical purposes (number of users and page views).
==========
However, we do not analyse personal information.
Delivery of personalised or behaviour-based advertising (behavioral targeting)
In certain cases, we showcase advertising to you on the websites of our partners and for our customers, which are automatically selected on the basis of your surfing behaviour, in order to optimise the quality of the advertising notices for you (so-called "personalised" or "behaviour-based" advertising delivery and "behavioral targeting".
The objective of this system is to only demonstrate to you those commercials which may correspond to your interests.
Advertising notices which are unlikely to be of interest to you or which are irrelevant will not be shown to you by the activated behavioral targeting system of Ligatus and will be disabled.
==========
In such a case, this section 4 of the data protection declaration applies as part of the respective web-based services of our partners or customers, from which (for example under "data protection" or "data protection declaration" direct reference was made or a link was created.
We wish to disclose to you in a transparent manner how the behavioral targeting works, which data is gathered in the process, how this data is used and for what purpose and how you can object to the behavioral targeting function at any time and block it.
As a German/Europeancompany, the protection of your data is a priority for Ligatus, also in the course of the delivery of behaviour-based advertising and Ligatus only uses anonymised data to improve advert quality.
Therefore, an identification of your person is not possible either for Ligatus or the respective operator of the website of our partners and customers which you are visiting.
You can yourself decide at any time whether you would like to continue seeing personalised banner from Ligatus.
==========
User data is processed exclusively in European computer centres.
Ligatus has voluntarily obliged itself to comply with the OBA framework of the EDAA / AB Europe and provides regular proof of this within the framework of its annual certification in accordance with these parameters.
a) How does behavioral targeting work in individual cases?
==========
When visiting the website of one of our partners or customers, a cookie file is stored on your computer.
Cookies are small text files which are deposited by your web browser in a folder on your computer which is designated for this purposes and which contains a single character string as a means of identification.
The cookie does not store your IP address or any data that allows you to be identified.
The same character string is also saved on our servers.
The next time you visit one of our partners' websites, only the character string is read which identifies the Internet browser you are using.
This allows us, for example, to identify which page you have accessed for our partner and which advert you have been shown, without this being linked to your identity.
Furthermore, all of the cookies created by us are given an expiry data and automatically expire after no more than 13 months.
Without a valid cookie file, the character strong saved on our servers is no longer to be assigned for us.
==========
Important: Using cookies we cannot ever collect your personal data.
For example, when you enter an email address or delivery address, or any other personal data, we cannot see your input and cannot therefore process or store it.
We do not know your name, address or workplace, nor do we know your gender, age, email address or any other personally identifiable information about you.
Even the IP address of your computer is not stored!
==========
You can view the data stored in the cookie on your computer.

c) How can I disable personalised advertising from Ligatus banners?
If you do not agree to the storing of cookies by us, you can check your cookie status at any time here and disable the storage of retargeting cookies by us and therefore decline personalised adverts from Ligatus.
This means that in future you will receive random advertising that is not targeted to your interests.
Please note that the "opt-out" and "opt-in" functions offered are also controlled using cookies.
This means that deleting all cookies on your computer means that you will have to opt-out again.
==========
It is also the case that the deletion of all cookies on your computer does not lead to no personalised advertising being notified to you on a permanent basis.
Therefore, you must use the following link to the "opt out" function which is provided, should you not wish for behaviour-based advertising to be delivered to your computer or your end devices.
At the following address http://www.ligatus.com/en/privacy-policy#cookie_status you can change your current cookie status at any time.
==========
Finally, please note that we are continuously expanding our range of products.
As this will technically involve a new system, the introduction of a new opt-out may be necessary, even if you have already opted prior to its introduction.
d) Can other forms of personalised advertising be disabled in addition to Ligatus?
The options described in this section refer only to the personalised adverts offered by Ligatus.
If you wish to disable personalised advertising from other providers, you can do this via their respective websites.
