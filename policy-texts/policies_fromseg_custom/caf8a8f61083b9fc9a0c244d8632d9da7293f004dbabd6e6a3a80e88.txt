How We Keep Your Information Secured
CVS.com has advanced security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for the areas of our site where we ask you to provide personally identifiable information.
You can tell you've entered one of these areas when you look at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in your browser's address bar and see it has "https://" before the rest of the Web address.
==========
The "s" means that page is hosted from a secured server.
We use secured servers for our Registration and Sign In pages as well as all the other pages that are part of processing an order.
Also, we sometimes use secured pages for special promotions such as our "Win a Maid for a Day" contest.
==========
SSL allows us to guarantee that the personal information you give us will be transmitted safely because the information is encrypted.
Encryption involves systematically scrambling numbers and letters so if someone managed to intercept that packet of information, they would not be able to make sense of it.
==========
Our product and health information areas--the Store Aisles, Pharmacy Counter, and Healthier Living sections--are hosted from servers that do not use SSL.
Since we do not collect personal information in these areas, using regular servers allows us to provide a quicker shopping experience.
Encrypting information, as we do in the "https://" areas, makes the process of sending information across the Internet much slower.
==========
Unsecured pages have URLs that begin with "http://".
You may encounter a standard warning that many browsers display when a visitor moves from a "secured" page to an "unsecured" page.
Usually, when you encounter such a warning at CVS.com, it means that you are moving from an "https://" to an "http://" page.
Our site meets stringent security and privacy standards for both e-commerce and personal information.
Providing a secure shopping experience is one of our greatest priorities at CVS.com.
If you see other browser warnings or error messages concerning the security of our site, please Contact Us.
Include the specific wording you saw and where at CVS.com you encountered the message.
Providing us with these details helps us to know if you've encountered a technical difficulty or a standard warning like the one described above.
==========
Personal Information Gathered
Contact Information:
 We collect information about how to reach you at the time you register as a CVS.com customer.
Providing us with your name, email address, and telephone number allows us to contact you if a problem in our verification process will delay delivery or there is other exceptional handling of your order required.
==========
For example, if a health warning is issued or a drug recall occurs, we'll be able to quickly contact you.
This information also allows us to reach you if we receive other important medical information while filling your prescription that will be of value to you.
Health Information:
	 When you order prescription drugs, we ask a few brief questions about your medical history.
==========
Many state boards of pharmacy require that we ask you for this information.
Our pharmacists use this information to ensure that the medication prescribed is safe and effective for you.
==========
Billing Information:
	 We ask for credit card and health insurance information.
We will bill your credit card for nonprescription items and shipping charges.
Having all of this data allows us to bill your insurance company for prescribed medications and to charge to your account only the copayment that your insurance company requires.
For more detailed information, visit Prescription Prices, Payments, and Benefits.
==========
Site Traffic and Usage Patterns:
	 Like many other Web sites, we also collect information about you and your use of our site through the use of cookies and Web server logs.
Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer's hard drive.
These small text files help us personalize content on our pages--this is how we're able to greet you with your name when you return to CVS.com, for instance.
We also use cookies to provide you with timely discounts like our e-Coupon program.
Reviewing our server logs and our customers' CVS.com use of cookies helps us statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.
==========
These reports help us to identify our best selling products and to provide our partners and sponsors with general information about how well a specific promotion fared.
Only authorized CVS.com personnel have access to Web server logs, cookie utilization data, and purchase history information.
==========
These employees are held to strict confidentiality and security policies and procedures.
Your personally identifiable information is removed before any information is passed to the database we use to generate reports.
==========
Thus, any business related reports a CVS.com analyst creates is based on aggregate information only and can not be directly linked to any one customer's identity.
Our Privacy Guarantee:
	 CVS.com is the sole collector and owner of this information.
==========
We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party, unless legally required to do so.
We may share nonpersonal, summary, or aggregate customer data with partners and other third parties.
==========
If you choose to pick up your CVS.com order or to use our Express Refills service, we'll send your contact and medical information to only the CVS/pharmacy store you select.
Your CVS pharmacist will send us updates regarding the status of your order.
==========
How We Use Your Personal Information
CVS.com's mission is to enable people to live healthier lives by providing excellent service, products and information.
Your contact, health and billing information enables us to deliver the best health, wellness and prescription products to you.
Trusting us with your medical history allows our pharmacists to watch for potentially dangerous interactions in medicines you order at CVS.com.
Your good health is important to us.
==========
Full-Service Pharmacy
Teaming up with our parent company allows us to offer more choices for getting prescriptions filled.
For customers that live in states with CVS/pharmacy stores, you can ask us to pass your order--including your contact, health, and billing information--along so you can pick up your prescription up at a store location near you.
Rest assured, your information will be shared only if you choose to "pick-up" your new prescription or use our time-saving Express Refills service.
==========
Updating Your Information
People move, switch jobs, or experience health changes.
You can update any of the information you've given us anytime by visiting Your Account.

==========
In order to provide you with content and services that match your interests, CVS/pharmacy and CVS.com have Co-Brand and Sponsor relationships with many of the best services and content companies available.
You can recognize most of these areas by the joint branding of CVS/pharmacy and CVS.com with such companies.
For example, if you see a logo in the banner area of the page that says "____at," "With ______," "Featuring______," or "From our Partner _____," you are in a Co-Branded or Sponsored area.
CVS.com also provides links to sites of community organizations that CVS/pharmacy and CVS.com sponsor.
These will be clearly identified as links that take you to external Web sites.
Other third-party relationships are "Private Label" relationships where a partner provides CVS/pharmacy and CVS.com with technology, services, and/or content under CVS/pharmacy and CVS.com branding.
==========
Some of the services we offer through Co-Brand and Sponsor partnerships require registration to make them function properly.
Whenever you register to use Co-Branded, Sponsored, or Private Label areas, the information you provide may be shared with the partners.
We will always tell you up front how such registration information will be used by us and our partners before you give it.
==========
Our partners may also use cookies when you select their promotion, service, or content link.
We are unable to control their use of Cookies or how they manage the information they gather.
We encourage you to look for and review the privacy policies of any CVS/pharmacy or CVS.com partner whose service or content you choose to use.
