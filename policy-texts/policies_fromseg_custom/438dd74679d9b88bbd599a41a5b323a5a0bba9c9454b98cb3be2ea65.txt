Free Accounts: LiveJournal.com accounts are available 
                      for free to all valid registrants.
Free accounts offer a 
                      limited number of features in relation to the other 
                      accounts offered.
Early Adopter: No longer open to new users, this 
                      account was created and made available to users registered 
                      before September 14, 2000.
Early Adopters are offered 
                      extended features over free account users, but do not 
                      receive any new pay features.
Paid Accounts: Paid accounts are available for an 
                      annual fee and offer users all extended and basic features

                      till the journal is deleted, whether by LiveJournal.com or 
                      the user.

                      are generally bestowed upon the LiveJournal.com founders, 
                      administrators, or those that have earned a Permanent 
                      Account by virtue of "Work Excellence" for 
                      LiveJournal.com.

                    malicious intent to find security vulnerabilities.
JOURNAL CONTENTGuidelines for posting to your 
                    online journal shall be as follows:

All Content posted to LiveJournal.com in any way, is 
                      the responsibility and property of the author.
LiveJournal 
                      is committed to keeping the Service in decent standing for 
                      all audiences but is not responsible for the monitoring or 
                      filtering of any journal Content.
Within the confines of 
                      international and local law, LiveJournal.com will not 
                      place a limit on the type, or appropriateness of user 
                      content within journals.
Those users posting material not 
                      suitable for all audiences must agree that they are fully 
                      responsible for all the content they have posted anywhere 
                      on the service.
==========
Should content be deemed illegal by such 
                      law having jurisdiction over the user, LiveJournal.com is 
                      committed to submitting all necessary information to the 
                      proper authorities; 
                      Should any Content be reported to LiveJournal.com as 
                      being offensive or inappropriate, LiveJournal.com might 
                      call upon the author to retract, modify, or protect (by 
                      means of private and friends only settings) the Content in 
                      question within a reasonable amount of time, as set forth 
                      by the LiveJournal.com staff.
Should the author fail to 
                      meet such a request from LiveJournal.com staff, 
                      LiveJournal.com has the full authority to terminate any 
                      such reported and verified offensive account holding such 
                      inappropriate content.
LiveJournal.com, however, is under 
                      no obligation to restrict or monitor journal Content in 
                      any way; 
                      LiveJournal.com claims no ownership or control over 
                      any Content posted by its users.
The author retains all 
                      patent, trademark, and copyright to all Content posted 
                      within available fields, and is responsible for protecting 
                      those rights, but is not entitled to the help of the 
                      LiveJournal.com staff in protecting such Content; 
                      LiveJournal.com reserves the right, without limitation 
                      except by law, to serve user Content on the web according 
                      to the security provisions set forth by the author.
==========
LiveJournal.com also reserves the right, without 
                      limitation, to resell any portion of a user’s LiveJournal 
                      back to that individual; 
                      You acknowledge that LiveJournal.com does not 
                      pre-screen Content, but that LiveJournal.com and its 
                      designates shall have the right (but not the obligation) 
                      on their sole discretion to refuse or remove any Content 
                      that is available through the Service.
Without limiting 
                      the foregoing, LiveJournal.com and its designates shall 
                      have the right to remove any content that violates the TOS 
                      or is otherwise objectionable.
You agree that you must 
                      evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of 
                      any content, including any reliance on the accuracy, 
                      completeness, or usefulness of such content.
Furthermore, 
                      LiveJournal.com reserves the right to limit access to your 
                      journal, if found in violation of the TOS, by removing the 
                      journal and related user information from the member 
                      directory, search engine, and all other methods used in 
                      conjunction with finding LiveJournal’s and users.

                    information, data, text, software, music, sound, 
                    photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials, 
                    whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the

VOLUNTEERS AND LIVEJOURNAL.COMLiveJournal.com 
                    is a volunteer-run project whose primary intent is to 
                    provide high quality, community driven on-line services.
To 
                    achieve this goal, LiveJournal.com volunteers are often 
                    called upon to perform a variety of technical and 
                    non-technical tasks, including, but not limited to, 
                    programming, the creation of web-based content (HTML, BML, 
                    and other formats), graphic design, audio and/or visual 
                    content creation, technical writing, managing electronic 
                    data libraries and/or databases, technical support, 
                    reviewing, categorizing, legal assistance, archiving and/or 
                    forwarding electronic data, providing expert advice, 
                    administration, management, accounting, research, content 
                    creation, promotions, or other assignments, as needed.
==========
All 
                    volunteers are expected to be of legal age, or volunteering 
                    with the consent of a legal parent or guardian.
By accepting these Terms of Service, any LiveJournal.com 
                    member agrees that the intellectual content created as a 
                    result of volunteer work for LiveJournal.com constitutes a 
                    work for hire and that all intellectual property rights in 
                    said content shall vest in LiveJournal.com at the time that 
                    it is created to the extent permitted by law.
If laws 
                    prevent such vesting, the volunteer makes assignment of all 
                    such rights to LiveJournal.com at the time of creation.
If laws prevent such assignment, the volunteer grants a 
                    perpetual world wide non-revocable license to 
                    LiveJournal.com to use said content.
If laws prevent such 
                    licensing, the volunteer agrees never to sue LiveJournal.com 
                    for the use of said content.
==========
The volunteer certifies that any electronic data he/she 
                    submits is his/her work and that to the best of the 
                    volunteer’s knowledge, the electronic data is not claimed by 
                    another.
LiveJournal.com will provide sufficient tools, 
                    training and direction to the volunteer as necessary to 
                    accomplish mutual goals.
The volunteer agrees to insure that 
                    any work provided is correct, error free and does not 
                    contain any inflammatory language, indecency or obscenities.
Furthermore, if said work is found to be illegally 
                    presented, claimed, or forged, LiveJournal.com will remove 
                    such material and, at LiveJournal.com’s discretion, seek 
                    action against the individual(s) from which the work 
                    originated.
No LiveJournal user is required to become a volunteer to 
                    this service, and users without volunteer status are 
                    guaranteed reasonable support and attention as compared to 
                    those users that are volunteers.
