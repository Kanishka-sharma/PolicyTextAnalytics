Location, Governing Law, Arbitration, and Time Period Limitation for Bringing Claim
These Terms are governed by, and must be construed in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, as applicable, without giving effect to their principles of conflicts of law.
By using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories or jurisdictions.
With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Services or these Terms (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), The Root and you agree to negotiate in good faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution.
If you and The Root do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section.
==========
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
Neither you nor The Root will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
==========
No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
The Root and you agree that all disputes arising under these Terms that cannot be settled through informal negotiation will be settled exclusively through confidential binding arbitration in Virginia.
The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.
You agree that The Root may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Virginia, necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under these Terms must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding.
The one-year period begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed.
If a claim or dispute isn't filed within one year, it is permanently barred.

10.
==========
Your California Privacy Rights
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, The Root currently does not take action in response to these signals.
If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.
11.
