Any risk that Beta Features may harm or 
          interrupt the regular running your software or hardware is borne entirely by Users.
API Services.

Moz may provide a free API with its proprietary data.
All data associated with such an API 
          is proprietary to Moz.
If you publicly display proprietary data associated with a free API, you must comply with any link 
          and attribution guidelines set forth on the Site from time to time.

          shall not be entitled to any remuneration or compensation of any kind.
==========
IX.
Service Credits

          Moz may from time to time offer opportunities to earn credits toward the Service ("Service Credits").
For example, Moz may offer Moz Analytics Service Credits to a User or Subscriber if that User or Subscriber refers a 
          customer who purchases a Moz Analytics Subscription and remains in good standing.
These Service Credits are awarded at the discretion of Moz and may be revoked at any time, for any reason, at Moz's sole 
          discretion.
In no event shall credits ever be redeemable for cash, exchanged or sold, or rolled into a separate account
          Unused credits may expire at the discretion of Moz.
If, by way of example, Moz issues Service Credits for a referred account that is later deemed not to be an actual person or 
          company, or the referred account is otherwise not in good standing, was fraudulently attained, or later sought a refund for 
          any payments made, such Service Credits may be revoked and voided and other actions (such as terminating your subscription 
          or banning you from any future referral program) may be undertaken at the reasonable discretion of Moz.

To the extent permitted by law, Moz disclaims any implied warranties including those of merchantability, fitness for a

XIV.
==========
LIABILITY LIMITATION; EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR USERS

          You acknowledge that Moz cannot provide the Service at a reasonable price without limiting its liability as set forth herein, 
          so, as an express condition of use of the Site or Service, you agree to limit Moz's potential liability to you as described 
          in this clause.
This limitation of liability is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between Moz and you as a User.
Moz does not: (i) guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information on the Site or Service, or (ii) adopt, 
          endorse or accept responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made by any party that 
          appears on the Site.
Under no circumstances will Moz or its affiliates be responsible for any loss or damage resulting 
          from your reliance on information or other content posted on the Site or transmitted to or by any Users.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, Moz shall not be liable for any consequential, special, or incidental damages 
          or lost profits resulting from your access to or use of the Site or Service, whether based on breach of contract, breach 
          of warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory.
This includes your inability to access or use 
          (including due to modification, suspension, blocking, discontinuance, cancellation, or termination of the Service or any 
          part thereof) the Site or Service.
Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically acknowledge that Moz is not liable for 
          the defamatory, offensive, infringing, breaching, fraudulent, or illegal conduct of other Users or third parties and that 
          the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with you.
These limitations apply to any matter related to the Site, 
          Service or its content; third party Internet sites, programs or conduct; viruses or other disabling features; incompatibility 
          between the Service and other services, software, or hardware; and any delay or failure in initiating, conducting, or 
          completing any transmission or transaction in connection with the Service in an accurate or timely manner.
These limitations 
          also apply even if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses, or fails its essential purpose; or even if Moz 
          knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states, provinces and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, 
          so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to Users in these jurisdictions.
==========
XV.
Special Admonitions for International Use

          conduct on the Internet and acceptable content.
Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding obscene 
          and indecent content and communications and those regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the 
          United States or the country in which you reside.

          original provision; the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
Any party’s failure to act with respect 
          to a breach of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver or effect that party’s rights to act subsequently.
