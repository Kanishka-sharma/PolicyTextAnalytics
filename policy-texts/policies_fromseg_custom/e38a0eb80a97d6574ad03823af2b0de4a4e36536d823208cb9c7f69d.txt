Social Network and Platform Integration, and Third Party Links
The Websites may contain integration with social networks and other platforms.

If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information via the Websites to a third-party website or other online service, that information may be publicly displayed and the third-party website may have access to information about you and your use of our Websites.
In addition, the Websites may have links to third party websites.

We are not responsible for the privacy or business practices of any third party.
Information Third Parties Provide About You

==========
In addition, we may receive information if you opt-in to receive information from us when on a third party website, app or service.
We may combine the information we receive from these other sources with information we collect through the Websites.

How and When We Disclose Information to Third Parties
Lotame may share information, such as Usage Data, personal data that has been de-identified (typically using a hash function) or pseunodymised and aggregated user statistics, with third parties in our discretion.
We do not share personal data with third parties for those third parties’ own marketing purposes unless we first provide you with the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of such sharing.
==========
We may share the information we have collected about you with third parties as disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, as described in this Privacy Policy, and under the following circumstances:

with our vendors and third-party service providers to perform certain services on behalf of the Websites, such as hosting the Websites or Websites’ features, sending email or other communications, and providing marketing assistance and data analysis;
to comply with legal process or a subpoena, or at the request of a governmental entity conducting an investigation, and to protect and defend the legal rights or property of Lotame, our Websites or its users, or any other party; and
in connection with a business transition (such as a merger, acquisition by another company, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of assets), including during the course of any due diligence process .
In addition, if you apply for a job through the Websites, Lotame may ask you to provide self-identifying information (such as veteran status, gender and ethnicity) in conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies.
Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide such information, Lotame or its service provider may submit that information to the appropriate government or regulatory agencies to fulfill reporting requirements and use that information to defend against employment-related complaints.
Third-Party Analytics Providers, Ad Servers, and Similar Third Parties
In addition to Lotame performing its own analytics and targeting content and advertisements on our Websites and elsewhere online, we may work with third-party network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers, and other vendors to provide us with such information and services.
These service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you.
Some of these parties may collect personal information over time when you visit the Websites or other online websites and services.
We may share Usage Data or de-identified data about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for analytics and advertising purposes.

California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights
Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Lotame does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice.
As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Lotame provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Lotame offers that choice, Lotame does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request by email to privacy@lotame.com write to us at: 8850 Stanford Blvd., Suite 4000, Columbia, MD 21045 Attn: Legal.
