Parrable is a technology company.
We offer a technology platform that enables advertisers, publishers and their technology partners (our “Clients”) to maintain state on computers and mobile devices.
In other words, we help our Clients identify when they are seeing the same computers and mobile devices over time to customize content and advertising, and perform analytics.
This privacy policy covers our website located at www.parrable.com (the “Website”) as well as our proprietary technology platform (the “Platform”).
==========
Parrable is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), which is a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards.
Parrable complies with the 2018 NAI Code of Conduct and the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).
==========
Information Collected via the Platform
The Platform is designed to help advertisers, publishers and their technology partners (our “Clients”) maintain state on computers and mobile devices.
The Platform assigns a unique pseudonymous identifier associated with an Internet browser (our “Browser ID”) whenever our technology encounters a internet browser on a computer or mobile device (“device”).
We store this Browser ID in an encrypted cookie (our “EID”) in the browser being used on a device.
==========
The Browser ID does not help us identify you individually.
It helps us identify your browser so that when our systems encounter that browser again, our Clients will be able to customize advertising and content to your interests and to better understand the effectiveness of their digital advertising campaigns.
In addition to creating the Browser ID, our Platform collects nonpersonally identifiable information, including IP address, mobile advertising identifier (e.g., IDFA or AAID), the time/date a computer or device was seen, and the domain name of the website on which the Browser ID was placed or seen.
Our systems may enable the linking of multiple Browser IDs and the linking of Browser IDs with mobile advertising identifiers when we are able to reasonably infer that multiple IDs are likely to belong to the same device.
Our Platform also assigns a second unique pseudonymous identifier associated with a device (our “Device ID”) whenever our technology encounters the device.
The Device ID is stored along with the Browser ID in the EID.
==========
The EID is encrypted and re-encrypted every time our systems are able to see your device (e.g., when you visit a website where our technology is enabled) to help ensure that no one has access to our identifiers without approval from Parrable.
Parrable does not transfer data about your computer or device except the Browser ID, the Device ID, the mobile advertising identifier and one or more opt-out flags for users that have expressed an optout choice.
If you’d like to exercise your opt-out choice, you may do so through the information provided below.
Our platform uses HTTP cookies to store the EID.
