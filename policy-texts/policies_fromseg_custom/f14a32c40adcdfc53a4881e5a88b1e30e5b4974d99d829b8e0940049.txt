What are cookies?
==========
Cookies are small text files which our Websites and Apps may put on your computer or mobile device when you visit our Websites or use our Apps.
Cookies are widely used by websites and applications to help remember small amounts of information and give you a better experience using the website or application.
For example, a cookie will help a website or application to recognise your device the next time you visit so you don’t have to log on again.
==========
Certain cookies contain a limited amount of personal information.
For example, if you click “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username.
Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information to help us analyse how well our Website and Apps are performing overall so we can try and improve them.
How we use cookies 
BMJ uses cookies on its Website and Apps to perform different functions.
These are grouped into four main categories:

Technically necessary cookies.
==========
Some essential functions of our Websites and Apps are only possible if information is stored persistently between each page you look at.
For instance, if you log in to a site to access subscriber only content, we use a cookie to remember that you are logged in, so you do not have to enter your details on each page you visit.
==========
Customisation and personalisation cookies.
In order to allow us to customise our content for you, we need to remember who you are and what you want.
==========
We use cookies to record your preferences regarding Website appearance, what content you’ve already read, and to present the information that is most relevant to you.
Performance monitoring cookies.
We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our Websites and Applications and to monitor performance.

==========
Third party cookies.

For example, we integrate with social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook, to make it easier for you to share what you have read.
These sites place their own cookies on your browser as a result of us including their icons and ‘like’ or ‘share’ buttons on our sites.
