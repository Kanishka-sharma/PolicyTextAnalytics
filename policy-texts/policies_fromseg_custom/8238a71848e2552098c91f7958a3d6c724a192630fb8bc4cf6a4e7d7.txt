Our owner, The Scott Trust, exists to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian.
Other than to cover expense, The Scott Trust takes no dividend from the business, ensuring all profits are reinvested back into the Guardian and its award-winning journalism.
One of the ways in which we safeguard our journalism for the future is by using your personal data.
==========
Increasingly, our readers fund us directly â€“ either by buying a newspaper, or taking out a print or digital subscription or through making one-off, regular or monthly contributions.
But to grow that number of supporters we are reliant on marketing, and we still rely in part on advertising to fund our journalism.
We think carefully about our use of personal data and we have a privacy policy and a cookie policy which explains how we collect, use, share and transfer your personal data, as well as a place where you can manage your emails and marketing preferences when signed into your Guardian account, and a team who are dedicated to keeping any data we collect safe and secure.
