Adobe Digital Marketing Suite, featuring Omniture® technology, and its Subsidiaries are a leading provider of on-demand, online business optimization services, delivering essential data insights to improve the performance of online business and marketing initiatives.
We have created this privacy statement (the "Product Privacy Statement") to demonstrate our commitment to our customers, the privacy of their website visitors, and the right of privacy throughout the Internet.
Privacy is of great importance to us.
==========
Because we gather, collect and analyze important information on behalf of our corporate customers on portions of their websites and/or other online and offline sources, we have established this privacy statement (“Product Privacy Statement”) as a means to communicate our information collection and dissemination use practices as a provider of on-demand, online business optimization services.
Please note that further information regarding our practices with regards to our website at www.omniture.com can be found at:
Customer Data
We and/or our Subsidiaries act as an agent (and data processor in the EU context) to each of our corporate customers for the purpose of providing Internet data hosting and optimization products and services.
Our corporate customers may use information that has been collected by us on their website(s) and may also provide us with additional information collected by the customer or their trusted partners to create web sites, and applications that are easier to use and are more appealing to their visitors.
The information we collect or receive from our customers may include (but is not limited by) general website traffic patterns, most popular web pages visited, referring domains, referring search engines, search queries, campaign success rates, visitor attrition rates, and types of product(s) purchased.
==========
Our customers may also either request that we collect or provide to us personally identifiable information that has been obtained by the customer, such as (but not limited by) email addresses of visitors to their website(s).
In situations where we either collect or receive personally identifiable information on behalf of our customers, we ask our customers to provide notice within their privacy policies about their data collection and use practices.
All such information is and will remain customer property.
==========
As such, and subject to the remainder of this paragraph, Adobe will not disclose information to any third party, unless permitted, instructed or directed to do so by the customer, or unless it is transferred among our Subsidiaries solely for the purposes of processing such instructions or directions.
Adobe will not review, share, disclose, distribute, print, or reference any such information except as permitted, requested or directed by the customer or as may be required by law.
Individual customer records may at times be viewed or accessed by Adobe for the purpose of resolving a problem, addressing a support issue, fulfilling a billing requirement, or as may be required by law.
Our corporate customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the usernames and passwords they use to to log into Adobe accounts.
We may store and process personally identifiable information in the United States or any other country in which we or any of our Subsidiaries maintain facilities.

Cookies and Clear GIFs
What Are Cookies 
	 	Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet visitor's browser that are designed to store basic information (such as visitor preferences).
Most of our corporate customers use cookies on their websites in connection with our products and services.
These cookies use anonymous IDs to help our corporate customers better estimate the number of unique visitors to their website(s) as well as what types of web pages or services visitors use on their websites.
There are two types of cookies that may be used: session and persistent.
Session cookies exist only during a website visitor's online session.
They disappear (expire) from the visitor's browser when he/she closes the Internet browser.
Persistent cookies remain on the visitor's brower even after the browser has been closed.
When examining your cookies you may notice a cookie that is set by one of the following domains - 2o7.
net or omtrdc.net.
The 2o7.
==========
net and omtrdc.net domains are the domains Adobe uses to set cookies on our customers’ behalfs to to collect visitor information behavior on their website(s).
Both domains are owned by Adobe and are set on our customers’ behalf.
==========
Controlling the Use of Cookies
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies set by and on behalf of our customers if you prefer.
For further information about disabling cookies you can visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
==========
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of certain web sites and services that depend on cookies.
What Are Clear GIFs?
Clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help our customers understand how visitors interact with their websites.
A clear GIF is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page.
The use of a clear GIF allows the website owner to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear GIF.
Most of our customers use clear GIFs on their websites in connection with our products and services.
Controlling the Use of Clear GIFs
   Because clear GIFs are included within the content for a web page (just the same as any other content request), you cannot opt out or refuse them.
However, where they are used in conjunction with cookies they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or by changing the cookie settings in your browser.
In other instances, such as in the case of emails, clear GIFs are typically not used in conjunction with cookies and if you are unhappy with the use of clear GIFs in such manner, we suggest you consider what privacy options the company who sent you the email provides.
Customer Policies
			   We strongly recommend that our customers, who act as the data controller (in the EU context), add statements or clauses to their privacy policies specifically describing their use of third party hosted optimization products and services (such as those provided by Adobe) and describing the details of such third party products and services (such as the use of cookies and clear gifs/web beacons).
==========
Further, we strongly recommend that each of our customers provide their visitors with information regarding the ability to opt-out of having their browsing behavior used for data aggregation and analysis purposes(see opt out section below).
It is very important that you review the respective privacy policy of each customer website that you visit, because such privacy policies govern the use of information collected on those websites, including our customer's use of Adobe’s products and services.
