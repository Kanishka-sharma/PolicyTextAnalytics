Collection and Use of Information
By using Valve's online sites and products, users agree that Valve may share with other parties aggregate information and individual information but not personally identifiable information gathered by Valve in the course of the continuing use of Valve online sites and products.
"Aggregate information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user.
"Individual information" is information about a user that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users but not in a form that personally identifies any user or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such communication.
This information may be used to improve Valve's products and online sites, for internal marketing studies, or simply to collect demographic information about Valve's users.
Valve may use customer contact information provided by users to send information about Valve, including news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, but only if the users agree to receive such communications.
Except in the cases described below, Valve will not share personally identifiable information with any third party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in advance.
"Personally identifiable information" consists of a user's name, email address, physical address, or other data about the user that enables the recipient to personally identify the user.
While Valve collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis, for certain products and online sites, Valve's collection of personally identifiable information may be a requirement for access to the product or site.
Personally identifiable information will be processed and stored by Valve in databases situated in the United States.
Valve may allow third parties performing services under contract with Valve to access stored information but such access shall only be to the extent necessary to provide those services.
In those instances, the third party will be bound by the terms of this privacy policy.

This information is searchable and available to other users within the Friends functionality of Steam.
==========
Personally identifiable information collected from users may be done in conjunction with associates under agreement with Valve.
If an associate of Valve is collecting your personally identifiable information within one of our products or online sites, Valve will make users aware of this at the time the information is gathered.

If a user does not want to provide this information, the user may choose to opt out of providing this information.
Additionally, if providing the information is a requirement of usage, the user may decline to use that particular service or product.

When possible, Valve will make a reasonable effort to direct users to the privacy polices of these associates.
Valve's privacy policy does not extend to associates of Valve.
