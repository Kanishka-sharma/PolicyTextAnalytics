Privacy Policy
Merriam-Webster is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to its Web sites.
The guidelines below explain how 
  we protect the privacy of visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine and its features.
Personally Identifiable Information
Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine by limiting the collection of personally 
    identifiable information.
==========
For certain promotions and to access certain features, such as to receive a Word of the Day 
  subscription, we may request a voluntary submission of information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age.
Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 
    13, except as permitted by law.
If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this 
    policy, we will delete that information immediately.
If you believe Merriam-Webster has any information from or about anyone 
    under 13, please e-mail us at privacy@m-w.com.
==========
All personally identifiable information collected through Merriam-Webster OnLine is used by Merriam-Webster and its staff 
    to process and manage subscriptions, track site usage patterns and statistics, or to deliver services through the site; such 
    information may also be used by the company for market research or for prize or information-request fulfillment unless otherwise 
    indicated.
Such information will not be posted or published by us, and, except as specified below in this privacy policy regarding 
    anonymous aggregated data, or to provide services to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster OnLine, it will not be provided to 
  third-party providers without consent.
==========
If you choose to provide personally identifiable information to us, you may receive the following types of e-mails from us:

E-mails related to subscription-maintenance activities.
Periodic e-mail newsletters highlighting new features, content, and usage tips for Merriam-Webster OnLine.
Periodic special offers for additional Merriam-Webster and Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and services.
Periodic special offers from Merriam-Webster approved partners if you "opt-in" or give us your permission to send them.
When you provide personally identifiable information to us, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive special 
    Merriam-Webster or partner offers.
Each offer will also have information available to allow you to "opt out" if you wish to 
  receive no further offers.
==========
Merriam-Webster OnLine may also use other third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described 
    above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to personally identifiable information for the 
  sole purpose of providing these services, such as Word of the Day,to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster OnLine.
Merriam-Webster may also disclose personally identifiable information in special legal circumstances.
For instance, such 
    information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires 
  us to do so.
Anonymous Information
Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical or market research 
    purposes.
==========
For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's visitors are adults between the ages 
    of 25 and 35.

We use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of Merriam-Webster OnLine and to gather non-personal information about visitors 
    to the site.
Cookies are small files that Merriam-Webster transfers to the hard drives of visitors for record-keeping purposes.
These 
    monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or 
    Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they 
    use.
This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services 
    requested by our customers.

    to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one Merriam-Webster OnLine page to another and to improve site performance.

    the information we gather in this way can be used to identify any individual who visits the site.

    messages that you may see on various Web pages,to conduct research about such advertisements, promotions, and other marketing messages, and 
    to analyze visits to this and other Web sites.
==========
To do this, such third-party providers may collect anonymous data through the use of 
    cookies, beacons, and by other means.
Merriam-Webster does not permit any of these companies to collect personally identifiable information 
    about visitors to Merriam-Webster OnLine using cookies or beacons or any other means.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information 
    that such third parties may have collected from visitors or the method used by such third parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies 
    and beacons).
