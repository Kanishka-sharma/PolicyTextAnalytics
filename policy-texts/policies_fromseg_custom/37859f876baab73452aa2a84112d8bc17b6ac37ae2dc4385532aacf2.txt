When a company uses Adobe's advertising services, that company tells us what type of information to collect for them.
Examples of the type of information these companies may ask Adobe to collect are:
•  Where you go and what you do on that company's website, apps, or social media
•  Your browsing activity, including the URL of the web page you are visiting
•  The URL of the page that showed the link you clicked on that brought you to that company's website
•  The search you performed that led you to that company's website
•  Information about your browser and device, such as device type, operating system, connection speed, and display settings
•  Your IP address, which Adobe may use to approximate your general location
•  Information you may provide on that company's website or when interacting with that company within social media, including information on order and registration forms and information tied to your profile on social media accounts
•  Details relating to the types of products and services you have bought from that company
•  Ad campaign success rates, such as whether you clicked on a company's ad and whether viewing or clicking on the ad led you to purchase that company's products
The information Adobe's advertising services collect belongs to the company using our services, not to Adobe.
Adobe uses this information only as allowed in a contract with the company to provide services to that company.
Note that sometimes Adobe has permission from these companies to access and share "aggregated" information collected by Adobe with our customers, prospective customers, and partners in order to improve our products and services, to provide reports and market research, and to understand market trends.
==========
Aggregated information is anonymous and does not identify individuals.
For example, we may publish reports that show which browsers or operating systems are used to access websites of the companies that use our advertising services.
Most Adobe advertising services, such as the services that help companies provide ads on news articles, are not designed to collect information that identifies you personally.
However, if you either provide a company information that identfies you or interact with a company's social media sites, apps or pages, Adobe may use that information to provide you ads for that company through social media.
Adobe does not use any of this information for its other advertising services.
Some companies may also buy or acquire from public sources additional non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your age and gender, and then add that additional information to the information collected by Adobe's advertising services.
Companies will often do this so they can provide you with more relevant advertising.
For information on how a company uses this information, refer to that company's privacy policy.
