	     This privacy statement describes privacy practices which are specific to https://contribute.surveymonkey.com
	     ("SMC") and should be read in conjunction with our main Privacy Policy.
SurveyMonkey Contribute is used by people who are interested in taking surveys on SMC ("Panelists") and people who conduct the surveys taken by
	     Panelists ("Panel Buyers").
This privacy statement describes how SurveyMonkey collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide.
It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
We refer to surveys conducted through SMC as "Contribute surveys," and
	     these are treated differently to surveys conducted through SurveyMonkey's main website.
SMC is a service
	     provided by SurveyMonkey Inc. and its affiliates.

When SurveyMonkey receives personal information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on
	     SurveyMonkey's behalf, SurveyMonkey has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent
	     with the Privacy Shield and (ii) SurveyMonkey is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred
	     pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, SurveyMonkey is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
In certain
	     situations, SurveyMonkey may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security
	     or law enforcement requirements.

This page is split into two sections: one for Panelists, and one for Panel Buyers.
PRIVACY FOR PANELISTS
What information does SurveyMonkey collect from Panelists?
Below is a list of information that we collect from you and
	     about you when you use SMC.
The sections afterward
	     describe what we do with this information.
Information we receive directly from you


Registration information: You are required to have a SurveyMonkey account to use SMC as a Panelist.
To register for a SurveyMonkey account, we need to collect account information from you (your username, password, and email address).
==========
Profile data: To allow Panel Buyers to target Panelists with specific characteristics when conducting Contribute surveys, we build profiles of Panelists.
We build up your profile by asking you to answer questions about yourself, and from your responses to Contribute surveys that Panel Buyers conduct.
We refer to all of this information as "profile data."
When compiling profile data, we may collect your demographic information (e.g. year of birth, gender, employment status, the industry in which you work, ethnicity, religion, income level, education level, country of residence, zip code, political views, home ownership status, marital status, number of children, etc.), interests (e.g. what activities you participate in and how often you participate), preferences (e.g. what sort of food or drinks you like) and opinions.
Contribute survey responses: We receive your survey responses that you submit to Panel Buyers.
Information we receive about you from other sources


Usage data: We receive usage data about you whenever you interact with SMC.
This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, and which Contribute surveys you complete.
==========
Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.
The log files may include Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.
Device data: We receive data from the device you use to access SMC, such as your IP address and your browser type.
We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
==========
Provision of information is voluntary: You can always choose not to provide any personal information that we ask you for.
However, your ability to use SMC may be limited if you do not give information that we require to provide you with our services.
For example, if you do not provide profile data, you may be unable to participate in surveys or your chances of being chosen for a survey may be reduced.
About sensitive information: We will treat sensitive information (for example, personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or affiliations, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information related to one's sexual preferences) with particular care.
You may be asked to provide sensitive information as part of your profile data.
If we intend to disclose such information to a third party or use it for a purpose other than as described in this privacy statement, we will obtain your specific permission to do so prior to any such use or disclosure.
How does SurveyMonkey use your information?
==========
Generally, we use your information in connection with providing SMC services to you and to Panel Buyers.
More specifically, we use it:
	   


To provide you with relevant surveys: We use your profile data to target Contribute surveys to you and send you emails inviting you to take those surveys.
For example, if the profile data you provide shows you are a 30 year old female living in New York, we may send you a survey where a Panel Buyer is interested in the opinions of any person living in New York aged between 25-35 years.
To improve SMC: We internally use the data we receive to improve the quality of our service.
For example, we use and analyze usage data (such as page view data and response rates) to make the surveys we send more relevant to you, to improve the SMC user interface and to maintain a consistent and reliable user experience.
We use profile data to help us to improve the quality of our panel.
==========
To provide Panel Buyers with more targeting criteria: We may use the responses you give to Contribute surveys to provide other Panel Buyers with more ways to reach the target demographic they want.
However, we do not give your actual survey responses to Panel Buyers other than the buyer actually conducting the survey.
For example, if you disclose in a Contribute survey that your stock portfolio has 21 stocks, we might allow Panel Buyers to target Panelists based on their stock portfolio size.
If a Panel Buyer wanted to target people with stock portfolios with more than 10 stocks and you responded to the survey, the Panel Buyer would know that you have more than 10 stocks in your portfolio.
But, we would not share with them the more specific information that you have 21 stocks.
To verify compliance: We may inspect your Contribute survey responses to ensure your compliance with the SMC Terms of Use.
==========
We do not sell your profile data!
While we do provide some of your profile data to Panel Buyers, we do not sell it.
Not to anyone.
==========
Not marketing firms, not researchers, no one.
Who we disclose your information to and what information we share

	     We recognize that because you give us and allow us to use your profile data and other personal information, we are entrusted with safeguarding the privacy of that information.
Your continuing trust is very important to us, so the only time we will disclose or share that information with a third party is where we have:
	   

	     (a)	given you notice (e.g. in this privacy statement);
	     
	     (b)	obtained your consent (e.g. based on your account's opt-in/opt-out settings); or
	     
	     (c)	anonymized the information, so that you cannot reasonably be identified by it.
==========
We disclose your:
	   


Survey responses to Panel Buyers:  We host Contribute surveys for Panel Buyers, but they are really the primary curator of survey data.
Anything you expressly disclose in your Contribute surveys will, naturally, be provided to them.
Panel Buyers may have their own privacy policies which apply to surveys that they create using our services.
These policies detail how Panel Buyers handle your information and if one is provided, we encourage you to read it.
Basic demographics to Panel Buyers:  When you respond to a survey, we automatically provide the Panel Buyer with a specific set of information about you that we compile from your profile data for the Panel Buyer.
We refer to this set of information as "basic demographics".
==========
It includes your:
	       
Year of birth
Gender
Employment status (e.g. full-time employed, full-time student, retired, etc.)
Industry in which you work
Ethnicity
Income
Level of education
Country of residence
Zip code
Languages
Political views (e.g. liberal or conservative)
Religion
Home ownership status
Marital status
Number of children living in your household



	       The sharing of your basic demographics happens behind the scenes and is not visible on the survey.
We do not include your name or contact details as part of the basic demographics.
Other demographics to Panel Buyers (indirectly):  Although we do not disclose more than basic demographics to Panel Buyers, because they target their Contribute surveys to specific demographics, they will be able to infer that you belong to this demographic simply because they will only receive responses from that demographic.
When selecting the characteristics of desired survey respondents, a Panel Buyer may also receive an indication of how many Panelists match the Panel Buyer's particular demographic requirements for a given survey.
Anonymized Panelist statistics for informational purposes: We may disclose aggregated, or otherwise anonymized, statistics about our Panelists.
For example, we may post on our blog or include in our marketing emails interesting statistics like what the average response rate for Contribute surveys is, or what percentage of Panelists are male.
==========
Your information to Service providers.
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service.
These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Your information if there’s a change in business ownership or structure.
==========
We may transfer your information, including all profile data, account details, other personal information, and responses to surveys, to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which SurveyMonkey participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of SurveyMonkey’s assets related to SMC.
In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.
We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
Disclosures required by law: We may disclose your information as required or permitted by law, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or other legal process served on us.
Are your Contribute survey responses anonymous?
==========
To Panel Buyers, the answer is maybe.
Of course, if you disclose your name in a Contribute survey, you won't be anonymous.
But even if you don't, the personal information you do provide may become identifying when combined with other information.
Remember that Panel Buyers are also supplied with your basic demographics.
To help preserve your anonymity, we require a Panel Buyer's targeting criteria to match a certain minimum number of Panelists before we allow the Contribute survey to be conducted.
To SurveyMonkey, the answer is no.
==========
We link your responses back to your username but never fear, we do not abuse or exploit this.
We do this to provide Panel Buyers with additional targeting criteria (see "How does SurveyMonkey use your information?"
above).
We do not disclose this link to the Panel Buyer.
==========
Your choices and controls
	   


You can always refuse to answer a survey: Your participation in any Contribute survey is entirely voluntary and you may opt out of responding at any time.
You can update your information: If you want to change your profile data, contact support@surveymonkey.com and we will be happy to help.
As a Panelist, you may access and correct certain personal information that SurveyMonkey holds about you by visiting your My Account page from the SMC website.
Some panelists and other individuals (including those whose information we receive under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor) have certain legal rights to obtain information of whether we hold personal information about them, to access personal information we hold about them, and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances.
For some information, these rights may be exercised through the My Account page mentioned above, and in all cases, requests to exercise these rights may be directed to our customer support team.
These rights are subject to some exceptions, such as where giving you access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals.
We will respond to your request to exercise these rights within a reasonable time and, where required by law or where we deem it otherwise appropriate and practicable to do so, we will honor your request.
Information related to data collected by Panel Buyers: If you are a Panelist that has chosen to provide your contact information to one of our Panel Buyers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Panel Buyers that use our service or who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information, please contact the Panel Buyer (the data controller) that you interact with directly.
Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Panel Buyers.
==========
You can leave SMC and have your SMC information deleted: If you no longer wish to use SMC, you can request to leave by contacting support@surveymonkey.com.
We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe by removing SMC from your SurveyMonkey account and permanently deleting your profile data.
You will stop receiving invitations to take Contribute surveys.
Any personal information submitted in the past to Contribute surveys will not be deleted - you will need to contact the Panel Buyers who created those surveys to access that data.
Note that leaving SMC will not delete your main SurveyMonkey account.
Data retention: We may retain your information (including the information we process on behalf of our Panel Buyers) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
==========
Security
	   

	     The security of your personal information is important to us.
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at support@surveymonkey.com.

Generally, we use your information in connection with providing SMC services to you and to Panelists.
More specifically, we use it:

For example, if you ask "How high can you jump?"
we may give other Panel Buyers the ability to target Panelists who can jump more than, say, 2 feet high (based on the responses your survey respondents gave).

We don't use your survey responses for any other purpose.
We do not sell your survey data!
Not to anyone.
==========
Not marketing firms, not researchers, no one.
Who we disclose your information to and what information we share
	   

	     While you allow us to use your survey data and other information in accordance with this privacy statement, you always own all of your survey data and we regard it as information which is confidential to you.

Survey responses to no one: Except for a narrow set of reasons set out in the main SurveyMonkey Privacy Policy (e.g. if we are compelled by law).
Anonymized Contribute survey information for informational purposes: We may disclose aggregated, or otherwise anonymized, information about Contribute surveys.

	       When you register for an account, we will use your name and email address to send periodic emails to you of both promotional and transactional in nature.
