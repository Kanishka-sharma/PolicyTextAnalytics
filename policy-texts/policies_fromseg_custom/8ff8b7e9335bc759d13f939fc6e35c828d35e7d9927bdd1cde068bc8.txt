 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
and its related companies ("Britannica") recognize the importance
                of protecting the privacy of Personal Information collected about
                its Users.
"Personal Information" includes, but is not limited
                to, usage data, along with the name, address, telephone number,
                e-mail address, and credit card and salary information of Britannica
                Users.
Therefore, Britannica does not sell or otherwise permit third parties to use
                any individually identifiable Personal Information about any User
                without an express and informed consent of such User.
Nor does
                Britannica include in Britannica.com or EB.com any
                functionality for performing "reverse searches" to identify Britannica
                Users from their e-mail addresses.
==========
However, Britannica reserves
                the right to analyze and utilize Personal Information in order to more effectively
                optimize the User experience and to present certain opportunities
                to Users for their benefit.
Britannica also reserves the right
                to share with its partners and third parties some Personal Information
                provided that such use of Personal
                Information does not violate any expectations of privacy of or
                agreement with any Britannica User.
Britannica has adopted this
                Privacy Policy to inform Britannica Users how it does collect,
                store, and use Personal Information.
Britannica's intent is to
                balance its legitimate business interests in collecting and using
                Personal Information against the reasonable expectations of privacy
                of its Users.
Our Commitment to Privacy.
==========
Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. ("Britannica") is committed to respecting
                the privacy of visitors to its family of Web sites (collectively,
                the "Britannica sites" and each, a "Britannica site") and parties
                related to them.
Except as otherwise provided, this Privacy Policy
                applies to all of the Britannica sites, which include, but are
                not limited to, Britannica.com and EB.com.
To better
                protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online
                information practices and the choices you can make about the way
                your information is collected and used at this Britannica site.
The Britannica sites are general audience
                Web sites, intended for Users of all ages.
==========
Personal information
                of all Users may be collected, used, and disclosed as described
                in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy contains a section
                with specific details regarding personal information collected
                from children.
See "Protection for Children" below.
==========
The Information
                We Collect.
To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality services,
                we collect and apply information from our interactions with visitors
                and subscribers (each a "User") to the Britannica sites, as well
                as from other parties.
Because we respect your privacy, we have
                procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled
                in a safe, secure, and responsible manner.
The information we
                receive and collect depends on what a User does when visiting
                one of the Britannica sites.
Your Personal Information.
Britannica recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy
                  of personal information collected about its Users and other
                  third parties.
In general, our Users are able to visit many
                  of our Web pages without telling us who they are or revealing
                  any information about themselves.
As discussed under "Usage
                  Data" below, we may track the Internet domain or "Internet
                  protocol" addresses from which Users visit us and analyze this
                  data in the aggregate to determine usage for trends and statistics.
Individual Users will remain anonymous, unless they voluntarily
                  tell us who they are.
==========
There may be times, however, such as when subscribing to
                    our services or making purchases from the Britannica Store,
                    when we ask Users to provide certain Personal Information
                    about themselves.
"Personal Information" may include, but
                    is not limited to, the name, address, telephone number, e-mail
                    address, and credit card information of Britannica site Users.
Whether or not a User provides such information is completely
                    his or her own choice.
If a User chooses not to provide the
                    Personal Information we request, he or she may be unable to
                    access certain services and content on our Britannica sites
                    or purchase products from us.
==========
Demographic Information.
There will also be opportunities for subscribers to provide
                  us with demographic or profile information regarding their preferences
                  and interests.
This information may include, but is not limited
                  to, age, gender, household income, level of education completed,
                  number of children in the household, and personal-interest information.
This demographic information, however, is not required and is
                  completely optional on a subscriber's part.
==========
Prospect and Referral Information.
If a User visits Britannica.com and submits an e-mail address to
		  Britannica but fails to complete the registration process, we may use
		  such "prospect" information to contact the prospective User from time to time
		  with Britannica offers and information about new features, new services, and
                  special discounts we think they may see as valuable.
Similarly,
                  if a User forwards a Britannica e-mail to a friend,
                  we may use the "referral" information provided to contact the
                  friend from time to time with Britannica offers and information
                  about new features, new services, and special discounts we think
                  the friend may see as valuable.
==========
All of our "prospect" and "referral"
                  communications contain clearly marked opt-out instructions.
The types of personally identifiable information that may be
                  collected in relation to "prospects" or "referrals" include:
                  name and e-mail addresses.
We do not sell or rent any contact
                  information for such "prospects" or "referrals."
==========
Cookies.
To help you personalize your online experience, Britannica uses
                  "Cookies."
"Cookies" are pieces of information that Britannica
                  transfers to the hard drives of Users for record-keeping purposes.
One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a convenience
                  feature to save you time.
==========
For example, Cookies allow us to recognize
                  you when you re-enter a Britannica site so that you will not
                  have to log in each time you visit.
Cookies also allow us to
                  count the number of unique and return visitors who use the Britannica
                  sites.
In addition, Britannica places Cookies with Users visiting
                  from advertising banners and hyperlinks on other Web sites to
                  track the success of a particular advertising campaign or marketing
                  program.
==========
Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies.
If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when
                  you've received a Cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept
                  Cookies.
It is important to note that you may not be able to
                  use certain features on a Britannica site if you choose not
                  to accept Cookies.
The use of Cookies is an industry standard
                  and occurs at most major Web sites.
Beacons.
==========
We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and
                  optimize our Internet business and communications.
We use the services
                  of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our
                  advertising and how visitors use our site.
To do this, we use Web
                  beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site.
==========
The type of information we collect includes pages visited, search terms,
                  referrers, campaigns, anonymous user identifier, and anonymous account
                  identifier.
By supplementing our records,
                  this information helps us learn things like what pages are most
                  attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our
                  customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.
Although
                  our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our
                  behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
If you do not
                  want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and
                  marketing strategy, you can “opt-out” of this website analysis tool
                  by clicking here.
==========
How We Use the
                Information We Collect.
Personal Information

Britannica uses Personal Information for: allowing Britannica
                  site Users to obtain an account and to receive communications
                  they request; making ongoing enhancements to the Britannica
                  sites; marketing and promotional purposes (for example, offering
                  Users the opportunity to take advantage of special promotions
                  for Britannica products and services (See "Subscriber Communications"
                  and "Offers from Our Business Partners" below)); and
                  evaluating Web site usage by analyzing and otherwise using Personal
                  Information and related data in the aggregate, but not with
                  respect to any individual Britannica site User.
In addition,
                  with respect to Britannica site Users located outside North
                  America, we may share pertinent Personal Information with our
                  local subsidiaries.
Please click on the following links to review
                  privacy policies of our local subsidiaries:

                    Privacy Policy
Australian
                    Privacy Policy
Britannica does not sell or otherwise permit third parties to use any individually
                    identifiable Personal Information about any Britannica site
                    User without an express and informed consent of such User.
==========
Nor does Britannica include in any of the Britannica sites
                    any functionality for performing "reverse searches" to identify
                    Web site Users from their e-mail addresses.
However, as discussed
                    below, Britannica reserves the right to analyze and utilize
                    Personal Information in order to more effectively
                    optimize the User experience and to present certain opportunities
                    to Users for their benefit.
Britannica also reserves the right
                    to share with its partners and third parties some Personal
                    Information provided that such
                    use of Personal Information does not violate any expectations
                    of privacy of or agreement with any Britannica site User.
Britannica has adopted this Privacy Policy to inform Britannica
                    site Users of how it collects, stores, and uses Personal Information.
Britannica's intent is to balance its legitimate business
                    interests in collecting and using Personal Information in
                    order to continuously improve Britannica products and services
                    against the reasonable expectations of privacy of its Users.
==========
Demographic Information.
In an ongoing effort to improve its services, Britannica may
                  use aggregated demographic information to draw conclusions about
                  Users' wishes and preferences.
Britannica may also provide demographic
                  information in the aggregate regarding Britannica site Users
                  to third parties in connection with Britannica advertising campaigns
                  and marketing programs; however, no demographic information
                  relating to any individual Britannica site User is disclosed
                  without the express consent of such User.
In addition, any such
                  User may withdraw his/her consent at any time by following the
                  instructions provided under the heading "How to Opt Out,
                  Correct, Update, or Remove Personal Information" below.
As stated above, submitting such demographic information is
                  not required and is completely optional on a subscriber's part.
==========
Prospect and Referral Information.
As discussed above, we may use prospect and referral information
                  to contact a prospect or referral from time to time with Britannica
                  offers and information about new features, new services, or
                  special discounts we think such prospect or referral may see
                  as valuable.
We do not sell or rent any contact information
                  for such prospects or referrals.
==========
Usage Data.
We only use Usage Data in the aggregate -- that is, we look
                  at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than
                  on an individual basis.
This data helps us determine the extent
                  to which our visitors use certain parts of a Britannica site,
                  which, in turn, enables us to make the Britannica sites as appealing
                  as possible.
We may also provide statistical "ratings" about
                  how our visitors collectively use our Web sites to advertisers
                  and other companies with which we do business ("Business Partners").
We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use
                  their areas of the Web sites in order for them to provide you
                  with the best possible experience.
These statistical ratings
                  do not contain any personally identifiable information about
                  any of our individual Users.
==========
Disclosure
                Exceptions.
We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so
                by law; for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement
                agency's request.
==========
Subscriber
                Communications.
As a benefit of membership, Britannica site subscribers may receive
                the following communications from us:

Communications related to subscription
                  maintenance activities.
These communications may include,
                  without limitation, notices regarding material changes to Britannica
                  site policies, service updates, service enhancements, and account
                  management procedures.
Since these communications are necessary
                  to ensure Britannica provides its subscribers with the highest
                  quality of services, our subscribers are not permitted to opt
                  out from receipt of these communications.
Newsletter Communications.
As a benefit
                  of a Britannica subscription, we may send our Britannica subscribers
                  our exclusive Britannica Newsletters.
These newsletters
                  are full of useful Britannica content.
==========
To unsubscribe to a newsletter,
                  a User can either (i) follow the instructions at the bottom
                  of any newsletter or (ii) follow the instructions set forth
                  below in "How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove Personal
                  Information."

                  about Britannica products and services.
We may send promotional
                  e-mails and other outbound communications to Britannica site
                  subscribers regarding products and services from Britannica.
Any Britannica site subscriber that does not wish to receive
                  such product and service communications can choose to remove
                  his or her contact information from our contact list at any
                  time by (i) following the instructions at the bottom of any
                  promotional e-mail or (ii) following the instructions set forth
                  below in "How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove Personal
                  Information."
==========
Offers From
                Our Business Partners.
Britannica also offers its Users the
                opportunity to receive money-saving offers, discounts, and promotions
                from our Business Partners.
These communications may come from
                Britannica or directly from the Business Partners themselves.
This program is conducted strictly on an opt-in basis.
==========
In order
                to receive or decline the offers, you must follow the clearly
                marked instructions on the relevant page.
If you leave the box
                unchecked, you will not receive any offers.
If you do sign up
                for the program, but later change your mind, you are free at any
                time to opt out by (i) following the clearly marked instructions
                at the bottom of any such communication or (ii) following the
                instructions set forth below in "How to Opt Out, Correct, Update,
                or Remove Personal Information."
==========
Protection
                for Children.
Children should always ask parents for
                permission before providing any Personal Information to Britannica
                or purchasing any products or services from Britannica.
Britannica
                expressly adheres to all laws and policies related to children's
                privacy.
Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personally
                identifying information from or about children under 13, except
                as permitted by law.
If we discover we have received any information
                from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete
                that information immediately.
If you believe Britannica has any
                information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us in
                the manner provided for below.
==========
Our Commitment
                to Security.
Britannica only collects information from Britannica site Users
                to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve its legitimate
                business purposes, and it uses state-of-the-art security technology
                to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of all collected
                information.
In addition, Britannica uses security measures in
                connection with the collection and transmission of Britannica
                site User information during each Britannica site's registration
                process.
Nonetheless, Britannica is not responsible for any breach
                of its security or for the actions of any third parties that may
                obtain any Britannica site User information, including Personal
                Information or demographic information.

Third-Party
                Advertising.
The Britannica sites use the services of third parties to present
                or target the advertisements, promotions, and other marketing
