WHAT IS A COOKIE?
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device
    when you visit a website.
Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another
    website that recognizes that cookie.
A
    pixel tag (also called a
    web beacon or
    clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email)
    that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as
    counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites, assessing what content or
    ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors.
Some ad companies and game developers use “
    flash cookies” for ads and games that use Flash media technology.
We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.
Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to
    the owners of the site.
==========
We use these technologies to let you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences,
    track your use of the Services and generally improve your experience.
Ad companies we work with place cookies on your
    computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display ads on our Sites and third party websites
    that are more relevant to you and your interests.
There are two broad categories of cookies:


First party cookies,served directly by us to your computer or mobile device.
Third party cookies,which are served by a third party on our behalf.
We use third party cookies for functionality,
        performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes.
==========
Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time.
Some cookies are 'session cookies', meaning
    that they exist only while your browser is open.
These are deleted automatically once you close your browser.
Other cookies
    are 'permanent cookies', meaning that they survive after your browser is closed.
==========
They can be used by websites to recognize
    your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.
