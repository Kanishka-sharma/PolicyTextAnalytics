EFFECTIVE DATE: JULY 15, 2016
This privacy policy outlines what information we collect, how we secure it, and how we use it in relation to the service Acuity Ads provides to its customers.
WHO WE ARE
Acuity Ads has developed a proprietary technology platform that enables marketers and agencies to effectively target consumers with digital advertising.
Most of the internet is offered to users free of charge.
Web publishers are able to offer valuable content for free because they are supported by advertising.
Acuity aims to create a better browsing experience for web users by allowing advertisers to present relevant advertising content, rather than advertising that is unrelated to users’ interests.
Advertisers also benefit because targeted advertising is more effective and better received.
We take your privacy seriously.
We are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adhere to its Code of Conduct, as well as the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada’s (DAAC) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
We continuously improve our privacy safeguards in order to help protect information about your browsing activities.
==========
OUR TECHNOLOGY
We obtain information using one of the following techniques, which are all widely used across the Internet:
COOKIES
A cookie is a small data file stored on your device containing a symbol that is assigned to your browser the first time it is seen by our service.
On subsequent interactions with our service, we use this symbol to, among other things, know what advertisements you have interacted with previously.
Cookies cannot be used to install malware, viruses or any other harmful software and they cannot access any personal or confidential data on your computer.
PIXELS (ALSO KNOWN AS WEB BEACONS)
Pixels are tiny images embedded in a web page that allow us to know that you’ve seen the page.
They also allow us to create, update and read our own cookies.
==========
ADVERTISING IDS
An Advertising ID (device identification) is a distinctive number associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device.
Advertising IDs are accessible by Publishers and can be passed to Acuity with an ad request.
These Advertising IDs do not enable Acuity to identify individuals, but rather can be used for certain advertising purposes.
It can be used to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same device, track a device to show that the device interacted with an ad (i.e. “clicked” on it, watched a video ad, or downloaded an application as a result of an advertisement).
Acuity may also partner with third parties that have their own methods of identifying a device.
These can be used as described above, or in some cases can be used for the purposes of supporting 3rd party targeted advertising solutions.
Where these solutions are employed, Acuity will work with our Exchanges or otherwise endeavour to provide end-users with the ability to opt-out of these solutions.
==========
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Using the technologies described above, we collect information that does not identify you personally (“Non-PII”) but allows us to serve users more relevant ads and to understand how users interact with ads.
This information is collected when you visit the website or mobile application (“app”) of entities for which we serve advertisements, or the websites or apps where we display advertisements.
For example, we collect information about your browser type, information about your operating system, device, and the unique identifier assigned to your device.
In addition, we collect information about your web browsing and app usage, such as the date and time you visited one of our partner’s websites or apps, pages of such websites or apps that you visit, the names or types of mobile app that you visit, and other data such as page visits, ads shown, ads clicked and conversions (“Log Data”).
THE INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT
Our data collection process is transparent so that you can make informed decisions about how your information is used.
==========
We do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number, or social security number.
The data we collect is primarily used to understand your online activity and consequentially provide you with relevant advertisements based on non- personal identifiers.
The information we collect is used to deliver personalized advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of the ads.
Using this data we can infer such things as:

Browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer)
Operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows)

Internet Protocol (IP) address
Internet Service Provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon)

OPTING OUT
Why you should not opt out:
There are many benefits to receiving interest based advertisements.
==========
Our algorithm reads your online data and aims to deliver you the most relevant advertising content available.
This results in you only seeing ads that match your consumer profile.
Without interest based advertising marketers do not know your consumer preferences and will likely deliver you ads that you are uninterested in.
It is also important to consider that the websites you use receive substantial payments from marketers to present interest based ads.
These increased revenues can improve website content and pass on a reciprocal benefit to you, as the user.
Without this revenue websites are more likely to deliver lesser value content.
==========
Opt Out:
If you prefer not to receive interest-based advertising from Acuity, you can opt out by clicking here, by visiting the NAI website here, by going to the DAA website here or the DAAC website here.
If you do opt out, Acuity will set a cookie on your browser that tells Acuity not to tailor ads to your interests.Opting out does not mean you will not be served an ad by Acuity, but the ads we serve will be less relevant to your interests.
Please note that the opt-out cookie only applies to the computer and browser where it is set.
Also, if you delete the opt-out cookie (such as by clearing all cookies on your browser), you will need to renew your opt out choice.
