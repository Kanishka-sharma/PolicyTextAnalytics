Where Is My Data Stored?
We (and many of our external third parties) are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal information will involve a transfer of data outside of the EEA.

by transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;
by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same protection it has if it was in the EEA;
where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar levels of protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US as if It was in the EEA.
To keep this privacy policy as short and easy to understand as possible, we have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used.
