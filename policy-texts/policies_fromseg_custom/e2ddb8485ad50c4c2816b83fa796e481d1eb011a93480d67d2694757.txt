Collecting and Using Your Information
This Online Privacy Statement covers the collection and use of personal information on the kodak.com Web site and most Kodak online services.
The information covered by this statement is information an individual provides to Kodak during an online transaction outside of the individual's trade, business or profession.
Kodak also is committed to keeping secure the confidential business information it receives from its commercial customers.
For more information, see statements available where commercial information is requested.
==========
Personal Information
Kodak collects personal information online when:
you register to become a member of kodak.com or another Kodak service
you use our services to store, share, and/or print your pictures online
you make online purchases
you submit questions or comments to us
you request information or materials
you request warranty or post-warranty service and support for a Kodak product
you register products online
you participate in online surveys
you participate in online promotions, premiums, sweepstakes or contests
The type of information collected may include name, address, billing and delivery information, e-mail address, gift recipient information, and credit card information.
Kodak uses the personal information you provide to register you in programs; create and maintain accounts; process, fulfill, and follow up on orders; answer your e-mail; send information you request; and register products.
We also use this personal information to provide you with information related to your account and the products or services you purchased from us, to better understand your needs and interests, to improve our service and to personalize communications.
If you own a Smart Picture Frame, Kodak recognizes your Frame's unique frame identification number ("Frame ID") to identify your Frame whenever it connects to the StoryBox Network.
Kodak associates this Frame ID with your StoryBox Account to verify your account status, deliver your content channels, upload pictures from and download pictures to your Frame, process orders for prints, and provide better customer service.
==========
E-mail
Kodak may send you e-mail about your orders or your account and in response to your questions.
Kodak and our subsidiaries may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you, unless you indicate you do not want to receive them.
We will give you an opportunity to let us know your preference regarding the receiving of promotional e-mail when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal information, or when we send you e-mail.
If you choose not to accept this promotional e-mail, you may not receive special offers that may be of value to you.
==========
This option applies to promotional e-mail only, as we may find it necessary to send you e-mail relating to your account or order.
All promotional e-mail that you receive from Kodak will tell you how to decline receiving future promotional e-mail.
You may change your e-mail preferences at any time.
==========
See "Keeping Your Information Accurate" below.
Personal Information about Others
If you send us information about others, we will use that information (usually an e-mail address) to do what you asked us to do (for example, to send an album or to enable a print order).
We may also send them information and/or special offers about products and services, but they can easily decline receiving any further communications from us.
==========
Sharing Your Personal Information
Kodak will not sell, rent, or trade the personal information you provide online.
We do share your personal information with certain Kodak business affiliates.
Kodak may disclose personal information to third parties without your consent as required by law or court order, to cooperate with Government authorities in a criminal investigation, and to enforce or protect Kodak's property or contractual rights.
==========
Kodak reserves the right to transfer your personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets.
If the business is sold or transferred, Kodak will give you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your personal information.
In some cases, this may mean that the new organization will not be able to continue providing to you the services or products that Kodak provided.
==========
Other Information - Cookies
Kodak automatically receives and records data on our servers from visitor browsers including computer IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and other information through the use of cookies.
This information is collected about thousands of site visits and analyzed as a whole.
This analysis looks for trends among many visitors to kodak.com or other Kodak sites, and determines which parts of the site are accessed most frequently and what information visitors find most valuable.

==========
We may use this type of information and combine it with your personal information to help customize our future interactions with you.
In doing so, we hope to provide better service to you by tailoring our communications to match your interests - to give you more of what you want and less of what you don't want.

==========
Protecting Your Information
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place certain physical, electronic, managerial and security procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
We safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures, such as using Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and we continually assess new technology for protecting information.
Kodak employees are trained to understand and comply with these information principles and we communicate our privacy policy, practices and guidelines to all employees.
However, while we strive to protect your personal information, you must also take steps to protect your information.
We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal information while you are on the Internet.
At a minimum, we encourage you to change your passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure that you are using a secure browser as you surf the Internet.

Kodak cannot control the comments that you may receive while you participate in these services.

Children's Privacy
Protecting the online privacy of children is especially important, and those under the age of 13 are protected by federal law.
For that reason, Kodak does not knowingly permit children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites, or to buy goods and services on our sites, without verifiable parental consent.
Kodak does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13, except with their parent's express consent.
If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended site audience, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice; and we will provide processes to obtain parental approval, provide access to information and allow parents to request removal of their children's personal information.
==========
Kodak encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to participate in their interactive activities and interests.
