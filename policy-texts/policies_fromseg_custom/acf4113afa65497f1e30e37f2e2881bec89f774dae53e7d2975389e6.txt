Personal Data We Process


	Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or
	identifiable natural person (“Personal Data”).
When you visit and use our websites, products and services, we may collect
	data or ask you to provide certain data, including Personal Data, for the
	purposes of helping us manage our relationship with you or to perform our
	products or services for you.
“Personal Data” includes following types of
	information:



			Data collected directly from you or your device relating to an
			identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”), and may
			include direct identifiers such as name, address, email address,
			phone number, and online or indirect identifiers such as login
			account number, login password, marketing preferences, social media
			account, payment card number, or IP address;
	

			If we link other data with your Personal Data, we will treat that
			linked data as Personal Data; and
	

			We may also collect Personal Data from trusted third-party sources
			such as distributors, resellers, app stores, contact centers, and
			engage third-parties such as marketing, survey, analytics or
			software suppliers to collect Personal Data to assist us.
We organize the Personal Data we process into these basic categories:
	Billing Data, Account Data, and Product Data.
Billing Data includes your name, email address, credit card number, and in
	certain circumstances, your billing address and your phone number.
In most
	circumstances, our products and services are purchased from a trusted
	third-party service provider, reseller, or app store.
In those
	circumstances, your Billing Data is processed by the relevant third party
	and we only receive a subset of this data to keep proper business records.
Account Data includes your name, address, email address, phone number,
	photo, date of birth, gender, and interests and this data is used to
	register an account with Avast.
Product Data includes two sub-categories:


	If you want more detail about the Personal Data we process on a product
	basis, please refer to the relevant product and service privacy notices
	accessible below.
Why We Process Your Personal Data


	We use your Personal Data for the following purposes and on the following
	grounds:


On the basis of fulfilling our contract with you or entering into a
	contract with you on your request, in order to:



			Process purchase of our products or services from us, our partners
			or our trusted third- party service providers’ online stores;
	

			Provision the download, activation, and performance of the product

			products.
We will always ask for your consent before any processing that requires it.
You can withdraw your consent anytime by contacting us, using the
	‘Unsubscribe’ link or using the product settings or other choices.
Upon the
	consent withdrawal, we will stop the processing.
The withdrawal of consent,
	however, does not affect the processing already carried out before the
	withdrawal.
On the basis of legal obligations, we process your Personal Data when it is
	necessary for compliance with a legal tax, accounting, anti-money
	laundering, legal order, or other obligation to which we are subject.
On the basis of our legitimate interest we will use your Personal Data for:



			In-product messaging and cross-selling; we will communicate
			commercial promotions for products and services provided by us;
	

			Product development, research and to implement product features and
			improvements, as well as product updates;
	

			Third-party analytics to evaluate and improve the performance and
			quality of our products, services and websites and to understand
			usage trends;
	

			Allow interoperability within our applications;
	

			Secure our systems and applications;
	

			Allow effective performance of our business by ensuring necessary
			internal administrative and commercial processes (e.g. finances,
			controlling, business intelligence, legal & compliance,
			information security etc.); and
	

			Establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights.
We have balanced the interests for the above mentioned processing
	operations.
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to our
	particular situation, to those processing operations.
==========
For more details
	please see section Your Privacy Rights.
It Is Your Choice


	You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us by adjusting
	the privacy settings of the relevant product.
The choices for paid versions
	are:



			Cross-product direct marketing: – when we offer you another product
			from a company within our group;
	

			Cross-product development – when we collect data from one product
			and use it for the development of another product;
	

			Third-party Ads – when we offer any third-party products.
Please note, if you purchased a product from us and in your product
	settings, you do not see one or more of these choices, it means your
	Personal Data is not being used for this purpose.
Within all product versions – paid and free – it is possible to turn off
	processing for third-party analytics purposes, such as purchase
	optimization, crash reporting, and trend analytics.
==========
Processing of IP Addresses


	For paid products including antivirus, virtual private network, and
	performance, your IP address is collected at the time at which your product
	or service is being provided, for the purpose of facilitating our billing
	process.
Specifically, our third-party billing partner will collect your IP
	address for its billing process; we do not store the IP address from this
	process.
For free and paid products including antivirus, your IP address is also
	processed for the purpose of downloading certain products and malware
	detection.
Please refer to our supplementary product and service privacy notices at
	the end of this Privacy Policy for specific use of IP address by our
	products and services.
==========
Network Security


	We process Personal Data for network and information security purposes.
In
	line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized
	legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the
	extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring
	network and information security.
This primarily covers the ability of a
	network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful
	or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity,
	integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the
	security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those
	networks and systems.
Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of
	cybersecurity technologies and services which may include hosted and
	managed cybersecurity technology services, it is necessary for the
	functionality of our systems, products and services and in our legitimate
	interests as well as in our users’, to collect and process Personal Data to
	the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of
	ensuring the security of our own, and of our users’ networks, devices, and
	information systems.
This includes the development of threat intelligence
	resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis the
	ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and
	other harmful events (“cyber-threats”).
The Personal Data we process for said purposes includes, without
	limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:



Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of			SPAM);
	

			Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email
cyberattacks including			phishing);
	

			Reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals
			sending malicious email);
	

			Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise
			harmful executable files attached to emails);
	

			URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or
			hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents); and/or
	

			IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved
			in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or
			other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise
			harmful contents).
==========
Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain
	Personal Data concerning you or any other Data Subjects.
However, in such
	cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly
	necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking,
	reporting (by removing any personally identifiable elements) and mitigating
	the cyber-threats of concern to you, and to secure your network, device and
	systems.
When processing Personal Data in this context, we do not seek to
	identify a Data Subject.
Marketing and Community Networking


	We have a legitimate interest in promoting our commercial offerings and to
	optimize the delivery of communications to that effect to our users that
	are most likely to find them relevant.
We will therefore collect and
	process data to that end as explained below.
==========
However, where we are legally
	required to obtain your consent to provide you with certain marketing
	materials, we will only provide you with such marketing materials where we
	have obtained such consent from you.
If you do not want to continue
	receiving any marketing materials from us, you can click on the unsubscribe
	function in the communication or e-mail at any time.
In-product and Email Messages


	We have a legitimate interest to use Personal Data to provide notices (we
	call this in-product messaging) of our latest product announcements,
	software updates, and product and service performance.
If you have a paid
	version and you do not want to see these notices, you can shut it off in
	the product settings.
If you have supplied us your email address, we will
	also provide notices through this channel in the form of newsletters, blog
	notification or refer-to-a-friend function.
Please note, if you don’t want
	to be on our marketing mailing list, you may unsubscribe anytime by using
	an unsubscribe link we provide you in every marketing communication we send
	you.
==========
Personalized Ads


	We have a legitimate interest to support free versions of our products,
	including our mobile versions, such as mobile antivirus, by serving
	relevant third-party ads.
Your Personal Data is used by our advertising
	partners to serve the third-party ads.
If you do not want to see
	third-party ads, you may, at any time, change to the paid version of the
	product, which does not serve third-party ads.
These advertisements are delivered to you by our advertising partners, who
	process your Personal Data in order to deliver interest-based advertising.
The only information we get in this particular scenario is the minimum
	information necessary in order to manage our relationship with the
	advertising partners and through that, track our revenue and manage our
	finances.
This information is relevant to a specific advertising partner
	(although the report does not list the specific ad that was clicked on).
Across all of our free mobile products and services, the following
	advertising partners may be present:


	How We Process Your Personal Data


	We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the
	Personal Data that we use:



			For free versions of the antivirus, this disconnection or removal
			of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially
			activated.
==========
For paid users of the antivirus, we keep Billing Data in
			a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than
			handling payments and our own finances.
For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for,
			minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the
			normal performance of the products and services.
Please note, consistent with the above, our processing of your Personal
	Data in most cases does not require identification:



			With the paid versions, while the products and services are active
			and for a necessary retention period after that, we will maintain a
			copy of your direct identification in order to handle payments,
			respond to support queries, for anti-fraud purposes, and to
			maintain proper records of transactions.
For the paid versions, we are technically able to connect the
			provision of products and services with the Billing Data.
==========
For the
			free versions, when no registration or additional collection of
			information concerning a user’s identity is required, for example,
			with the free antivirus, we provide the products and services
			without any direct identification of the user.
For the free versions, we shall not maintain, acquire or process additional
	information solely in order to identify the users of our free products and
	services.
This is simply not necessary for the free versions of our
	products to be provided to you and function.
This means, when you use a
	free version of our products and services and you contact us with a request
	concerning your Personal Data, e.g. for a copy or deletion of your Personal
	Data, please understand we are not in a position to identify you in
	connection with your specific free products and services and thus we will
	not be able to satisfy some of your requests.
Of course, where we are not
	able to satisfy some of your requests because of this, we will always
	inform you of this fact.
How We Disclose Your Personal Data


	We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within the Avast
	group, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our
	behalf and with public authorities, as required by applicable law.
==========
Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy
	Policy and the relevant product and service sections.
If we disclose your
	Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy
	and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.
Distributors, Resellers


	We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of
	distribution, sale or management of our products.
Our partners may use your
	Personal Data to communicate with you and others about Avast products or
	services.
In addition, you purchase our products directly from our
	distributor, a reseller, or an app store.
Because your relationship in
	these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third
	party will also process your Personal Data.
==========
Service Providers


	We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data
	for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant product
	and service sections accessible below.
We contractually require service
	providers to keep data secure and confidential.
Such service providers may include in particular contact centers,
	professional consultants (including to defend or exercise our rights), and
	marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers.
Sometimes these service providers, for example, our distributors,
	resellers, and app store partners, will be independent controllers of your
	data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”)
	and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.
==========
Advertising Companies


	To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve
	third-party ads of advertising companies in our products for mobile
	devices.
To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”)
	provided by an advertising company into the product, which then collects
	Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you.
For further information,
	including the exact scope of processed Personal Data, please refer to each
	company’s privacy policy set in the table above.
Trend Analytics


	We have partnered with our subsidiary, Jumpshot Inc., to use information
	about where our products and services are used, including approximate
	location, zip code, area code, time zone, together with the URL and
	information related to the URL of sites you visit online.
We collectively
	call this information “Clickstream Data”.
Jumpshot uses this Clickstream Data to build products and services that
	provide trend analytics for companies.
All direct identifiers are removed
	from Clickstream Data and, as a result, all that Jumpshot gets is an
	aggregated, de-identified data set of online trends.
Public Authorities


	In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal
	Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law.
No
	Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response
	to:



			A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued
			request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such
			data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers,
			executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing
			to honor such legal process;
	

			Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce its legal
			rights pursuant to applicable law; or
	

			A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or
			preventing credit card fraud.
==========
Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings


	Like any other company, we too go through its own cycle of growth,
	expansion, streamlining and optimization.
Its business decisions and market
	developments therefore affect its structure.
As a result of such
	transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may
	transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate.
If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our
	assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction.
We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event,
	when applicable.
Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to
	Third-Party Vendors


	We are a global business that provides its products and services all around
	the world.
==========
In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with
	our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe.
The
	servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a
	country different than the one where you live.
In some instances, these may
	be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
Regardless, we
	provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it
	processes.
==========
At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, we
	always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such
	as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission or
	specialized regimes such as Privacy shield, which legally bind the
	receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that
	your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are
	protected.
Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include
	provision of our products and services, processing of transactions and your
	payment details, and the provision of support services.
Further, an
	outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a
	restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA [insert
	link to the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section].

Analytics and Crash Reporting


	We use analytical tools, including third-party analytical tools, which
	allow us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security
	issues with our products, improve their stability and function, understand
	how you use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve
	your user experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns.
While
	we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to
	partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their
	own tools and expertise.
Below, we list these partners, their tools which
	we use, as well as additional information on where and how we use them.
==========
How We Protect Your Personal Data


	Safeguards for Protection of Personal Data


	We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the
	protection of your Personal Data.
Administrative Safeguards


	Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel
	who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for
	example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who
	service user accounts.
In the case of third-party contractors who process
	personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed.
These
	third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when
	they leave.
Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that
	individual's credentials are revoked.
==========
Technical Safeguards


	We store your personal information in our database using the protections
described above.
In addition, we utilize up-to-date	firewall protection for an
additional layer of security.
We use high-quality antivirus and	anti-malware software, and
regularly update our	virus definitions.
==========
Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our
	users' data are required to implement privacy and security practices that
	we deem adequate.
Physical Safeguards


	Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an
	encrypted virtual private network (VPN), except for email which requires
	user authentication.
Otherwise, access is limited to our physical premises.
Physical removal of Personal Data from our location is forbidden.
==========
Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to
	provide reasonable physical safeguards.
Proportionality


	We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the
	purpose for which we collect it.
This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk
	of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we
	collect, the smaller the overall risk.
==========
Children’s Privacy


	Our websites, products and services are not intended to be used by nor are
	they directed to children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly
	collect their information.
Exceptions do apply where we provide you with
	products and services designed specifically to assist you as a parent by
	providing child online protection features.
In such cases, we will only
	collect and process Personal Data related to any child under 13 years of
	age, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect
	and process.
Details about this processing is included in the privacy
	notices of these specific products.
Please refer to the specific applicable
	notices for this important additional information.
==========
How Long We Store Your Personal Data


	We will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the longest of the
	following periods:



			For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for
			our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights; and
	

			For other data, only as long as necessary for its purpose.
For the sake of clarity where we are in the position of a data controller
	processing your Personal Data for our own purposes, your Personal Data will
	be deleted or anonymized when it is no longer needed for its originally
	stated processing purposes, or any additional compatible purpose for which
	we may lawfully further process such data.
Moreover, where we are in the position of a data processor processing your
	Personal Data for the purposes and on the instructions of another data
	controller or data processor, we will comply with the time limits agreed
	with that other controller or processor unless we are compelled by
	applicable laws and regulations to delete such data sooner, or to retain it
	further.
Storage of Your Personal Data


	The data we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical
	and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as
	third-party servers in the Czech Republic, in the United States, as well as
	anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate.
The
	current lists of our establishments worldwide and of our service providers
	who process relevant Personal Data on our behalf are available upon
	request.
==========
No Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling


	We do not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling
	that significantly affects you.

Specific Products for your PC


Avast and AVG AntiVirus & Internet security products & services


	Our AntiVirus and Internet security products require the collection of
	usage data to be fully functional.
Some of the usage data we collect
	include:



potential malware			threats to
			your device and the target of those threats, including copies of
			files or emails marked as potential malware, file names,
			cryptographic hash, vendor, size, date stamps, associated registry
			keys, etc.;
	

			information about how you use our products and their features,
			including data about your particular device, installation and
			uninstallation rates, language, technical parameters and
			manufacturer of a device, device security information (password
			attributes, encryption level), etc.;
	

			information about where our products and services are used,
			including approximate location, zip code, area code, time zone, the
			URL and information related to the URL of sites you visit online;
			and
	

			we collectively call this information “Clickstream Data”
	


	We use this Clickstream Data to provide you malware detection and
	protection.
We also use the Clickstream Data for security research into
	threats.
We pseudonymize and anonymize the Clickstream Data and re-use it
	for cross-product direct marketing, cross-product development and third
	party trend analytics.
Avast CommunityIQ


	Avast CommunityIQ is a threat monitoring service.
==========
Information about a
	threat detected in your device is sent to our server, so we can observe how
	the threat spreads and block it.
This is vital for the functioning of our
	service and our ability to keep your device secure.
When you download our products and services, you will automatically be
	opted into our CommunityIQ, and your device is able to provide
	security-related information when needed.
You may choose to opt out via
	product settings.
==========
By remaining in our CommunityIQ, you actively help
	yourself and others in the Avast community to experience a higher standard
	of security.
Our security experts process the data acquired by our CommunityIQ to update
	our databases of viruses and infected websites, and for historical and
	statistical purposes to understand where the threat is coming from, the
	levels of threat per country, how many persons visited the malicious
	website and the number of people we protected.
We process this data for the
	purposes of antivirus functionality and to protect your device.
The data is collected from your entire submission process online.
For both
	desktop and mobile users, this includes URLs of visited websites, IP
	Addresses, approximate geolocation of user or Internet Service Provider
	(ISP), device IDs together with the information on the nature of the
	detected threat.
We collect this information to ascertain the source of the
	infection.
==========
Geolocation gives the approximate location, for example, the latitude and
	longitude of the IP Address.
However, if you access a malicious website
	while using Wi-Fi, then your IP Address can be location data.
Depending on
	your ISP, your IP Address may indicate an exact location or the location of
	the ISP office or your location at a country level.
==========
We may provide a method for manual submission of suspected malware, or a
	way to add more information about the source of an infection.
Files and
	information submitted through this process will be retained as long as is
	necessary for security research and providing you protection.
Avast File Reputation Service


	FileRep is a database of executable files sourced from users who
	participate in the service.
The files (or their hashes, that is,
	de-identified versions of the files) are stored and evaluated for the
	purpose of determining which are infectious and updating virus databases.
Your participation is voluntary, and the data is stored in a way that
	limits its potential to be associated with individual users, for example,
	by hashing so the data is anonymous.
This means it can be personally
	identifiable data if reversed by a “key”.
==========
However, the risks are lowered.
In participating, you actively help yourself and others to experience a
	higher standard of security.
If you do not want to participate, you can opt-out by unticking the box
	‘Enable reputation services’ in the general settings menu.
==========
CyberCapture


	CyberCapture is a feature in our AntiVirus that detects and analyses rare,
	suspicious files.
If you attempt to run such a file, CyberCapture locks the
	file from your PC and sends it to the our Threat Lab where it is analysed
	in a safe, virtual environment.
You are notified when the analysis is
	complete.
Currently, CyberCapture triggers when you run or download suspicious files
	from the Internet that CyberCapture has not previously encountered.
We plan
	to expand this condition in the future to cover more sources.
CyberCapture is able to handle large files, but it may take longer to
	deliver such files to the Threat Lab.
All files are uploaded over an
encrypted connection, which means your data is inaccessible to	hackers.
==========
When CyberCapture is enabled, we collect information about you, your device
IDs, your operating system, for example, whether you are using	Windows 10 or XP,
	and we know your approximate location, usually at the country level.
CyberCapture is enabled by default in the latest version of our AntiVirus.
We strongly recommend that you keep CyberCapture enabled.
If you would like
	to disable CyberCapture, open the
	
		product user interface
	
	and go to Settings.
Avast CleanUp


	CleanUp is offered as a Windows program.
It removes unneeded files,
	registry entries, broken shortcuts and other similar items.
It also
	provides system tuning features like program deactivator.
==========
For it to
	function, we process and store the following:



			originating IP Address; scanned systems history including data
			about operating system, patch level;
	

			system health, hardware information (including CPU), graphics card
			information, hard drive information;
	

			system data information, which is a list of computer software
			installed, directory listing of software, registry name and
			entries, registry hives and executables; and
	

			other operational data, for example, errors and error messages.
We use this data for operational purposes, and to provide you with a fully
	functional service.
Avast Secure Browser


	In the default setting, our Secure Browser will process:



			your IP Address;
	

			the GUID number assigned to your installation of the Browser;
	

			cookies usage data; and
	

			browser extensions.
We use the data we collect to provide the Browser’s functionality, to
	monitor performance and to improve our services.
You can access and manage
	key privacy features from the Secure Browser’s settings:


Browser Security & Privacy Center


	The built in Security & Privacy Center is a curated collection of some
	key security and privacy features, tools and settings, organized into one
	management console making it easier for you to control and manage your
	online privacy and security.
==========
Anti-Phishing


	This blocks malicious websites and downloads to help prevent your personal
computer (PC) from becoming infected with viruses,spyware, and	ransomware.
Privacy Cleaner


	This cleans your browser history, cached images, cookies including both
	first-party and third-party cookies, and other junk with just one click, to
	keep your activity private and free up disk space.
Stealth Mode


	This prevents your browsing history from being stored and removes any
	tracking cookies (both first-party cookies and third-party cookies) or web
	cache you pick up during that browsing session.
==========
Avast Secure Browser will also process the following data locally on your
	PC:



			your browsing history;
	

			personal information and passwords;
	

			a list of permissions;
	

			thumbnail-sized screenshots of websites that you visit;
	

			cookies or data from websites you visit;
	

			data saved by browser extensions and add-ons;
	

			data on what you downloaded from websites;
	

			data imported from other browsers; and
	

			bookmarks.
You can manage the data stored locally on your machine in the Browser
	settings.
Data stored locally on your machine is not collected by our
	servers.
You can manage this information in several ways:



			you can delete your browsing history, cookies and site data by
			visiting the Security & Privacy Center and using the ‘Privacy
			Cleaner’ tool;
	

			you can stop our Secure Browser from accepting cookies from
			publisher websites by ensuring that ‘Anti-Tracking’ is turned on
			from within the Security & Privacy Center;
	

			you can modify the cookie setting policy under the us Secure
			Browser Settings by going to Settings/Advanced settings/Security
			& Personal Privacy/Content settings;

==========
Avast Passwords


	Avast Passwords is a feature that stores user passwords and notes under a
	single master password or fingerprint and permits the user to log on to
	multiple sites using a unitary sign-on credential.
On Windows, our Passwords forms an integral part of the AntiVirus, which
	can be activated by the user by either performing a smart scan or by
	opening the feature in the product menu.
On other platforms (Android, iOS
	and Mac) Passwords is a standalone program.
When activated, Passwords will check whether you have stored any passwords
	via your browser and will suggest you move these passwords to Passwords, so
	they can be stored securely.
When you choose to do so, Passwords will upload these passwords and remove
	them from your browser.
==========
Please note that the browser check happens locally
	on your device and none of your passwords are sent to our servers.
Your passwords and other personal data are stored locally on your devices
	and encrypted by the Passwords app.
However, when you choose to activate the optional feature "Synchronisation
	& Backup" to synchronise and backup your passwords across all your
	devices, you are required to create an account.
Your personal data, that
	is, your passwords and notes, which may include credit card details, will
	be backed up on our remote server in a securely encrypted form, readable
	only via a “master key” on your device.
Thus, it cannot be decrypted by us.
The data collected by our Passwords is necessary to provide the product
	functionality.
==========
Identity Guard/Passwords/HackCheck


	This functionality works in a number of ways.
It allows you to check
	whether the passwords to your online accounts have been compromised.
We are
	able to do this by searching through the database of leaks which we know
	about.
You can do this through a number of our products which have this
	functionality.
==========
Hack Check – Hack Check is our website where you can check your
			leaks simply by entering your email.
You will then be sent the
			results of the check to your email.
Our service will then also send
			you periodical emails as to whether we have learned that your
			credentials have leaked.
You can unsubscribe from receiving these
			messages by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of these
			emails.
Identity Guard – Identity Guard is a function within Avast Mobile
			Security where you can enter an email address and get back feedback
			on whether or not your credentials have leaked.
The functionality
			also stores e-mail addresses with respect to which no leak was
			detected, and will notify you if we learn that your credentials
			leaked at a later date.
Password Guardian – Password Guardian is a function within the
			Passwords product.
When you store your credentials in the Passwords
			product, in an encrypted vault, we will notify you if we learn that
			your credentials have leaked elsewhere.
==========
Antispam


	Antispam is a product functionality that is designed to protect you against
	unwanted emails (spam).
The software may collect information contained in
	emails reported by you as spam or identified as spam by a third-party tool
	(Mailshell).
When you report an email as spam, the email is sent to the
	third party.
==========
Your consent is required for each of these submissions if you
	use the default setting.
We do not collect, use or store your personal data.
We do not share your
	software or device ID or any of our generated IDs with the third party.
In
	general, Mailshell does not have information about individual users or
	devices and is not able to connect any information to you.
If you wish to
	know in detail what data Mailshell collects from you, please go to their
	website.
==========
Avast SafePrice


	When you use SafePrice, information related to certain shops or products,
	URLs, the installation GUID, a timestamp of the offer, purchase, product
	name and number, merchant’s name, product links, prices and the categories
	of your purchased items, location at country level will be collected or
	transferred to us.
This information is used to retrieve available offers, for example, coupons
	or cheaper prices from third parties partnering with us.
We request offers
	anonymously from those third parties and will not transfer or disclose your
	personal data to them.
At this stage, you do not communicate with the third party, only with us,
	and we do not forward any information to the third party except your
	country level geolocation and language.
We do not give them your personal
	identifiers, so no emails and no names.
==========
The third parties may use cookies in relation to the services they provide
	on or via SafePrice.
For example, when you click on an offer presented
	within the product, a cookie may be placed on your computer.
Third
	party/third party's partner/service provider sites, offers and/or cookies
	are not controlled by us and are not subject to this privacy policy.
In the end, you buy directly from the seller.
We do not have access to your
	credit card details as you deal directly with the third-party companies.
==========
Avast BackUp


	The Avast BackUp service is provided by a third party under contract with
	us, and the privacy policy, terms of service, and EULA of the third party
	apply to any information that users provide in connection with the Avast
	BackUp service.
Avast BackUp provides backup and storage capabilities for personal data
	that otherwise would reside only on your computer's hard drive.
For the
	BackUp to work, data on your hard drive must be transferred to a centrally
	hosted site so that it can be "backed up."
If your hard drive contains personal information, that information will be
	transferred to the host site for storage and subsequent retrieval.
Techniques used to protect this information during storage and transmission
	are described below.
==========
Avast Omni


	Avast Omni is a connected device and suite of products aimed at providing
	you comprehensive security in your home and for your entire family.
It has
	the following features:



			Home Network Security - this is the feature aimed at protecting
			your whole home network as well as your individual devices from
threats such as various types of malware,			DDoS attacks or smart
			home hacking.
Upon activation, OMNI will become a hub of your
			device network next to your router, through which all traffic from
			your connected devices will be redirected.
==========
In order for it to work,
			it needs to process
			
				device data
			
and			service data
			about the network and devices connected to it and data concerning
			traffic, including but not limited to: information concerning your
			devices (such as device ID, OS and its version, model and
			manufacturer), the network and connections made (are you connected
			to WiFi or broadband, connection speed, etc.), URLs of the websites
			you visit, as well as certain metadata concerning the files you
			download or some fragments of the underlying network traffic
			(although we will, under no circumstances, access the contents or
			decrypt it); and
	

			Parental Controls, which is a feature that functions in the same
			way as our standalone
			
				“Family Space”
			
			product.
We process this data in order to provide you with the Omni’s functionality,
	in particular, to detect threats to your network and devices.
We further
	use this data in order to understand how users use and interact with our
	product through analytics conducted either by us or by our
	
		analytical tool providers.
==========
In order to use Omni, it is necessary that you create and manage your Omni
	through an
	
		Avast Account
	
	.
All of the above device data and service data will then be linked to your
	Avast Account.

Specific Products for your Mobile


Avast and AVG Products & Services


	In the sections below, we look at what data is collected when you use AMS,
	AVG AntiVirus and AVG Protection for Xperia, in addition to variations of
	these apps developed specifically for tablets or alternative app stores.
When you first run these apps following installation, you have the option
	to subscribe to use the paid version.
If you stay on the free version, we
	will serve third party ads; if you do not want to view third party ads, you
	may choose the paid version.
Whatever your choice, your service data is not
	connected to your Billing Data, because there is no Billing Data for free
	users and for paid customers, as described above, your Billing Data is
	collected only by the app store where you purchased the product.
If you use the free version of our apps, the services are supported by
	third party ads.
Choosing to install the free version means data such as
	your IP Address will be provided to the third party ad server.
In some instances, Avast Mobile Security (AMS) or AVG AntiVirus may come
	preinstalled on your mobile device upon purchasing it from the store and
	you can deactivate them within the product Settings – Personal Privacy.
==========
Web Shields


	Web Shield Lite is on by default and is only effective on some browsers and
	Android operating system versions.
When enabled in a supported
	configuration, the app reads URLs from the browser in realtime and sends
	them to our server via the URL information service.
We check the URL
	against our database of known threats and then display an alert if the URL
	is a known threat.
==========
Web Shield with Accessibility is off by default.
You need to grant
	Accessibility permission to activate this feature.
While it is the same
	service as Web Shield Lite, it is capable of checking URLs in more browsers
	and operating systems.
The list of supported browsers and operating systems
	sometimes changes due to the development of or changes to third party
	services.
==========
We may use anonymous browsing data for third party trend analytics.
All
	users may turn off data sharing in product Settings – Personal Privacy.
Avast AntiTheft for Android


	AntiTheft is a function within AMS.
It is off by default.
==========
When you choose
to turn it on, you can request location on demand from	my.avast.com or through SMS commands
	from another phone.
AntiTheft is designed to protect data residing on your
	mobile phone in the event of theft.
For AntiTheft to function, we must collect and store information about your
	phone and its approved users.
The types of data we collect include the
	following:



			a list of approved SIM cards;
	

			a phone number to notify you in the event of unauthorized SIM card
			replacement;
	

			a number where calls and messages can be forwarded in the event of
			theft;
	

			your mobile’s unique identifier or International Mobile Equipment
			Identity (IMEI) when you activate AntiTheft.
We use this data to locate and identify your lost device, and to help you
	report the lost device to police and cell phone carriers.
If the phone was
	stolen, it may block the thief from using the device.
The collected data is
	used to provide you the functionality.
Last Known Location is a feature within AntiTheft, also off by default.
When you activate the feature, we send more frequent location updates to
	the server to help you track your device's last known location.
==========
Avast Call Blocker


	The Call Blocker feature is only available on Android versions below 9.0.
This paragraph does not apply to Android 9.0 and above.
Call Blocker is a
	feature of AMS which allows you to block unwanted callers.
It is off by
	default.
==========
When on, we build a database of SPAM callers by analysing patterns
	of high volume callers across our user base.
When you (an AMS user) call a third party, or a third party calls you, we
	will have the following record in our database: the third-party phone
	number, the time of the call, and an anonymous key code number assigned to
	this particular record.
This allows us to count the number of calls made to
	a specific recipient in order to evaluate whether the call is a spam or
	not.
==========
Your GUID is disconnected from this data.
We do not collect the phone numbers of our users.
Therefore, the data we
	collect from you is anonymized and we are not able or intending to trace
	the call record to you.
However, we are able to see the phone numbers of third parties who called
	our AMS users in general or which phone numbers were called by our AMS
	users.
The purpose of this data collection is to identify high volume callers;
	therefore, we look at aggregations, not at individuals.
==========
You may shut off
	this feature in your discretion via the product Settings.
Avast Wi-Fi Finder


	Avast Wi-Fi Finder for Android provides information about free hotspots.
It
	is based on crowdsourced data, meaning that every user has to willingly
	contribute to the database.
We use the data collected for sharing with other Wi-Fi Finder users.
You
	may turn off data collection by not using the WIFI sharing feature.
==========
We
	collect this data:



			the location of the device when you use “submit a hotspot”;
	

			names of hotspots you submit to the database;
	

			some technical information about the network (speed, signal
			strength, security assessment, and frequency
	

			mac address and IP Address of the device;
	

			the install GUID and hardware identifier; and
	

			hotspot passwords.
In some Android versions, we need your location permission to scan Wi-Fi
	networks for security threats.
Any time we’re given the location
	permission, we may use it to refine our databases of Wi-Fi networks,
	including the locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and dangerous networks.
Avast Battery Saver


	The Battery Saver is an app that helps you monitor what apps are running in
	the background, speed up your mobile device, and save the battery.
==========
We
	collect AppInfo for the purpose of delivering this feature.
Battery Saver has a functionality, Smart Profile that can switch your
	device setting automatically to preserve the battery upon an event you set
	up, for example, when you come home.
In doing this, you have to reveal your
	location Wi-Fi or give us permission to use your Android mobile operating
	system’s location so that the event can be triggered.
This data is stored
	locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.
==========
We track the usage of this feature via Google Analytics, so we would know
	the demographic and geographic statistics of our users who have enabled
	Smart Profile.
We do not have information on the individual user.
As Google
	is a third party, the third-party privacy policy applies.
Smart Profile is enabled by default, but you may disable this via product
	settings.
==========
AppInfo


	AppInfo is an Avast library used in our product features such as App
	Insights, for the purposes of displaying how much time is spent on the
	device, broken down by app, by total data, and by day; enhancing our cloud
	based threat detection; improving other Avast products; for Avast
	marketing; for third party ads; and for analytics.
To this end, it analyzes
	device information such as: language; make and model; operating system
	version; telecom provider; and city and country.
Additionally, we observe
	the list of currently installed apps; the time when an app is installed or
	removed; the source of an installed app; Wi-Fi and carrier data consumption
	per app; time that an app is in the foreground; battery and CPU consumption
	per app; and which permissions are granted to each app.
The specific scope
	of information collected is dependent on permissions granted to the app.
We
	may share statistical data that has been anonymized and aggregated
	geographically and so, cannot be used to identify individuals, with third
	parties for trend analytics.
You can always turn off the specific features
	which use data from the AppInfo library in your settings, or change your
	preferences for the processing of this data in the privacy settings.
==========
Avast ApkRep


	We use the ApkRep to build a database of Android apps sourced by users of
	AMS.
We collect and store hashes of app files together with the
	installation GUID, as well as metadata about the apps (e.g. application
	package name, application signing certificate information, source market
	identifier and file size).
We process this on the legal basis of our
	legitimate interests in analysing your data to find infectious apps and to
	update our virus databases, which is necessary to continuously improve AMS
	to keep you secure.
==========
Avast Android CleanUp, AVG Cleaner, AVG Cleaner for Xperia, and CCleaner
	for Android (Piriform)


	Avast Android CleanUp, AVG Cleaner, AVG Cleaner for Xperia, and CCleaner
	for Android (Piriform) access your device storage to delete data that is
	not in use.
You will be asked to allow your Android operating system to
	access your device storage.
The feature sees what’s in your device, for
	example the apps and files you have downloaded, ranging from your music
	playlist to photos.
However, everything takes place locally on your device
	and nothing is transmitted to our servers.
Since we do not collect or store any personal data, any data collected is
	anonymous.
We also offer you a Cloud service connection for you to back up your files
	so nothing important gets deleted.
You may sign-in to Google Drive, Dropbox
	or Microsoft OneDrive directly from CleanUp.
==========
This feature is optional.
If
	you use this feature, you will be storing your files with a third party and
	thus this is subject to the third party’s terms of service and privacy
	policy.
Avast Family Space


	Avast Family Space (for parents) and Avast Companion (for children) are
	mobile applications available for Android and iOS.
Family Space provides
	the following functionality:
	

	(i) location monitoring - this feature monitors the location of connected
	devices using their GPS location.
The administrator (parent) can create and
	save locations such as “home”, “school”, “gym”, “friend’s house”, etc., and
	receive alerts when the connected device (child’s device) arrives or
	departs a saved location.
This feature also allows the parent to see the
	child's location on demand, receive scheduled updates about their current
	location, and see their location history.
==========
The connected device also has the
	option to share its location with the administrator’s device and with other
	connected devices.
The connected device may also request the information of
	other users in the family.
The parent may set permissions in the connected
	device, which will enable or disable the sharing of information from the
	child’s device.
This particular feature and its functionality may, however,
	be affected by the scope of permissions granted by the specific user.
For
	example, if the parent does not grant the permission to access their
	location, the ability to share this information would be limited.
==========
(ii) content filters - this feature blocks the connected device from
	accessing blocked content (apps and websites).
This setting is set by the
	parent (administrator) through the application in their device.
Filter
	defaults are suggested based on the age range of the users of the connected
	device, which can be selected and further modified by the administrator.
(iii) insights - this feature allows the administrator to monitor the
	connected device’s access of named apps or devices.
The feature also
	provides activity summaries from the connected device and location history.
Additionally, administrators can set pause on internet access and set time
	limits on the connected device.
==========
Avast processes only the data necessary to provide this functionality.
This
	data is processed in Avast’s cloud service environment.
This processing
	includes the following categories of data for both the administrator’s
	device and the connected device: (i) Account Data of the parent
	(administrator), (ii) Information about the users of the connected device
	which the administrator chooses to input into the application, such as
	names, age range or photos, (iii) location data of the devices; (iv)
	information concerning app usage history and content engagement, including
	names of apps, names or categories of blocked content and time limits; (v)
	device and network information.
==========
AVG Alarm Clock


	When you install Alarm Clock, which is an app that you can set to wake you
	up, you will also receive by default, weather (via Open Weather), news (via
	Taboola), and third party ads via regular ad SDKs.
You may opt out of
	receiving news and weather reports via Settings – My Day Dashboard.
Through Alarm Clock, we collect and process anonymous statistical data in
	our own analytics system and we share pseudonymized or anonymised data with
	third-party analytics and crash reporting.
We collect only the personal
	data necessary for us to enable our third-party providers to send you
	relevant information.
You may opt out of third party analytics through
	Settings – Personal Privacy.
Open Weather


	You receive weather information from Open Weather, our third-party service
	provider.
This service is on by default and we share your approximate
	location data, so you will receive relevant weather forecasts, for example,
	East Coast, USA.
However, if you wish to have the weather forecast for a
	specific location, for example, Brooklyn, New York, you have to turn on
	this setting.
==========
Apart from Alarm Clock, you can receive Open Weather on your
	charge screen when you install AntiVirus, Cleaner and Battery Saver.
Taboola


	Alarm Clock will also show you news articles from Taboola, our third-party
	news aggregator.
We share some of your data with Taboola, such as your IP
	Address, your device, browser and operating system, your hardware ID, news
	websites you visited and your preferred language, for you to receive locale
	specific news.
==========
AVG Gallery


	Gallery is a smart app that you can install in your Android to help you
	organise your photos and videos into significant moments.
Through Gallery,
	we collect analytics data in our internal analytics system, and through
	third party analytics like Google Analytics and third party crash reporting
	(Crashlytics).
AVG Gallery Doctor


	Gallery Doctor is a free app that helps you free up storage space in your
	mobile by identifying bad & similar photos in your Android gallery.
It
	does not collect any personal data.
==========
VPN Products Privacy Policy


	Using a virtual private network (“VPN”) is like going undercover while you
	are on the Internet.
We provide VPN services that allow you to be on the
	Internet anonymously and securely from anywhere in the world.
While we
	respect your privacy and take strenuous measures to protect it, it does not
	mean that you are totally anonymous to us.
In this section of the Privacy Policy, we would like you to know what kind
	of personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us when you use
	our VPN services.
We treat this data differently than we do for other applications as it can
	be of such a sensitive nature, so we want you to understand clearly how we
	process it, on what legal bases, whether we transfer or disclose it, and
	how long we retain it, in accordance with relevant laws.
1.
==========
Personal Data Collection and Use


	Personal data is understood as any information that relates to an
	identified or identifiable natural person, and includes the information you
	provide to us while using our VPN services.
More specifically, we may collect and process data about you in the
	following situations:


1.1 Account Creation and Management


	If you create an account with us (note: this is necessary in order for you
	to use some of our applications or some of their functions), we will need
	some information about you.
This is the data that is created and stored for
	the management of your account:





Account data


What we use it for




Email address


To send you purchase receipts, communications, and occasional product news




Username


To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service




License Key


To activate your subscription




Subscription renewal date


To tell us until when the account is valid




Trial User


To add a trial period before the account is charged





	All of the above data is stored for as long as you use our service, as it
	is necessary for us to provide it.
You can see all of this data by logging
into our	Privacy Preference portal.
1.2 Service Data from our VPN Servers


	If you use our VPN service, we strictly collect the minimum amount of
	information needed to provide and operate our VPN service, as well as keep
	it running safely and efficiently.
This is the data we collect to make sure
	our VPN infrastructure works (“Service Data”):






Service data


What we use it for




Timestamps of your connections


To manage the number of concurrent active connections, and handle abuse.Example: We use them to stop brute force password cracking attempts on user accounts.
==========
The subnet of your originating IP address.E.g.
We anonymize the last octet to protect your privacy: 92.143.234.000 We don’t collect exact IP addresses that could ID you.
To plan for increased network demand and capacity.Example: Help us decide to add servers in a region if we see a rise in demand there, or help troubleshoot issues with a specific ISP.
IP address of the VPN server you’re using.
To troubleshoot our service and plan for new network capacity.Example: Identify when an IP address suddenly doesn’t work for accessing certain services, and act to resolve the issue.
Amount of data transmittedE.G.
5GB up or down


To plan for new network capacity and server improvements.Example: We may deploy more capacity to meet demand and make sure speeds stay up for all users.
==========
We store this data on servers for 30 days, after which time it is deleted
	on a rolling basis — so data created on Jan 3rd gets deleted on February
	2nd, for example.
1.3 Data we don’t collect on our VPN service.
Period


	We do not collect, store or log any of the following data:



		Any complete originating IP address that could identify you.
==========
Any DNS queries while connected.
We rely on our own secure DNS servers,
		so your queries are also protected from exposure to 3rd parties.
Any activity logs: the applications you use, the services you use, the
		websites you connect to — basically anything you do online.
==========
1.4 Service Data from our VPN Clients


	In order to make sure our VPN clients do their job properly and improve
	them, we have to know how people, as a whole, interact with them.
This data
	pertains to interactions taken in the app, and cannot be used to uncover
	what you’re using the VPN service for.
Client Data


What we use it for




OS VersionE.g.
Windows 10


For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planningExample: Which platforms do our users most like to use?
Avast SecureLine VPN versionE.G.
SecureLine for Android version 4.1


For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planningExample: Is our latest update deploying well?
==========
Application EventsE.g.
Turned on auto-connection, Uninstalled, etc.
You can opt out of this in the settings.
==========
To plan product developmentExample: Is a new client-side feature we introduced popular?
Are people uninstalling after our latest release?
We delete this data on a rolling 2-year basis (i.e. data created on Jan 2,
	2019, will get deleted on Jan 2, 2021).
==========
1.5 Third-party Analytics In Our VPN Products


	To analyze the application events mentioned section 1.4, and understand how
	our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our
	own analytics tools as much as possible.
But sometimes, we need to rely on
	third-party tools that address specific issues in ways we don’t have the
	ability to replicate.
Whenever possible, we anonymize, masque, or in other
	ways try to limit your exposure.
Here are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy
	policies.
==========
You will find that these tools are also listed under the broader
section	Service Data of
	this privacy policy which covers all Avast products, however in the
	interest of full transparency, we cover here in detail how the relevant
	ones are used for our VPN products:


Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android


	Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of
	our applications.
While Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID
	or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, we’ve opted to use our own anonymizing
	identifiers instead.
Therefore it doesn’t contain any information that
	could personally identify you.
Still, you can opt out of providing us with
	this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.
Still, you can opt out of providing us with this anonymized application
	performance data in our application settings.
Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android


	This Google service helps us to improve the application stability, pinpoint
	things that don’t work, and improve your experience.
Its implementation
	doesn’t contain any information that can personally identify you.
==========
Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to	Google’s privacy policies.
AppsFlyer Analytics on iOS and Android


	AppsFlyer helps us understand how effective our marketing campaigns are by
	letting us know which ones directed you to us.
The data collected here is
	subject to AppsFlyer’s privacy policy.
You can opt out of AppsFlyer Analytics in the settings of our applications,
	or by opting out by following the
	
		instructions in their privacy policy
	
	.
Deprecated Analytics


	If you’re still on older versions of our applications, the following
	analytics are embedded in them.
==========
We highly recommend that you upgrade to
	later versions as they no longer use these:



		Facebook Analytics on older versions of our Android apps: we used to
		use this to know how many people opened an app, how much time they
		spent in it, and other information about how they interacted with them.
You can find
		
			Facebook’s privacy policy here
		
		.
HockeyApp on older versions of our macOS and iOS apps: This was used to
		do beta distribution, crash reporting, user metrics, feedback, and
		more.
This tool belongs to
		
			Microsoft and you can find their privacy policy here
		
		.

Where and how long we store your personal data


2.1 Where we store your data


	When you use our service, you may be using servers located in a variety of
	different countries.
==========
However, there is a difference between use and
	storage.
What little information that gets generated by your use of our
	infrastructure does not get stored outside of the Czech Republic.
There may be some instances where, as a matter of necessity, we need to
	transfer data outside of these two jurisdictions.
When we process the data
	within our group, regardless of where we are, we always implement the same
	level of data protection afforded by the European General Data Protection
	Regulation to all personal data we process.
Where we cooperate with third
	parties which are involved in data processing, we legally bind any party we
	deal with to adhere to those high levels of protection with standardized
	contracts approved by the European Commission, and to ensure your rights
	are protected in accordance with this privacy policy.
In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures
	to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and
	once we receive it.
We always strive to protect your data to the maximum
	extent we can.
==========
By using the service, you acknowledge this transfer, storing or processing


2.2 How long we store your data


	Concerning storage or retention periods, the specific terms applicable to
	the various types of data used for various purposes are noted in their
	respective sections.
After these periods elapse, we will delete this data
	and no longer use it for that specific purpose.
These retention periods may be longer where it is necessary for us to
	comply with our legal obligations or legal orders, resolve disputes, and
	enforce our agreements, including in the court of law.
3.
==========
Disclosure of your VPN information


	As a rule, we do not disclose any information to other commercial parties,
	with the following exceptions:


3.1 The Avast Group


	As we are part of the Avast Group, information may be shared with members
	of the Avast Group in order to execute on the provisions of this service,
	for direct marketing, or to help our product development.
In all cases,
	they are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
3.2 Provision of services


	It may be necessary to share some data with select parties to deliver the
	product or service you require — such as with a payment card provider who
	we use to process your credit card transaction, or to do perform website
	analytics.
The information that is collected and shared with those parties
	is outlined above.
3.3 Legal requirements


	In the event we are served with valid subpoenas, warrants, or other legal
	documents (for example, documents concerning the sale of all or part of our
	business or a merger), or where applicable law compels us to comply, or
	when we are required to defend the rights or property of the Avast Group,
	including the security of our products and services, and the personal
	safety, property, or other rights of our customers and employees — we may
	share your personal data as collected above.
==========
3.4 Whatever the circumstance


	“Avast does NOT store the originating IP addresses of our users when
	connected to our VPN service, and thus cannot identify users when provided
	the IP address of one of our servers.
We are also completely unable to
	disclose any information about the applications people use, the services
	they employ, or the websites they visit while using our VPN.
We simply do
	NOT store this information.”
