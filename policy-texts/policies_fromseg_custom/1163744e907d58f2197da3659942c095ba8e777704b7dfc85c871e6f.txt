==========
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors to the site when they list a car for sale, perform a search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, or initiate a transaction, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our website and review our email newsletters and other email messages.
Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site by third parties, may be gathering information, as well, through processes we don't control.
Searches and Listings To make use of certain features on our site, visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their interests so that we can tailor the information we provide to their needs.
For example, to help you find the car you want close to home, we need to know what kind of car you're looking for and your zip code.
We ask you to provide this information when you perform a search.
We use this information to help you find the car you're looking for.
If you find a listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we'll share with the seller the contact information you supply through our online form.
==========
If you call a dealer to inquire about a car listed on our site, we may provide the dealer with the date, time, and duration of your call, as well as the number from which the call originated.
We may provide the dealer with your phone number and a record of the date and time that you tried to reach the dealer, even if your attempt was unsuccessful.
After receiving this information, the dealer may call you back for marketing purposes.
When you list a car for sale, we ask for information on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers.
We also ask for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card.
==========
We use this information to create your ad and to process your payment.
Sweepstakes and Other Promotions From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our website.
If you enter a sweepstakes or promotional contest, we'll ask you to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address).
Among other things, we'll need this information to contact you if you win, and we may use this information for marketing purposes.
We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, which we'll identify in the contest rules.
We may also share this information with shipping or fulfillment companies or other third-party service providers who are responsible for some aspects of administering our promotions, such as conducting drawings, and/or delivering prizes to winners.
If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the contest or sweepstakes registration form or to provide it to co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.
==========
Email Addresses If you provide us your email address, from time to time we'll send you emails that may include automotive information, special promotions and other commercial offers that we think may be of interest to you.
Though we hope you'll find these communications informative and useful, if you don't, you can always unsubscribe by following the simple instructions included in each email.
And you can opt-out of receiving these types of commercial offers at all by indicating, when you list a car for sale or inquire about a car listed on our website, that you'd prefer not to receive these communications.

LINKS AND FEATURES OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER PROVIDERS
To make our website more valuable to our visitors, we feature some products and services that come from other providers.
Our finance, insurance, warranty, and inspection services, for example, are made available through cooperative arrangements with companies that specialize in providing such services.
We share with these third parties such information as is necessary for them to provide the products or services.
Of course, our site includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control.
When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services.
When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services.
The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours.
If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from their site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.
OTHER DISCLOSURES
We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Visitor Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our customers, the public or AutoTrader.com.
As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.
To ensure that the email marketing preferences of our visitors are honored, we may share email addresses collected on our website with advertisers (or their designated agents) for the limited purpose of identifying and removing from our distribution lists and/or the advertiser's distribution lists the email addresses of any persons who have "unsubscribed" or otherwise indicated a preference not to receive commercial electronic mail messages from, or transmitted on behalf of, the relevant advertiser.
In the unlikely event that AutoTrader.com LLC, one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.
==========
We may allow others to search some of our databases (our listings database, for example) and to analyze the data they find there or aggregate it with other data, either for their business purposes, or ours.
Though some of the information in our databases may be personally identifying (such as the contact information included in a vehicle listing), we'll only allow searches of the portions of our database that contain information that is otherwise publicly available on our website.
When we use other companies to help us operate our site or improve the services we offer to you, we may provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to perform their services.
We require that these companies commit to use the information only to perform the services that we request.
SECURITY
Information we gather on our website is stored within AutoTrader.com-controlled databases (or databases hosted on our behalf) on servers maintained in protected environments.
==========
Any credit card information you provide us is secured for transmission over the Internet using industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.
(Click here to learn more about the SSL protocol.)
However, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
And, of course, any information you include in a vehicle listing is available to anyone with Internet access.
