Limiting access to your site.
Piczo gives you the option to protect your Web pages by adding a viewer’s password.
We recommend that you give your viewers a different password than the one you use to author your site.
Note that if you provide your viewer’s password to others, they could forward this information to others, who could also view your Web pages and photos.
If you do not protect your site through a viewer’s password, your Web pages will be visible by the general public and they could view or download your pictures.
