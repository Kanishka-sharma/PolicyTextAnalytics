As with many websites, the Website uses a technology called "cookies."
A cookie is a collection of information that gets stored on the hard drive of your computer when browsing the Internet.
These small bits of code automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website.
Cookies also let us know how many people visit the Website and where visitors go on the Website.
==========
In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like how many times a user has been on certain pages.
For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences.
By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not.
Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies.

The Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons.
Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites.

We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data.
An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university.
Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.
At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of the Website.

We may combine this information with personally identifiable information we obtain from you directly on the Website or any other of our other websites, or from third parties.
Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request pages from the Website.
Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information.
When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.
==========
If you conduct a financial transaction with the Website, such as subscribe to services offered on the Website, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information.
