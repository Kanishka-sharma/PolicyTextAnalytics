Our 
          TigerDirect website is registered with site identification authorities 
          to enable your browser to confirm our security identity before any transmission 
          is sent.
With this technology, the identity of our site is automatically 
          confirmed behind the scenes prior to the transmission of any customer 
          information requested to complete an online order and ensures that your 
          data reaches your intended target or your browser notifies you (prior 
          to your sending any personal information) that the potential receiving 
          site looks suspicious and should be avoided.
Security Guarantee If you 
          are using a security-enabled browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 
          version 2.1 or greater, or Netscape Navigator version 2.0 or greater), 
          the information you send us regarding your purchase is encrypted, making 
          it extremely difficult to read even if it is wrongly intercepted.
At 
          TigerDirect, we utilize industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
          technology to allow for the encryption of: potentially sensitive information 
          such as your name and address and other critically sensitive information 
          like your credit card number.
Standing behind our security technology, 
          we also provide our Website 
          Security Guarantee, further ensuring that you are protected every 
          time you buy online with us.
