What are cookies?
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which your computer or mobile device downloads when you visit a website.
When you return to websites — or visit other websites that use the same cookies — they recognise these cookies and therefore your browsing device.
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how this website is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience.
Cookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.
You can learn about the cookies we use and how to manage them below.
What type of cookies Bank use?
The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into 1 of 4 categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality and Targeting.

Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you.
Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you've previously made or personalise your browsing experience.
Targeting Cookies
These cookies are used to tailor marketing to you and your interests.
They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.
==========
They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organisations such as advertisers.
Although these cookies can track your visits to other websites, they don’t usually know who you are.
