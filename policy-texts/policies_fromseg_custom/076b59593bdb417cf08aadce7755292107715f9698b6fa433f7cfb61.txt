About "Cookies"

While visiting sites within the NIH.GOV domain, you may occasionally encounter a Web page that employs “cookies”.
A cookie is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk allowing our server to "remember" specific information about your session while you are connected.
Requests to send cookies from NIH Web pages are not designed to collect information about you, but only about your browser "session."
The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of these Web pages.
The cookie and the information about your session will be destroyed automatically shortly after you close your browser--it is not permanently stored on your computer.
Unless an NIH web page specifically notifies you otherwise, we will not collect and maintain personal information about you.
==========
To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished conducting business with a Web site that uses cookies.
If you are concerned about the potential use of information gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie.
Most Internet browsers 
have settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies.
