Scenestealer Privacy Policy
Our commitment to privacy
Scenestealer respects your rights to privacy and to choose what information you would like to receive or give.
The nature of the service provided by Scenestealer means that we might obtain certain information about you.
What information is collected?
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
Scenestealer may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a Scenestealer website or the website of one of our business partners, including website owners, advertisers, and their representatives (collectively referred to as “Business Partners”).
This anonymous data includes information such as a consumer’s IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a consumer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a consumer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third-party advertising technology vendor.
We, and/or a third-party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels.
==========
In addition, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about a visitor as part of the registration process at our wholly owned websites or for our services (collectively referred to as “Scenestealer Properties”).
Examples of the non-personally identifiable information that may be requested and collected with the visitor’s consent include age, gender, and interests.
None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as “non-personally identifiable data”), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual.
Consumers may elect not to allow us to use this anonymous data by following the Cookie Opt-out procedures set forth below.
==========
Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
We do not ask for personally identifiable information on Scenestealer Properties other than what is outlined below for the purpose of working with our Business Partners.
At some of the websites of our Business Partners, they may request and collect personally identifiable information about a visitor as part of their registration process.
Visitors to our Business Partners’ websites should review each Business Partner’s privacy policy.
==========
How is this information used?
The non-personally identifiable data that Scenestealer and/or its third-party advertising technology vendors collect are used to better target advertisements and offers to consumers across the different websites they visit within the Scenestealer network of websites.
Scenestealer may also use the non-personally identifiable data to better target content to consumers in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each consumer.
The data are also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different consumers.
In addition, the data may be combined with information collected from other sources so that we may better serve consumers with advertisements and offers that may be of interest to them.
==========
We may also share non-personally identifiable data with our subsidiaries and third-party partners for similar use.
Scenestealer may retain non-personally identifiable data for up to 3 months.
After 3 months, we may store the non-personally identifiable data in aggregate form for up to 18 months.
==========
If a consumer elects to provide Scenestealer with personally identifiable data, we may utilise such data for marketing purposes.
Consumers who have provided personally identifiable data may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the Data Opt-Out procedures set forth below.
The Business Information that Scenestealer Business Partners provide to us for the purpose of entering or maintaining a business relationship with Scenestealer are used only for the purpose of administering our Business Partner programs, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc., and are stored for as long as the normal course of business requires.

==========
How secure is my information?
At all times we have security measures and technical safeguards in place to prevent unauthorised access, theft or loss of any information.
Our employees are aware of and accountable for compliance with these procedures.
==========
How do I opt-out?
If you would like to opt-out of any data gathering and analysis by Scenestealer you can do so by using the opt-out link on our Cookie Information page.
Please note that if you decide to click the opt-out link we will be required to add a cookie within your web browser to recognise that you have chosen to opt-out.
If you delete this cookie then your status will resume as opt-in.
Please be aware that If you choose to opt-out of interest-based ads, it does not mean you will no longer see advertising from Scenestealer.
It means we will no longer be able to deliver ads to you that are tailored to your interests, or to limit the number of times you see the same ad on different web pages.
As a result, you may start to see the same ad over and over again and/or see ads that have no relevance to you at all.
