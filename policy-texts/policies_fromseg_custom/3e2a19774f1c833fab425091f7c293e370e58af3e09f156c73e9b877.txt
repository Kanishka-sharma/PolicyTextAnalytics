You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Compete has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Compete has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).
==========

==========
Each month during the Subscription Period, you will be entitled to access only the number of reports specified in the Billing Form ("Monthly Allotment").
You will not be able to carry over to a subsequent month any unused portion of your Monthly Allotment as the unused Monthly Allotment will expire at the end of the associated month.

==========
The Subscription Fee is payable in advance for the Subscription Period, regardless of whether the Subscription Period is on an annual or a month-to-month basis.

Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-transferable.
