Unclaimed property:
The provinces of Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia have introduced regulations which set out specific responsibilities for the administration of Unclaimed Property if the last known address of the owner of the property was within one of these provinces.
The legislation is designed to ensure that all reasonable efforts are made to return Unclaimed Property to its owner.
Unclaimed Property refers to securities and/or money held in accounts, without recent activity (3 years), where the current location of the client is not known to us and the last known address is in one of Quebec, Alberta or British Columbia.

If you have an enquiry or claim in respect of Unclaimed Property either on your own behalf or, for example, in your capacity as attorney under a power of attorney or as estate trustee, please provide full details including your full name and account number in writing to wmcaunclaimed@rbc.com.

Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities, including mutual fund securities, involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only.
Should you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan as required by its terms remains the same even if the value of the securities purchased declines.
Unless otherwise indicated, securities purchased from or through the Member Companies are not insured by a government deposit insurer, or guaranteed by Royal Bank or any of the member companies and may fluctuate in value.
