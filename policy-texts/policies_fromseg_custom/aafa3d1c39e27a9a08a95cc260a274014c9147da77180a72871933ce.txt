One can visit our Web sites with privacy.
A Web site visitor can choose 
            to provide customer-specific information by ordering a product or 
            service, sending us e-mail, registering on a company Web site, or 
            entering surveys, contests, or sweepstakes.
Any information provided 
            by a Web site visitor is held strictly confidential within Cingular 
            Wireless, or its authorized agent and will not be sold to any other 
            organization or business, but will be shared as necessary with third 
            party suppliers, vendors, or agents whose services you use, or from 
            when you make requests or purchases.
On some Web pages users can order products, make requests or register 
            to receive information.
Such customer-specific information will be 
            used to fulfill the specific request or purpose for which it was provided.
In addition, such voluntarily provided information may be occasionally 
            used to offer products and services that may be of interest.
==========
While Cingular Wireless may use this information to contact or send 
            materials to you for marketing purposes, we will take commercially 
            reasonable steps to safeguard the information from unauthorized access.
We will not make customer-specific information that is gathered on 
            our site available to unaffiliated organizations for commercial purposes 
            unrelated to the business of Cingular Wireless, except with the customer's 
            permission, as required by law, for safety reasons, or to survey customer 
            satisfaction, under nondisclosure protection.
==========
We use the information 
            provided when placing an order to complete that order.
We do not share 
            that information with outside parties except as necessary to fulfill 
            the online order (e.g., providing the "ship to" address and other 
            necessary information to our shipper or the vendor.)
We may also use 
            that information to offer other products or services of interest.
We do not sell customer information from our Web sites to any outside 
            party.
Information collected online may be used within Cingular Wireless, 
            or by an authorized agent to inform the user about services and products 
            of potential interest.
Customers might be contacted by telephone, 
            direct mail, Interactive Messaging/SMS or e-mail to keep them up-to-date 
            on new products and services offered by Cingular Wireless, or an authorized 
            agent.
Cingular Wireless does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer 
            outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors 
            voluntarily provide in any registration or contest submission.
Examples 
            of information that Cingular Wireless may collect include: name, address, 
            email address, and wireless number.
This information is used to better 
            understand visitors' use of the Cingular Wireless site and to support 
            related transactions made on the site.
However, this data in an aggregate 
            form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, 
            or other uses.
==========
For example, the majority of visitors to Cingular.com 
            own a wireless phone.
Cingular Wireless may also use email addresses 
            and other personally identifiable information to contact visitors 
            who communicate with us.
For example, we direct email to visitors 
            who provide us with their email addresses for specific purposes such 
            as receiving our email newsletters or being notified if they have 
            won one of our contests.
==========
A trusted third party may conduct the actual 
            sending of the email offer.
Cingular Wireless requires that these 
            third parties hold the information we provide in strict confidence.
Third parties cannot use the information for any purpose other than 
            the particular offer of goods or services approved by Cingular Wireless.
==========
Visitors will be given a choice when registering whether they would 
            like to be on Cingular Wireless' Interactive Messaging/SMS or e-mail 
            lists, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such 
            messages from Cingular Wireless.
If you sign up to receive an email newsletter, each newsletter contains 
            instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter (do to 
            space limitations, Interactive Messaging and SMS may not contain such 
            instructions).
If at anytime a visitor chooses to no longer receive 
            such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should 
            unsubscribe using the profile update link within the email, or simply 
            reply to any Cingular Wireless email sent to them and type REMOVE 
            as the subject of their reply (Interactive Messaging and SMS may not 
            accept such replies and you will need to visit the appropriate site 
            to opt out).
==========
In order to create a better electronic community, we keep track of 
            patterns of use in the emails we send out.
We note which links are 
            clicked in our email communications to tell us what areas are of the 
            most interest to our opt-in recipients.
We may use this information 
            to better personalize the content and promotions that we send you 
            in future mailings.
==========
A "referrer" is the information passed along by 
            a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is 
            automatically gathered by our Web server.
This information is used 
            to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information 
            tailored to your interests.
You will not be personally identified 
            from this information.
==========
Subscribers to "My Wireless Window" will be asked for personal information 
            in the "Registration" section of our Web site where we collect information 
            to provide you with stock quotes, weather, lottery results, news, 
            etc.
We use this information gathered from you to provide you with 
            personalized information through our "My Wireless Window" Web site 
            and through your wireless handset.
==========
We develop summary, not individual, 
            reports for our advertisers.
An example of a summary report might 
            be "100,000 people clicked on advertisement "X" today and of those 
            people, 60% had indicated an interest in a specific stock quote."
==========

            spend on each page.
We use this information to continually monitor 
            and improve our Web site.
==========
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and appropriate 
            use of information, appropriate physical, electronic and managerial 
            safeguards have been established to secure the information collected 
            online.

            selectively.
You can check your hard drive for cookie files.
For PCs, 
            look for "cookies.txt" files on your hard drive.
On a Macintosh, look 
            for "magic cookies."
