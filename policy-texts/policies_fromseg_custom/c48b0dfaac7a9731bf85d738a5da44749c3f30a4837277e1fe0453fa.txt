Personal data includes data such as your name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, driver’s license number, as well as other data (for example, demographic data, T-Mobile passwords or PINs, payment data, device data, call records and other service data, profile data, and location data) when it is linked to data that identifies you.
For purposes of this policy, personal data includes “personal information” and similar terms as defined under applicable privacy laws.

By purchasing, accessing or using our Products or Services or otherwise engaging with us, you acknowledge and consent to our collection, use, and sharing of personal data as described in this privacy policy.
Accordingly, we encourage you to read this policy carefully and contact us with any questions.

Personal Data We Derive
We may derive personal data or draw inferences about your preferences or characteristics based on the other personal data we collect.

When We Share Personal Data About You
We may disclose personal data to third parties as follows:
With Your Consent or at your Direction
We may disclose personal data about you to third parties with your consent, which may be obtained in writing, online, or orally.
We may also share your personal data with third parties when you intentionally direct us to do so or when you use our Products or Services to intentionally interact with third parties.
To the Primary Account Holder
We may disclose personal data about an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account).
If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer and we may provide personal data about you or your use of our Products and Services to them or others at their direction.
To Provide Special Discounts
When you receive special or discounted pricing, terms, or other benefits through another party’s agreement with us (for example, an employee discount), we may provide enough personal data to that party to verify your eligibility for benefits under their agreement with us and to calculate any associated discounts.
==========
To Our Service Providers
We may share personal data with unaffiliated companies or individuals we hire or work with to provide services or perform business functions on our behalf.
These service providers need access to the personal data to perform the functions we’ve requested of them.
Examples of service providers we engage include print, mail, or email vendors, delivery companies, payment processors, web hosting vendors, cloud service providers, consultants, digital advertising vendors, contest or sweepstakes operators, and social media advertising networks.
==========
These service providers are contractually required to treat the personal data we provide as confidential, and to use the personal data only to provide the services we have requested they perform on our behalf.
To Identity Verification and Fraud Prevention Services
To help protect our customers and others from fraud, we may share limited personal data (such as name, address, account status, SIM change history) with trusted partners that provide fraud prevention services to banks and other entities.
Personal data is only shared with our identity verification and fraud prevention partners in connection with specific, individual transactions (such as a credit application with a bank).
We share only the minimum data required to support the fraud prevention service and take other steps, including mandating strict contractual provisions, to ensure the personal data we share is used solely for those limited purposes.
These contractual provisions prohibit partners from sharing the personal data we provide to them with their downstream customers (such as banks).
Instead, the fraud prevention partners use the personal data we provide to create and share risk assessments or flags that highlight possible fraudulent activity or other misuse.
Caller ID Providers
We may share your mobile number and associated name with third parties that facilitate Caller ID and similar services across multiple mobile carriers.
Please see the “Directories and Caller ID” section below for further details about our sharing of this information;
In a Business Transfer or Transaction
We may disclose or transfer personal data about you as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which case the personal data could be transferred to third parties as a business asset in the transaction – subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
We may also share information with banks for purposes of transferring loans in connection with your device financing.
==========
For Legal Process & Protection
We may disclose personal data to third parties involved in legal process or protection matters, including government authorities, where we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary, including:
To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
To enforce or apply agreements, or initiate, render, bill, and collect for services and products (including to collection agencies to obtain payment for our products and services);
To protect the rights, interests, property or safety of T-Mobile or others;
In connection with claims, disputes, or litigation – in court or elsewhere;
To protect users of our Services and other carriers or providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services, and other fraudulent activity;
To facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; and
In an emergency.
How We Protect Personal Data About You
We use a variety of administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your personal data against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use while it is under our control.
We maintain authentication procedures when you contact us by phone or in retail locations to help ensure that access is provided only to the primary account holder or authorized users of the account.
Online access to your personal data is protected through passwords and other safeguards.
For multi-line accounts, the primary account holder (if applicable) is authorized to access information for all the devices and lines on the account.
Other users may generally access online account information (including CPNI) related only to assigned line.
The primary account holder, however, may designate additional or more limited access rights for other users on the account.
Enterprise customer accounts are protected through authentication and access methods that may vary from those used by individual consumers.
==========
Despite our security efforts, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personal data.
We maintain security incident response plans to investigate and remediate incidents involving unauthorized access to personal data.
We retain your personal data for as long as we have a business or tax need, or for as long as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require.
When we dispose of personal data, we use reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).
Other Important Information
This section contains additional information about our privacy practices that you may find helpful.
==========
Advertising
You may see T-Mobile and other advertisements on your devices - whether you are connected to our network or using another connection method (e.g., Wi-Fi or wireline connections).
In some cases, these ads may be targeted to your device based on information the advertiser has gathered about your prior online or offline behavior, or other data about your interests.
These online ads are sometimes called “interest-based” or “targeted” ads.
Like most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T-Mobile works with third-party advertising networks, which collect certain information about our site and app visitors, serve ads on our behalf, and measure their effectiveness.
The advertising networks that provide these ads may place cookies, web beacons, or use similar technologies on their partners’ websites and apps, including T-Mobile’s.
This technology allows them to track device activity over time across online properties.
Their use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies and those of the sites where they operate.
==========
To learn more about ad targeting and how to opt-out of interest-based ads, please see http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
For additional details, please review our article on Online Advertising in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Under California law we must disclose how we respond to Web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, we do not currently respond to the browser DNT signals when you use our services and products or interact with our websites or online services.
Children
We do not knowingly solicit minors (anyone under the age of 18) to purchase our Products or Services.
Generally, if you purchase and then authorize a minor to use our Products or Services by providing them a device or other access associated with your account, any personal data associated with their use will be treated as your personal data under this privacy policy.
Where applicable, if you are the primary account holder, you will have the ability to set the marketing and other preferences for any other lines on your account, including those for any minors to whom you provide a device.
Our Products and Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 nor designed to attract them, and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect personal data from anyone known to be under the age of 13.
We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including Internet browsing and app usage) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.
==========
CPNI
Some of the information we collect may be Customer Proprietary Network Information – or "CPNI.”
CPNI is data generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you, i.e., voice services.
CPNI does not include your name, address, or phone number.
Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted processes and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules.
For additional details, please review our article on CPNI in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Directories and Caller ID
We do not publish directories of our customers’ wireless numbers or make such numbers available to third parties for listing in their public directories without the customer’s prior consent.
We do, however, provide your number and associated name to enable Caller ID and similar services when you make a call.
You can request that we exclude your name from Caller ID by calling customer service.
See “How to Contact Us” below.
You can also block your number from being displayed temporarily for a specific call by entering *67 prior to entering the number you wish to call (including area code).
Note that this does not block your number when you call 911 or dial toll-free numbers such as 1-800 numbers.
Geolocation Data
If your mobile device is turned on, our network is collecting data about the device location.
We may use, provide access to, or disclose this network location data without your approval to provide and support our services, including to route wireless communications, operate and improve our network and business, detect and prevent fraud, provide emergency responders information about how to find you when you call 911, or as required by law or emergency.

Nevada Revised Statutes Sections 603A.300-360 requires us to disclose that Nevada consumers may request that website and online service operators like T-Mobile not sell certain information about them – referred to in the law as “covered information.”
T-Mobile does not currently engage in any sales of covered information as defined in the law.
Nevada consumers who nevertheless wish to submit a request that T-Mobile not sell their covered information may do so by clicking here and authenticating through their existing online account or establishing an authenticated account so we can record the request appropriately.
==========
INSIGHTS Program
We have developed a reporting program, INSIGHTS, in connection with a consumer research partner, to provide businesses with aggregate reports on mobile use trends and patterns.
For example, when city traffic planners need to understand traffic patterns, the INSIGHTS Program can use de-identified historical cell tower location data to create aggregate reports that identify the number of commuters on different highways at different times of day.
The consumer research reports created by our partner contain only aggregate data.
You may opt-out of having your de-identified mobile usage data used to help create the aggregate reports as set forth below in INSIGHTS Program Choice.
For more information, see the INSIGHTS article in our Privacy Center.
==========
Internet of Things
In many cases, we provide connectivity to Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices and services offered by other companies.
In such cases, we collect basic information about the information flowing over our network.
However, if you are a customer of a T-Mobile Internet of Things (“IoT”) Service (such as T-Mobile SyncUp Drive or MetroSMART Ride), we, and our application providers, also collect information from the IoT device and any related app to support the Service to which you have subscribed.
The information varies depending on the IoT Service, but may include personal data like contact information and location, audio, and device activity and measurement data.
For example, if you are a customer of the T-Mobile SyncUp Drive or MetroSMART Ride Service, the personal data includes driver behavior information such as information about acceleration, braking, speed, and engine RPMs, as well as vehicle location and Diagnostic Trouble Codes (“DTC”) related to your vehicle.
Location-Based Services
Depending on your device, you may be able to obtain services (such as mapping or ride-sharing service) that use the location of your device.
These services, referred to as Location-Based Services (“LBS”), are generally provided by third parties in connection with apps or websites.
==========
Third-party LBS providers generally use your device operating system’s location capabilities, which can determine location independent of our communications network, to derive device location.
We do not share network location data with third-party LBS providers for their LBS.
It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device and the privacy policies and terms under which third-party LBS are provided.
In some cases, T-Mobile may directly offer you LBS.
Where we do so, we will request your permission before we access precise location data to support the service.
==========
We may, however, use your IP address to estimate your general location without seeking specific consent (such as to infer what news or weather may be most relevant to you when browsing a T-Mobile website).
T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available here.
For additional details, please review our article on Location Services in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Technologies in our Retail Stores
Our partners have deployed beacons in some of our stores and we receive aggregate reports (none of which identify any individual or device) from these partners regarding store traffic that relies in part on information the partner collects from such beacons through mobile applications.
We may also use technology that tracks aggregate traffic patterns and wait times in our stores using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth identifiers (e.g., a MAC address).
Where such technology is used, we will provide a prominent notice at the location.
If you wish to exclude your device from such in-store mobile analytics, you can opt out at any time by entering your MAC address at https://optout.smart-places.org.
We may use video monitoring and recording in our retail stores for security purposes as well as traffic pattern and other analytics purposes.
We do not use facial recognition technology.
==========
Unaffiliated Websites and Mobile Applications
Our Products and Services may provide links or the ability to access third-party websites, or the ability to install or use third-party mobile apps on your device.
Those websites and apps are not controlled by T-Mobile or governed by this privacy policy.
These websites and mobile apps may collect personal data from or about you.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any website or mobile app that we do not control, and your interactions with such websites and mobile apps are governed solely by their respective privacy policies, not this privacy policy.
For additional details, please review our article on Device Apps in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Our Products and Services may also offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Products and Services with other media, and vice versa.
Your use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.
For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

Resetting your device advertising ID does not opt-out the device from targeted ads, but it may limit the ability to associate past activity with your device.
==========
