Specifically, the information we process and collect may include information like your IP address, device type, domain, referring website address, browser type and language and other technical information.
We refer to all of this information as “Digital Identifiers”.
In some countries, including countries in the European Union (“EU”), this information may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.
==========
What do we collect?
We process and collect the following information, which relates to an identifiable individual:

Cookie IDs.
Cookie IDs are stored in browser cookies placed on the internet browser associated with the device you are using to surf the web.
==========
Examples of commonly used internet browsers include Microsoft Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
Our KME cookie consists of a random combination of letters and numbers, but is unique to the browser on your device.
The KME cookie allows us to identify your browser the next time you are visiting a web site that uses our Services.
For more information about our KME cookie and other cookies we use, please see our Platform Services Cookie Policy.
Device IDs.
In the case of mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, etc.), some mobile inventory suppliers and third-party service providers that we work with may provide us with the device ID assigned to your device (i.e., a Google AdID for Android devices or an Apple IDFA for Apple devices).
==========
Internet Protocol Address (“IP address”).
IP addresses are assigned by your Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast/Xfinity, AT&T, British Telecom, Virgin Media, Sky Broadband, Orange, etc.) to the modem used to access the Internet for connected devices in your home and/or business.
Any devices using the modem to access the Internet may broadcast the same IP address.
==========
At home, connected devices could include one or more laptop/desktop computers, tablets, mobile phones, smart/connected TVs and gaming consoles.
At work, connected devices could include one (or all) floor(s) in an office building.
HTTP headers & User Agent.
When a client sends Konduit an ad request, we receive certain information about the source of the request, such as the publisher client (web site) sending the request and data associated with the source device’s Internet browser/content delivery software (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or a smart/connected TV or gaming console’s browser).
We may also receive information such as device type (e.g., computer, tablet, smart/connected TV), date/time of visit and/or browser type.
==========
Click-stream Data.
Click-stream data includes web pages you visited when viewing an ad we’ve sent in response to an ad call we received, and information on your interaction with the Services when viewing content on your device’s Internet browser, including whether you interacted with the ad (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what ad content you viewed (i.e., which ad we delivered to you).
Geographic Location Information.
We may potentially receive geographic location information (i.e., information that determines with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of a person or device, such as GPS level latitude-longitude coordinates or location based Wi-Fi triangulation) from an ad call to our systems.
How do we collect?
==========
Konduit.me is an advertising technology company that works with other commercial businesses to optimize and accelerate the delivery of digital video ads.
As such, Konduit.me receives information through the various publishers, platforms, advertisers, and other third-party service providers that are involved in the ad serving process through both cookie and non-cookie technology.
Konduit.me only collects relevant and necessary information to perform its Services and where Konduit.me has a lawful basis to do so.
Konduit.me can receive your information from any part of the ad serving process, from when an ad call is initiated to when the call is sent out to other platforms or third-party service providers.
The information sent to us is outlined above in the section, “What do we collect?”
.
Since Konduit.me is rarely the primary collection point for data, we rely on the various publishers, platforms, advertisers, and third-party service providers that collect the information to pass on privacy information and opt-out flags.
Those utilizing our technology may use their own tags, pixels, cookies, and other similar technology within their advertisements.
We are not responsible for their use of such tracking technologies or for their privacy practices.
==========
Konduit.me follows the following process to identify when to collect and when to not collect your data:

If you are visiting a web site or utilizing a platform that leverages our Services, Konduit.me will observe the sent ad request.
If an opt-out flag has been checked, Konduit.me processes, preserves, and passes on the ad request with the opt-out flag and then purges the data from its Services immediately after the ad call completes.
If an opt-out flag has not been checked, Konduit.me will check its own existing opt-out requests to see if you have opted-out of Konduit.me Services directly from Konduit.me (which you can do by clicking here).
==========
If you have opted-out of Konduit.me Services, Konduit.me processes, preserves, and passes on the ad request adding the opt-out flag and then purges the data from its Services immediately after the ad call completes.
If you have not opted-out of Konduit.me Services, Konduit.me processes, preserve, and passes on the ad request.
Then, information necessary to improving Konduit.me’s Services will be stored.
