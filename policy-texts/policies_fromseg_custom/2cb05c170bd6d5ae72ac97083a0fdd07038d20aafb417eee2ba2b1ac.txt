Internet Users - Cookies, Internet Protocol (IP) Address, Aggregate Information  - (Top)

Cookies - In addition to Personal Information, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain web pages to help analyze our web page flow and measure promotional effectiveness.
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.
This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site and services.
A few important things you should know about cookies are that:

We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
.
==========
We use cookies to better your web experience.
Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted 
                                                    from your hard drive at the end of a session.
You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control.
(For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)
Disabling/enabling cookies - You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.
However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.
==========
Web Beacon - Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF.
We use pixels tags or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising and promotions.
These tags collect anonymous (not personally identifiable) information about which advertisements and promotions bring users to our website.
With both cookie and tag technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
==========
Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail.
When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values.
Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a site.
A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site.
Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity.
The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.
==========

DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the DAA opt-out link above.
However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)
 - (Top)

A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its Privacy Statement) a policy of not disclosing customer's Personal Information to third parties for their direct 
                                                marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.
Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
