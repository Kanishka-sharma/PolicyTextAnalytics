==========
Legal basis for processing your Personal Data  
When we use your Personal Data, we take care to ensure that it is used in an appropriate way.
Use of Personal Data under European data protection law must be based on one of a number of legal grounds as set out below.
We will use your Personal Data and share that Personal Data where:

Its use is necessary in relation to our Services or contract you have entered into or because you have asked for something to be done so you can enter into a contract with us.
Its use is necessary because of a legal obligation that applies to us (except an obligation imposed by a contract).
This may include responding to subpoenas, warrants or other requests served on New Relic anywhere in the world or to protect or defend the rights or property of New Relic or its users.
==========
You have consented to its use in a specific way.
For example where you have consented to receiving marketing materials.
You may withdraw your consent at any time as further described in Section 9 (Your choices and data protection rights).
==========
Its use is necessary to protect your vital interests.
This will only arise in exceptional circumstances where we will use and/or disclose information about you to identify, locate and protect you if requested by a regulatory authority.
Its use is in accordance with our legitimate interests e.g. to manage our business, subject to those interests not overriding your fundamental rights and freedoms.
==========
This may include monitoring and administering our Site, corresponding with you in connection with our Services, research and development purposes, participating in partnership agreements or for the purposes of detecting and preventing illegal activities.
We may also need to transfer some or all of your Personal Data to a third party or their advisors in connection with a sale, merger or reorganisation of our business.
We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests as part of any due diligence process for the purpose of analysing the proposed sale or reorganisation or after the sale or reorganisation for the same purposes as set out in this notice.
==========
If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” section below.
6.
Profiling
In connection with our marketing activities, we analyze some of the information that we collect about our customers to determine what offers are more likely to be of interest to different categories of customers in different circumstances and at different times.
==========
We call this the creation of “segments”.
From time to time, we will assess the Personal Data that we hold about you in order to assign you to a particular segment.
We may use the segment that you have been assigned to in order to tailor our marketing communications to include offers and content that are relevant to you.
==========
We may also use this method to avoid sending you offers that are unlikely to be of interest to you.
For example, if you are based in the EEA we can use your information to communicate with you about Services that we consider are relevant to you, in accordance with your marketing preferences.
7.
==========
How long we hold your Personal Data
We retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
This may also include situations where litigation is pending or ongoing and such information is subject to a legal hold.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the retention of your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to Contact Us” Section below.
8.
==========
International Data Transfers
Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
Specifically, if you are located in the EEA, you should note that your Personal Data will be accessed by New Relic staff or suppliers, transferred, and/or stored outside the EEA, including to the US and other countries which have different data protection laws.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this General Privacy Notice.
These include implementing an adequate method of transfer, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield, for transfers of Personal Data with our third party service providers and partners, further details of which can be provided upon request.

==========
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting.
New Relic does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
New Relic takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.
11.
