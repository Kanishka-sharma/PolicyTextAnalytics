Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, or take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform the Services.

Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
==========
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12 month period.
The verifiable consumer request must: 

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person we collected personal information on.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
==========
Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to verifiable consumer requests within 45 days of receipt.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to you by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.
If applicable, we will also provide reasons we cannot comply with your request.
==========
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded.

==========
Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information (the “right to opt-out”).

Consumers may opt-out of future sales at any time.

Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

Deny you goods or services.
