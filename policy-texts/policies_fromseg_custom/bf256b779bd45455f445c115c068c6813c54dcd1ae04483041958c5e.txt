Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor" in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.
The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.
This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.
The sensor does not collect or use any other information.
If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor


Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us
