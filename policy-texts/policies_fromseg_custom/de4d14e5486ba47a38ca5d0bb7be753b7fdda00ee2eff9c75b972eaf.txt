==========
The Non-PII information we receive from you and/or through your use of the Service will be used to tailor your experience on the Application, including showing you content we think you might be interested in, recommendations of Sites to follow, and advertising, and may also be shared with advertisers and other third parties, including business partners such as advertising businesses who are obligated to comply with applicable laws concerning usage of the information, as well as our corporate affiliates, in connection with the Service (such third parties and affiliates collectively, "Affiliates").

==========
USE OF COOKIES, BEACONS, AND PIXEL TAGS
When you use the Website we might store some information on your computer.
This information may be in the form of a "cookie", "web beacon", or similar file.
"Cookies" are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on Websites.
"Web Beacons" are invisible electronic images, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a Cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web Beacon is placed.
We use Cookies to deliver content and/or advertising specific to your interests, and to enable you to log into the Service without having to reenter all of your information.
In addition, we may use an outside advertisement server company to display ads on the Website or Application.
==========
These ads may contain Cookies.
The advertisement server company may collect Cookies received with outside banner ads.
We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of Cookies by the advertisement server company.
You can learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at www.aboutcookies.org.
==========
We may allow third parties to collect the anonymous data received from Cookies and Web Beacons on our behalf, and to retain and use this data themselves.
In addition, we may share this anonymous data with other third parties.
To protect your privacy, we do not use Cookies or Web Beacons to store or transmit any PII about you.
==========
You have the ability to accept or decline Cookies.
Most web browsers and mobile devices automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s or mobile device’s setting to decline Cookies if you prefer.
If you choose to decline Cookies, certain features of the Service may not function properly or not at all.
You may render some Web Beacons unusable by rejecting their associated Cookies.
From time to time, we may also place Cookies and Web Beacons on your computer or mobile device to collect anonymous data related to your use of our Website and your use of the Application, including Service usage analytics.
ANALYTICS SERVICE PROVIDERS
We may allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include Web Beacons within the pages of our Website and anonymous identifiers on the Application.
==========
We may also share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, with these service providers for analytics purposes.
These service providers aggregate information about what you see and interact with on our Website and on the Application.
These service providers offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective Websites.
We allow Web Beacons from and share log file data with these service providers.
To obtain a list of these service providers in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at privacy@tapatalk.com.

==========
ADVERTISEMENTS; AD NETWORKS; OTHER THIRD PARTIES
We may allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of the Service.
Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include Cookies and Web Beacons within our Website, or other tracking methodologies such as anonymous device identifiers on the Website and/or Application to collect anonymous information in order to provide customized content and/or ads, auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and advertisers when you visit certain pages of the Website or Application, and other websites or applications.
For example, because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party’s web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own Cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their website directly.
When you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that these companies will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements.
==========
In addition, we or a data partner we have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use the Service or other websites or applications, or to seek to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers.
In order to customize these ads or content, we or our data partner may connect de-identified demographic or other data about you (received from third parties) either to data you voluntarily submitted to us (such as your email address), or to data passively collected from you (such as your device identifier or IP address).
However, we will only share your email address with our data partners in hashed, non-human readable form.
The above third-party companies offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites.
To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at privacy@tapatalk.com.
==========
You can also learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out capabilities at the Network Advertising Initiative Website or the Digital Advertising Alliance Website.
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.
If you use the Service after opting out, you will continue to receive generic advertisements.
LINKS
The Service may contain links to websites or applications not operated by Tapatalk.
The Service may also carry advertisements from third party companies not associated with Tapatalk.
Tapatalk is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or applications or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Service or for the privacy practices of third party advertising companies.
Once you leave the Service via a link, access a website, a third party application or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the website or application to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.
WIDGETS
We may include a widget from a third party on the Website or Application that allows interaction or content sharing by users.
"Widgets" are mini-programs (such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button) that provide specific services or content from a third party.
The third party providing the Widget may offer controls for you to manage the Widget’s appearance and functionality.
==========
Your interaction with a Widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through the third party’s Cookies or its registration information.
In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its Widgets and Cookies even when you do not interact with the Widget.
To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at privacy@tapatalk.com.
==========
DO NOT TRACK
Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers.
Tapatalk honors DNT settings in your browser, but will override such setting in the event that you turn on the “Remember Me” feature in the Service settings.
If you want Tapatalk to fully honor DNT settings from your browser, visit settings and turn the “Remember Me” feature to the “Off” position.
==========
SECURITY
Tapatalk uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures designed to safeguard PII in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.
In addition, Tapatalk uses reasonable methods in an effort to make sure that the PII we store about you is consistent with the updated information you provide to us.
