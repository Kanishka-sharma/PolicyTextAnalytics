How ADACADO Technology processes information related to ads you see
Using cookies and web beacons, ADACADO Technologies saves information inside a cookie on a device associated with your browser.
Inside the cookie is a simple, unique visitor identifier.
Note that uniquely-identifying information about you such as your name, address or, email address is never used or saved.
==========
ADACADO uses this visitor identifier to associate your browsing history and information about ADACADO advertisements you have seen.
Browsing history is information about how you may interact with an advertiser’s website.
For example, if you were interested in and displayed one or more products over time, or visited a category page describing a grouping of an advertiser’s products, ADACADO would record that information.
ADACADO also records advertisement delivery history which is when what what advertisements were delivered to you, and whether and on what elements of the advertisements you clicked (e.g., clicking the advertisement or clicking next and previous).
When ADACADO Technologies receives a request to deliver an advertisement, it may use the above information to deliver an interest-based advertisement.
However, if consent is not provided (for consent-requiring jurisdictions), or you have opted out of ADACADO advertising, you will not be delivered an interest-based ad.
In such cases you will receive a generic ad that is not based on any information related to you.
ADACADO’s only connection to you is through your visitor identifier.
It describes no information about you and is used solely as a link to browsing history and advertisement delivery history.
By exercising your rights to your information as described in an earlier section of this document, your visitor identifier is deleted, thereby severing the link to our data and making it anonymous.
Data ADACADO collects and uses
We collect data related to your browsing activity and advertisements delivered to you through cookies or visitor id-based transactions that record:

events related to your activity on our advertising partner’s website such as the products you viewed or areas such as category pages.
events regarding your ad serving activity such as the advertisements that were displayed to you and how you interacted with them such as clicks and next/previous events.
==========
information related to your device such as device type, operating system, version but no personally identified information.
non-precise geo-location information that may identify you as being in a country, region or city, for example to serve only advertisements for products that are only locally available to you.
==========
For consent-requiring jurisdictions, we do not use or save IP addresses unless your explicit consent is provided.
