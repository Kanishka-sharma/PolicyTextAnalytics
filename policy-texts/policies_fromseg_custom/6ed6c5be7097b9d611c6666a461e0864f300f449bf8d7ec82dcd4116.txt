This Site is hosted in the United States by DigitalOcean, a company headquartered in New York, New York, USA.
This Privacy Policy explains our practices for gathering and disseminating information we collect when you visit our Site and associated web pages.

However, we may track the technical information (see "Information Collected Using Cookies" below) provided to us by your browsing the Site to improve the navigation, content and design of our Site.
==========
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, online resources to which this Site may link, frame or otherwise reference (collectively "Third Party Services") that you may access through the Services.
We take no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of those Third Party Services.
We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
==========
What Information Do We Collect And Why?
The information we gather aides us to personalize, improve and operate the Services.
You may voluntarily provide additional information about yourself to enable us to provide the information or Services you are requesting.
We store the information you provide about yourself in order to provide you with the information or Services you request.
Such information, with the exception of any Personal Information, is typically stored for the lifetime of the database unless you request that it be removed.
The information you provide us about yourself will be shared with our employees or contractors to the extent necessary to accommodate your request.
We will obtain your consent in order for us to share your Personal Information with third parties in a manner that is not permitted under the terms of this Privacy Policy.
==========
Unless otherwise described below, we will not use Personal Information provided to us online for purposes other than those you have requested without also providing you an opportunity to agree to or otherwise limit such uses.
We may collect the following types of information from our users, some of which will be Personal Information and some of which will not be Personal Information.
User Content and Account Information:
Some features of the Services may allow you to provide content to the Services that is not Personal Information.
All such content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us as long as necessary according to the applicable law, even after you terminate your Account.
==========
We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in an anonymized manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
As part of your Account information, DigitalOcean collects and stores information, including the full name, company name, billing address, email address, IP address, landing page, and referring URL, for all users upon registration and use of the Services.
You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow us, our affiliates, our service providers and our contractors to identify you and, therefore, your use of the Services may not be anonymous.

==========
If you are a resident of the EU/EEA or Switzerland, the rules of the privacy shield limit such access and we fully abide by the privacy shield rules in this case.
Wherever we are required to transfer your Personal Information, regardless of where this occurs, we will strive to take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We collect and use this information to improve our customer service.
Financial Information:
We use third party payment processing companies ("Payment Processors") who collect and store financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information), and their use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processors' applicable terms of service and privacy policy.
Collected billing information is used for the purposes of processing billing payments and fraud detection.
==========
IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:
We may automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address.
An IP address is a number assigned to you by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet.
We receive IP addresses in the normal course of the operation of our Site.
==========
We may automatically collect and record information about your use of features of our Services, about the functionality of our Services, and other information related to your interactions with the Services.
We use the information we automatically collect and record to analyze trends, to administer, monitor and improve the Site and Services, to track users' use of the Site and Services, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We do not use IP addresses to identify you personally or disclose them to others.
This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).
Generally, the Services may automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site.
We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.
==========
Information Collected from Droplets:
As one of our many Services, we provide a Droplet feature, which is a virtual private server.
You can enable certain enhanced monitoring metrics on your Droplet by installing software automatically when you create your Droplet by selecting Monitoring on your cloud console or API, or by installing the software on your Droplet manually at any time.
More information can be found in our Monitoring guide.
==========
This monitoring software collects information about CPU, disk, bandwidth, and memory usage as well as other system-level data and metrics about processes and services that run on your Droplet.
You can use this data about your Droplet to view metrics and track performance of your Droplet.
We may use data gathered from the Droplets to help us improve our products and services and to develop future products and services.
We may use Aggregate Information (as defined below) collected from Droplets for marketing purposes.
==========
If the “Monitoring” check box is selected, then the monitoring software will be installed by default on your Droplet.
If you do not wish to install this monitoring software on your Droplet, make sure that the monitoring checkbox is not checked during the creation of the Droplet, or specify it accordingly in the API.
Droplet monitoring preferences can only be modified by the person/entity that created and otherwise controls the Droplet.
You can uninstall this monitoring software from your Droplet at any time by removing the package using the native package manager.
