Information Collected Online
Most of the information provided by The Weather Channel is offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you.
For instance, you can view weather conditions in your hometown or anywhere in the world without giving out any personally identifiable information.
In order to maximize your experience and to provide you with enhanced products and services, however, The Weather Channel collects personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) and demographic data (e.g., zip code, gender, birth date, interests, etc.) that you voluntarily supply to us.

Some examples of instances when we collect personally identifiable information include when you:

Thus, you have a choice as to whether to provide your personally identifiable information.
Although you are not required to disclose any personally identifiable information to us, portions of our Web site and other specialized services may be unavailable to you without such information.
In the case of participation in a chat session you are not required to provide any personally identifiable information.
However, we do require you to select a user name.
Also, the sessions are monitored and transcripts are posted on the Web site for access by other users.
How We Use Your Information
We use the information you provide in a limited number of ways.
We may use the information to service your account, conduct a transaction that you have requested, display information and advertisements that match your interests and profile, notify you if you've won a contest or sweepstakes and compile demographic statistics about our users.
We may on occasion combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from other parties to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you.

How We Share Your Information
One of the most valuable assets of our business is you.
The Weather Channel does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except as described below.
weather.com and its Affiliates
We provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive special offers from weather.com and it affiliates.

Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services
In two types of instances, we provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive promotions, products or services from third party sponsors: 1) only with your permission, The Weather Channel will periodically send to you, via e-mail, offers and promotions from our third party sponsors which we select based upon your interests or user profile.
In these instances, we do not share your personally identifiable information with the third party sponsors-we do the mailing for them.
Additionally, you will always have the opportunity, with each e-mail, to opt-out of receiving future offers.
2) In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services from specifically identified third parties directly through our site.
In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer.

All information provided to third parties is governed by the Privacy Policies of these third parties.
We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and you should review the Privacy Policies of these parties before supplying personally identifiable information to them.
Third-Party Processors
When you submit your personal information on the weather.com Web site, it may be shared with a reputable third party ("Third Party Processors").
==========
These Third Party Processors may include, for example, companies that operate our online store and companies that process credit card information or handle shipping for The Weather Channel.

The Privacy Policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information.

The Weather Channel continually looks for ways to improve our business.
One such way of improving our business might be to buy or sell a company.
If we buy or sell a business, databases containing personally identifiable information will likely be transferred as part of the sale.
If we buy a business, we will honor the requests of that business' former customers regarding their personally identifiable information.
