Privacy Policy
Welcome to AddThis.com, a website owned and controlled by AddThis, Inc. ("AddThis", "we", "us", or "our").

We provide this privacy policy to let you know what information we collect, how we use it, share it and protect it.
Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to the website located at www.addthis.com (the "Site"), the tools and interactive forums made available through the Site and the AddThis sharing platform, as well as a number of related services (collectively the "Services").
As a general rule there are two categories of users of the Site and Services: "Publishers" who are operators or publishers of websites that make the AddThis sharing platform available on their website, and "End Users" who are individual visitors of a website and use the AddThis sharing platform to share a website's content with others.
By visiting the Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

If you prefer that we do not collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may opt out.

Privacy Practices for End Users who use the AddThis Sharing Button on Publisher Websites
As part of the Service, we operate the AddThis sharing platform, which makes sharing content on the web easy.
If you are reading this policy, you are probably familiar with our buttons and menus that Publishers enable on their websites to allow you to share their content through email, social networking websites, blogs and more.
When you, an End User use one of our buttons, menus and/or toolboxes that is enabled on one of our Publisher websites (an "AddThis Button"), we collect certain non-personally identifiable information automatically for use on our platform (the "AddThis Platform").
We enable our Publishers to use this information via the Platform for analytics purposes, and we also use some of this information for online ad targeting as described below.
==========
(a) The Information We Gather and How We Use It:
Personal Information — We only collect Personal Information via an AddThis Button when an End User provides it to us, and never use that information on the AddThis Platform for delivering targeted advertising.
When you, an End User, send an email using an AddThis Button we use your email address, the email address of the person (or people) to whom you are sending the content and allow you the opportunity to write an accompanying message.
We use this Personal Information only to send the email on your behalf and for no other purpose, and it is not merged or otherwise combined with any of the Non-Personally Identifiable Information that we collect.
This Personal Information will be available to the people to whom you send or share content via the AddThis Button, so please be careful.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information — We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information via the AddThis Button for use on the AddThis Platform.
For example, when you visit a web page that contains one of our AddThis Buttons, our server logs collect your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time you visited that web page, and (if you came to a web page where an AddThis Button is enabled via a search engine such as Google), the web search that landed you on that web page.
We also collect information regarding how often you share content with others using the AddThis platform.
We use this information to help us build commercially viable data segments (e.g., travel enthusiast, sports fan) for online ad targeting in order to help make the ads you see on many of the websites you visit more relevant to your interests, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
For information regarding how we use this information to help deliver more relevant advertising please see the section below entitled "Targeted Advertising and Choices."
==========
We also set Cookies and web beacons on web pages where our AddThis Buttons are enabled, and allow our partners to set Cookies and web beacons that are subject to those partners' privacy statements.
We also use this information to customize the AddThis Button to your usage patterns.
For example, if you share to Facebook, we make sure that Facebook icon is at the top of your AddThis Button menu.
==========
(b) Information Sharing.
We generally don't share Personal Information collected via the AddThis Button except as specifically directed by the End User in order to share a piece of content via email or via social networking platform.
We share information collected via the AddThis Button with other companies or individuals as follows:
We share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with partners and the website Publishers who have the AddThis Button enabled on their websites for analytics and other business purposes.
For example, we provide our publishers with statistics on sharing trends, and the top content segments shared (e.g., A blog post analyzing a speech given by the President), so that Publishers can understand how End Users are sharing their content, as well as how much web traffic such sharing brings back to the Publisher's site.
Publishers may use this information to tailor content and advertising on individual publisher sites.
Publishers can use filters to refine the data by domain, time period, geography, and other options.
We share any information with third parties if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or an enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce the applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of AddThis, its End Users or the public as required or permitted by law.
We share information with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us, in which case we will require them to honor this policy.
Additionally, in the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we expect that any and all information that we have will be among the assets transferred.
==========
In addition, we may aggregate your Non-Personally Identifiable Information with the Non-Personally Identifiable Information of others and share that aggregated information with third parties without restriction.
(c) Targeted Advertising and Choices
We don't use Personal Information to serve targeted advertising via the Platform.
Most of our Services are available to End Users and Publishers at no cost.
To support our Services, we license or otherwise provide the Non-Personally Identifiable Information we collect via many of the AddThis Buttons enabled on Publisher websites and use that information via the Platform to deliver or enable the delivery of advertising that is customized to End User interests.
We also set Cookies and web beacons on web pages where our AddThis Buttons are enabled to help us with online ad targeting and to provide analytics to our website Publishers.
If you prefer that we do not collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may opt out.
==========
When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.
The opt-out cookie tells us not to use your information for delivering relevant online advertisements.
Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly.
Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
We also allow our partners to set cookies and web beacons via certain AddThis Buttons.
==========
Some of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).
For more information, please visit the NAI website at Network Advertising Initiative.
(d) Health and Finance Data
We abide by the NAI and DAA Codes in the US, EU and Canada, which restrict the collection and use of health and finance data for online advertising.
==========
We do not use or share with third parties any health-related or finance-related data that we consider sensitive.
We recognize that others may have differing views regarding which categories of health and finance data are sensitive.
The types of health information we utilize may be found by clicking here.
The types of finance information we utilize may be found by clicking here.
==========
While we do not consider any of these data categories to be sensitive, it is important to provide this transparency to help you have a better idea of what data might be collected by us, so that you can make informed decisions.
Privacy Practices for End Users Who Download and Use AddThis Toolbars
In addition to the AddThis Buttons that appear on Publisher websites, we offer toolbars (our "Toolbar") that can be downloaded by End Users, installed as a plug-in on the End User's browser and used to share content from virtually any website.
We do not target advertising based upon information collected through any Toolbar.
When an End User uses the Toolbar, we collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information about the End User's usage of the Toolbar, including whether the End User downloads and installs the Toolbar, how and when the End User utilizes the Toolbar and when the End User uninstalls the Toolbar.
We use this information to understand how the Toolbar is being used, and to help us ensure that our Toolbars are functioning properly.
We also collect but do not store the keyword searches that each End User executes via the Toolbar.
We collect the keyword searches in order to provide them to the search engine indicated in the Toolbar (e.g., Yahoo!), and such search engine's use of the keywords is governed by its own privacy policy.
==========
Information Security, Retention, and Data Integrity
We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
These include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict access to Personal Information to AddThis employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services.
These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations.
However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.
==========
We retain Non-Personally Identifiable Information on the Platform for up to five years.
Any search strings we collect via the AddThis Button are converted into Non-Personally Identifiable Information, and the raw search data is stored on our server logs for up to 90 days.
Aggregate reports generated from such information may be kept longer.
==========
AddThis processes information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
Access
AddThis will allow an individual access to their Personal Information to the extent it is available and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
If you have provided Personal Information when registering for our Site, you may access and modify that information at any time by visiting your account settings.
If you'd like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any other Personal Information that you have provided to us, please send your request to us at euprivacy@addthis.com and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.
Children
We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services are designed to attract people under the age of 13.
Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.
If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases.
==========
Links to Other Sites
Our Site and Services contain links to, and allow you to share content on, third party websites and services.
The fact that we link to a website or service or allow you to share content on them is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
This privacy policy applies only as provided in the scope section above.
Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Additionally, you understand that your Personal Information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing Personal Information may be less stringent than in your country.
