Do-Not-Track
There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity.
One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you.
This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal.
Please note that our websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from Web browsers.
At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected.
In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.
