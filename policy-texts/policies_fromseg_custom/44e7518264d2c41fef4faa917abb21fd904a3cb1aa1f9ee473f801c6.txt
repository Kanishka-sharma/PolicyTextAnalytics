The SunTrust Privacy Policy
Protecting the Confidentiality of Our Clients' Information
Effective December 2005
At SunTrust, we recognize the sensitive nature of your financial information and take appropriate precautions to protect your privacy.
When you entrust us with this information, you can be certain it will be used only within our strict guidelines:
We do not sell, rent or trade any client information to other companies
Within SunTrust, we safeguard your information carefully and provide you with the flexibility to dictate how it may be used
We are committed to helping you protect your privacy every day
SunTrust is required to provide our clients with a document illustrating the types of information we collect and the circumstances under which we may share it.
This brochure describes those practices for all members of the SunTrust corporate family, including Alexander Key Investments and Asset Management Advisors, LLC.
For a complete listing of the firms in the SunTrust Banks, Inc. corporate family, please see the About SunTrust section of our Web site.
This policy statement takes the place of any previous privacy policies issued by SunTrust Banks, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries.
==========
If, in addition to federal law, you are protected by specific state or local regulations concerning information sharing and marketing, SunTrust will fully comply with those regulations as well.
We hope you will read through all the details of SunTrust's official position on privacy.
SunTrust uses information responsibly to provide you with the services you've requested; offer you other financial products and services; and make doing business with SunTrust more convenient for you.
==========
The Kinds of Information We Collect
If you apply for a loan or a new account: We ask you to provide information about your financial status, such as employment, income, monthly expenses and assets, as well as identifying information, such as your address, telephone number, and Social Security number.
In most cases, you give us this information yourself, in person, by mail, or through a Web site.
If we need to know about your credit and repayment history, we also obtain information from consumer reporting agencies and other creditors.
If you apply for insurance: We ask you to provide information relevant to underwriting the specific insurance product.
This information, such as your health or driving record, is not used for any purpose other than to provide the service and insurance applied for.
Once you become a client: We maintain information about your transactions including account balances, securities holdings, and repayment history.
==========
Because it's important to know what types of services may be most valuable to you, we obtain statistics and demographic information about current and prospective clients from marketing information firms.
How We Use This Information
The information we collect is used to help us deliver the services you've requested.
It may also permit us to design and offer specific products and services that we believe will be useful to you and other clients.
==========
Who Has Access to This Information?
Within SunTrust
SunTrust employees are permitted access to the information they need to perform their jobs on your behalf.
We maintain strict internal policies against unauthorized disclosure or use of client information by employees.
==========
SunTrust has a number of subsidiaries offering a wide variety of services, such as mortgage banking, securities brokerage, insurance sales, leasing, consumer finance, and many others.
As permitted by law, information held by any SunTrust subsidiary is available to other members of the SunTrust corporate family for authorized purposes, unless a client has specifically requested otherwise.
(See "How to Limit Information Sharing and Marketing.")
SunTrust Credit Cards
In order to offer credit cards to our clients, SunTrust partners with an external card issuer to offer, endorse, and sponsor the SunTrust credit card.
Currently, SunTrust and MBNA America Bank, N.A. (which is not a SunTrust affiliate) have a joint marketing agreement.
SunTrust may engage another card issuer in similar fashion without further notice.
==========
In order to offer credit cards to our clients, it is important that we exchange certain client information with the card issuer.
This may include:
Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, Social Security number, assets or income
Information about your transactions with SunTrust, such as your account balance or payment history
Information obtained from specialized marketing information firms, such as household statistics
Information from credit bureaus regarding your previous credit performance
The card issuer has agreed to strictly safeguard the confidentiality of this client information and they are not permitted to share it with anyone else without our permission.
Clients may request that SunTrust not share their information with the card issuer.
==========
(See "How to Limit Information Sharing and Marketing.")
If you elect to obtain a SunTrust credit card, please familiarize yourself with the card issuer's privacy policy as it may differ from the SunTrust policy.
Companies That You Ask Us to Share With
From time to time, we will make available the services of other financial firms, such as homeowner's insurance coverage for SunTrust mortgage applicants.
In these cases, SunTrust will get your permission prior to sharing your information with the outside firm.
SunTrust may get your written, online, or verbal permission to share your information.
If you grant permission, it will apply only to the specific program or programs you consent to.
If you have previously requested that we block the sharing of your information, that request will remain in place for all other situations.
==========
Outside Service Providers
We have arrangements with companies whose experience is essential for our own services to operate properly.
For example, we work with firms that execute securities transactions, enable Online Banking, and make account statements possible for SunTrust clients.
These companies work at SunTrust's direction and only the client information necessary for them to perform these functions is shared.
They are required to safeguard your information and only use it for authorized purposes, and within the guidelines established by SunTrust for the protection of client information.
Consumer Reporting Agencies (Credit Bureaus)
It is standard banking industry practice and within federal and state law for SunTrust to routinely provide data about client loan repayment and transactions to these agencies and other creditors.
We may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus.
Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account(s) may be reflected in your credit report.
==========
Courts and Government Bodies
Certain federal and state laws may require us to share information about you.
For example, if you are involved in a legal matter with a third party, we may be ordered to provide information to a court or other party.
In these circumstances, only the specific information required by law, subpoena, or court order will be shared.
==========
Former Clients
We may share information about former clients with SunTrust affiliates, marketing partners, and other third parties as described above.
However, former clients can also elect not to have their information shared, even after their relationship with us ends.
How to Limit Information Sharing and Marketing
If you prefer, you may direct us not to share personal information about you that isn't publicly available such as your income, account history, and credit score with our affiliates (and our card issuer).
This is commonly known as "opting-out" of information sharing.
==========
There are several ways to opt-out:
You can write to us at:
SunTrust Privacy Preferences
P.O. Box 4418
Mail Code 5027
Atlanta, GA 30302
Please include your name, address (including zip code), telephone number, and the last six digits of your Social Security number with the request.
Incomplete information will delay, or possibly prevent, our ability to honor your request.
You can fax your request listing this same information to:
(678) 284-7085, Attn: Privacy
You can visit your nearest branch and speak with a client service representative
You can call anytime toll free to our automated Client Privacy Request line at 800.432.9472
Or you can go to the Privacy section of our Web site and opt-out via our secure online form
By selecting "No Share" status, you restrict the use of your personal information in any marketing activities conducted by our affiliates.
This exclusion does not apply, however, to any affiliates with which you currently do business or if you ask to receive information or offers from them.
==========
If you are interested in restricting all marketing you receive from SunTrust, please request "No Direct Mail" and/or "No Telemarketing."
By making these choices, you are directing SunTrust to remove you from lists used for direct mail and telephone solicitations.
These offers are from SunTrust (with the exception of those from the card issuer) and usually include enhanced services and special offers.
Once you make either selection ("No Direct Mail" and/or "No Telemarketing"), your name will be removed from these lists and you will no longer receive SunTrust solicitations in this manner.
An opt-out request is processed within 30 days of receipt.
Even if you elect not to have information shared or used for marketing, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other laws allow us to share specific details about your transactions and experience with us.
The use of this information is limited by federal law to specific permissible purposes, such as applications for credit, insurance or employment.
==========
If you have already submitted a request to opt-out of information sharing and marketing, there is no need to opt-out again.
This designation is permanent and can only be removed with a written client request.
This also applies if you've previously requested "No Direct Mail" and/or "No Telemarketing" status.
If you have opted-out in the past and now wish to opt-in – or remove the opt-out flag from your records – please write us.
==========
How We Protect Your Privacy Online
There may be instances where SunTrust needs to treat your information differently than described in this policy when doing business with you online.
In these cases, we will provide you with a clear, plain-language disclosure and obtain your authorization before proceeding.
The authorization may come in the form of clicking on a disclosure, replying to an email, or enrolling in specialized online services.
SunTrust will always protect your privacy in a manner that is consistent with the principles outlined in this policy.
For more complete details of SunTrust's online information practices, including specific examples and an overview of our security measures, please visit our Privacy and Secuity section.
==========
How SunTrust Uses Email
SunTrust will never send emails asking for personal or account information, such as passwords, Social Security numbers, PINs, credit or check card numbers.
In most instances, we will not send you emails unless you have initiated an email dialogue with us; you have previously requested us to communicate with you in this manner; and/or the email is about your relationship with the bank.
We will send you marketing emails only if you have given us your express consent to receive this type of information.
Fraudulent emails and Web sites can appear to be from legitimate companies and include their images and logos.
They often have a sense of urgency about them and state that if you fail to update or confirm certain information, access to your accounts will be suspended.
==========
These emails are not authorized by SunTrust and are fraudulent.
To report a fraudulent email or Web site please call us at 800.382.3232 or send an email to .

If you want to stop these calls as well, please request "No Telemarketing" status directly from SunTrust.
==========
Protect Yourself
The most effective privacy policy is the precautions you take to guard against the disclosure and unauthorized use of your account and personal information:
Never provide personal information (including Social Security numbers or account and credit card information) over the phone unless you have initiated the call and know with whom you are speaking.
Safeguard checks, account statements and ATM, credit and debit cards.
Report any lost or stolen items immediately.
Memorize personal identification numbers (PINs) and avoid writing PINs, Social Security numbers or credit card account numbers where they can be easily found.
Destroy any preapproved credit offers that you don't intend to respond to.
