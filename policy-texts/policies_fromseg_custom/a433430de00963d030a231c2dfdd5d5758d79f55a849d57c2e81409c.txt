Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are a standard feature of websites that allow us to store small amounts of data on your computer about your use of our Websites.
A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive.
It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally.
Cookies have the ability to store information about web pages viewed and the advertisements viewed or clicked.
For registered customers, cookies can also save user information and screen preferences.
==========
A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Websites but not on your computer.
When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit.
They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular device visits a particular page.
If you turn off cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
Prudential uses cookies and pixel tags to provide better customer service, and to analyze how visitors use and navigate our Websites and identify areas which may need improvement.
Cookies also help us enhance navigation and the functionality of our Websites, to securely maintain a session for existing clients accessing password-protected areas, and to personalize aspects of a visitor's experience.
We collect information from cookies and pixel tags to evaluate responses to surveys and our advertisements on other websites and to provide you with specific or relevant content such as articles and educational material when you visit our Websites.
Some of our Websites use cookies to better serve you when you return to the website.
For example, a cookie may remember your user ID to simplify your login to a password-protected page.
