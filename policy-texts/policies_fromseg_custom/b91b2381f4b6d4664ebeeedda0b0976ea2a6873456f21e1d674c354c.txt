How to Limit Collection of Mobile Data.

The NAI maintains a guide showing how to opt out on a variety of mobile devices: http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice.
Note the following when using the opt-out mechanisms below: If you use multiple devices we will opt out those devices that we have linked to the email address or the mobile device ID that you provide when opting out.
Since we may not have all your browsers or devices connected back to your user, you may need to execute this opt-out on each browser or device.
Other companies’ opt-outs may function differently than our opt-out mechanism.
