Children
On the sites specifically designed for children, Spirit requires children to consult with their parents before furnishing data.
However, Spirit believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that may help provide a child-friendly online environment.
These tools may also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.
Personal information about or obtained from a child will not be used for commercial or trade purposes without the prior written consent of a parent or legal guardian of the child.

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Spirit under confidentiality agreements.
These companies may use your personal information to help Spirit communicate with you about offers from Spirit and our marketing partners.
However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13.
Parents have the option of allowing Spirit to collect and use their child's information without consenting to Spirit sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
