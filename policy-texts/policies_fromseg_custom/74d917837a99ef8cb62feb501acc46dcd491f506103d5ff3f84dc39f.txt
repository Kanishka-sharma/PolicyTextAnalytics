Our site contains links to other sites that may request

==========
How Do We Protect Your Information?
We have strict security 

              procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information 

              in order to prevent unauthorized access to comply with the UK Data 

              Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998.
==========
Cookies & IP Addresses
		 
            A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's 

              hard drive by your web browser.
It acts as an anonymous identifier 

              when you visit our site.
We use this information to create anonymous 

              usage and interest profiles.
This information never includes any 

              information that would identify you personally, nor does it include 

              any information that would be considered sensitive.
==========
Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can 

              alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance.
If you choose not to receive cookies, you may still use most of 

              the features of our web site.
==========
Multimap.com also uses IP addresses to administer our Web site 

              and gather traffic data.
Your IP address may be used to gather broad 

              demographic information; however, your address is not used in any 

              way that would identify you personally.
Surveys
                    Multimap.com runs online surveys that ask respondents for 
                    contact information and demographic details, such as age or 
                    income level.
We use this information to create anonymous 
                    usage and interest profiles.
==========
We never provide the contact 
                    data from our surveys to any third party.
However, this information 
                    may be used to contact you about new Multimap.com services.
You are not required to fill in this information to respond 
                    to the survey, and you may opt out of receiving any mailings 
                    from us at any time.
==========
Advertising partners
                    Multimap.com works with outside advertising partners who display 
                    ads on our site.
These ads may contain cookies.
Cookies received 
                    with banner ads are collected by our ad agency, and we do 
                    not have access to this information.
==========
Data Sharing
                    Multimap.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable 
                    information except when we have your permission to do so, 
                    or when required by law.
This section describes some of the 
                    ways that your information may be disclosed.
Partners & Sponsors: 
                    Multimap.com may disclose your personal information to our 
                    partners or sponsors, but only after asking you to sign up 
                    for a particular contest or promotion.
==========
Some or all data collected 
                    during a Multimap promotion may be shared with a sponsor.
If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we 
                    will tell you before we collect.
We collect this data by asking 
                    you to opt in to contests or promotions, rather than requiring 
                    you to opt out.
==========
Many promotions offer opportunities to request 
                    additional information from sponsors.
By requesting more information, 
                    you give Multimap.com permission to transfer your personal 
                    information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request.
==========
In many instances, only your email address will be shared.
Multimap.com may also disclose IP address details in special 
                    cases where disclosing this information is necessary to identify 
                    someone who may be violating our terms of service or our partners' 
                    copyright.
==========
Customer Feedback and Complaints

                    We welcome your questions and comments about privacy issues 
                    and the design of our web site.
Should you have such comments 
                    or have a complaint about how we are using your personal data, 
                    please send an e-mail to info@multimap.com.
