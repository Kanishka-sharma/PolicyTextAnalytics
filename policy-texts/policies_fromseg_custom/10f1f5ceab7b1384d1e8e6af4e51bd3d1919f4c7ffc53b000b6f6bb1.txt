AdMaxim Privacy Policy
Updated: July 1, 2012
AdMaxim LLC.
(“AdMaxim”) has adopted these privacy principles for the website located at AdMaxim.com.
AdMaxim is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence on the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing.
Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines including those established jointly by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, American Association of Advertising Agencies and Direct Marketing Association.
We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising
and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.
The document outlines AdMaxim policy to provide clear notice about the user information we may collect online in connection with our Services and on our own website.
This document also covers the usage of any such information as well as provides information for users to opt-out.
Information We Collect Through our Services
Personally identifiable information (“PII”): We do not collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from users online through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients unless users deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in an opt-in or registration campaigns for example.
==========
PII generally refers to identifying information such as an individual’s name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.
Non-Personal Information (“NPI”): We do collect non-personally identifiable information (“NPI”) to identify computers or mobile device that we have previously interacted with.
For instance, by using NPI, we may identify a computer or mobile device that has previously seen an advertisement we launched on behalf of a client.
In such cases, we do not know who is using a computer or mobile device.
Any reference to ‘you, your, consumer, user’ is to an anonymous user or users of a computer or device.
==========
We may collect usage or interaction with advertisements we manager for our clients.
Purpose of Collecting NPI: Using the collected NPI, AdMaxim provides services to allow advertisers to show you the most relevant advertisements.
This is often referred as ‘behavioral advertisement or behavioral targeting’.
You can learn more about such advertising practices by visiting  http://www.iab.net/privacymatters.
==========
How do we collect information?
We collect NPI through the use of browser cookies, pixels and related technologies.
The use of a cookie or pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular advertisement.
However, we provide users a way to opt-out of receiving cookies as mentioned below.
==========
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
We do not collect PII via our client’s advertisements, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on our or other websites to non-affiliated third parties.
If you affirmatively and deliberately provide PII via one of our client’s advertisements who was identified to you at the time of collection, then that PII will be provided to such client, and such PII shall be subject to that client’s privacy policy.
We may disclose NPI collected through our Services, and information derived from it, to our clients and vendors.
This NPI may be used by our clients to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites and for other purposes as described above.
This information does not include any PII that can be used to contact or identify any person individually.
Further, we encourage our clients, as applicable, to use any NPI they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the information they are gathering is being used.
We urge you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to your online privacy.
==========
We may disclose a user’s NPI to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
In addition and if permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose and provide access to a user’s PII and NPI to our vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf.
However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us.
