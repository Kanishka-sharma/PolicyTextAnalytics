Venatus Media Privacy Policy
Venatus Media is committed to earning your trust and confidence.
To better protect privacy, we provide this privacy policy explaining our online technology and information collection practices.
Venatus Media strongly believes in a consumer’s right to privacy.
What Information Is Collected?
Personally Identifiable (PII) Consumer Data
Venatus Media does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) via our Technology.
Venatus Media does not engage in the collection, distribution, sale or use of personally identifiable information about Web Users, such as email address, name, phone number and street address.
==========
All web user data collected by Venatus Media as part of the ad serving process is not personally identifiable (browser type, for example).
Venatus Media does not know your email address.
Venatus Media does not conduct individual web user “profiling”.
Non-Personally Identifiable (Non-PII) Consumer Data
While visiting the web site of one of Venatus Media’s business customers, including advertisers and web publishers (referred to as “Business Customers”) Venatus Media may collect anonymous data.
This anonymous data contains information such as a web user’s IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time, and responses by a web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor.
Venatus Media or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels.
None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as “non-personally identifiable data”), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual’s personally identifiable information.
How Is Such Information Used?
==========
Venatus Media will use your non-personal information in order to better target advertisements and to improve our advertising systems and products.
Third Party Information Gathering
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Venatus Media.
Venatus Media will not share any Non-PII data with any third parties, with the exception of Appnexus, who we use to deliver targeted advertising messages.
Consumer Choice
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data – Use of Cookies & Opting-Out
Venatus Media uses Appnexus ad-serving technology, including cookies and pixels, to deliver better, targeted marketing messages to individuals.
These tools are used to collect anonymous data for the sole purpose of providing more relevant advertisements to that user.
We believe that the use of such tools assists in providing a more meaningful web-surfing experience.

When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.
The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-Personal Identifiable Information to help us tailor our Clients’ online advertisement campaigns.
Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to return to this page to opt-out again.

Deleting your PII
Although we don’t collect PII via our Technology or our Business Partners, if you’d like us to update, correct, delete or deactivate any PII that you have provided to us on the Website, please send your request to us at privacy@venatusmedia.com and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.
Security Precautions
Venatus Media makes significant efforts to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect.
We use various technologies, including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure the highest security standards.
==========
Any data that is stored on Venatus Media’s servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public.
Venatus Media has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs.
Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium.
==========
Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.
If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us at privacy@venatusmedia.com.
Additional Notices and Disclosures

==========
Sale of Assets
In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets related to the business, we reserve the right to include any or all stored personal information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.
Changes to Privacy Policy
The issue of privacy is an evolving one.
Venatus Media is committed to the consistent monitoring and examination of its privacy practices and may, from time to time, institute changes to its Privacy Policy.
