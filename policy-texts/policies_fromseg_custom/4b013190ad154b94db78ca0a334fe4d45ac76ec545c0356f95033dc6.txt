Whenever we collect sensitive information, such as your company's bank account information or your company's sales out data of Intel's products sold through Intel's authorized distributors, we will take reasonable security measures to protect your information, such as encrypting the information in storage and transmission using encryption devices.
Tracking Activity on Our Websites
Registering on the Intel® Technology Provider Program Websites
When you browse any of the Intel® Technology Provider Program or Reseller Center websites and have not registered for any online service from Intel, you browse anonymously.
==========
Personal or business profile information-such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address-is not collected as you browse.
You will be asked to create a password for your account when you register for the Intel® Technology Provider Programs.
At the time of registration, you will be requested to provide a secret answer to one of several predefined questions.
We use your secret question and answer to help verify your identity to the Intel® Technology Provider Programs if there are account issues, such as needing to reset your password.
==========
Becoming a registered user enables you to view your confidential account information for the program(s) in which you are enrolled, access content that is available only to program members and perform other confidential transactions.
Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Cookies
We track how our Intel® Technology Provider Program websites are used by both anonymous visitors and our program members.
One way we track web activity is by using a small text file that is sent to your browser known as a "cookie."
Cookies collect information such as Internet domain and host names, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser software and operating system types (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer), click-stream patterns and dates and times that our site is accessed.
We also use cookies to collect information on which newsletter links are clicked by program members or whether you responded to a banner ad from outside our site or through an email link.
This information is used to help us ensure we are communicating information program members want to read.
It is collected in the aggregate form and not linked with individual personal information.
==========
A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address or any other personal information.
Cookies from our Intel® Technology Provider Program websites can only be read by Intel websites.
Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.
==========
If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you will be able to view the text on the screens; however, you will not be able to access many important functions of the Intel® Technology Provider Programs or the Reseller Center websites and you will not experience a personalized visit.
Other Tracking Technologies
Another way we track website activity on the Intel® Technology Provider Program web pages is by using transparent electronic images called "clear GIFs," "Web bugs," or "Web beacons".
This technology counts the number of users who visit a particular Intel® Technology Provider Program web page from specific banner ads outside the Intel® Technology Provider Program website or who clicked on links or graphics included in e-mail newsletters you receive from Intel.
==========
We do not use this technology to collect or access your personal information.
Rather we use this technology as a tool to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of the Intel® Technology Provider Program websites.
We may share aggregated site statistics with our service providers for the Intel® Technology Provider Programs.
We do not share these aggregated site statistics with third party companies and do not allow other companies to place clear gifs or other tracking technologies on our sites.
Personalization of Program Benefits or Services
In order to provide you with a meaningful web experience and to improve the quality of services available through the Intel® Technology Provider Programs, Intel may customize its Intel® Technology Provider Program websites or email newsletters for program members based on information you provide to us both in individual (e.g., preferences, job function) and aggregate form (e.g., business profile, sales out information) to provide you information about our products or services that are of interest to you and better meet your needs based on your expressed preferences.
In addition, Intel may track or collect behavioral data (e.g., newsletter or web 'clicks') and aggregate it at a role/job function level to personalize information at the role/job function level (e.g., a technical programmer may click on support information more often than another job role, so Intel may provide them with more support-type information).
==========
Our third-party service providers may send you periodic email newsletters on behalf of Intel informing you about our products and services, as well as activities or events concerning the Intel® Technology Provider Programs.
These third-party service providers may use software tools to track, measure and collect page interaction information, such as the links on which you clicked in a newsletter, based on a unique identification number that is assigned to your email address.
They also retain and report to Intel the individual clicks in the newsletters solely for the purpose of analyzing product preferences and customizing subsequent email newsletters to include products or services that may be of interest to you.
Occasionally Intel may include in its email newsletters information about other companies' services and products that are complementary to Intel's product or service offerings.
We do not sell, rent or lease your information to these third party companies.
Each email newsletter contains a link that allows you to unsubscribe for the newsletter at any time.
Data Storage
Many of our Intel® Technology Provider Program websites that collect information will store and process that information in databases in the United States; however, we may transfer your personal information to Intel Corporation in the US, to any Intel subsidiary worldwide or to third parties acting on behalf of Intel or an Intel subsidiary for the purposes of processing and/or storage.
By using any of the Intel® Technology Provider Program websites, you consent to any transfer of your information outside of your country.
==========
Intel complies with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your data and abides by the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union.
Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Intel adheres to the principles set forth in this privacy statement and strives to provide adequate protection for your information no matter where that information is collected, transferred or retained.
Updating Your Information
Accurate contact and business profile information allows our Intel® Technology Provider Programs to learn more about your business and tailor messages, benefits and program offerings to suit your needs.
We provide you with the means to ensure that the information you provide to Intel is correct and current.
