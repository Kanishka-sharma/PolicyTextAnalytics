As used by most Web sites online today, our Web server makes a note every time a computer accesses our server with the day, time, resource accessed, and resource referred by.
We use this data to compile daily Web stats on our sites, and no personally identifiable information is available from this information.
If you fail to provide the requested information to register on our discussion forums or send us an email, you may be unable to actively participate in our forums, or receive a reply to your email.
The only way to opt-out of our Web site traffic analysis is to stop visiting this Web site.

Security of Your Data
Hey, who wants data to be floating out in cyberspace without security?
==========
Not us, that's for sure.
That's why all of our servers are located in physically-restricted collocation facilities, and are secured with strong usernames and passwords for administrative access.
