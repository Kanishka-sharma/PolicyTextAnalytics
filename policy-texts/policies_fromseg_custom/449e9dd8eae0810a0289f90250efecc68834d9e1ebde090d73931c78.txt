This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Nebraska, USA, as they are applied to agreements that are entered into and performed entirely within the State of Nebraska.

ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT AND FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
You and Sojern agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in Omaha, Nebraska, and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned or transferred by Sojern without restriction.
