The Explore feature of the Service gives you recommendations about where to go and specials and offers nearby.
These recommendations are based on and include the places you've been, the places your friends have visited, places and things you and your friends like/dislike, your loyalty to your favorite places, the categories and types of places you go, what places and things are popular with other users, the day of the week, places with great tips, the time of day, and so on.
If you don't want your friends to see your check-ins as part of what they see in Explore you can check-in privately.
Please note, however, that your private check ins will still be used by the explore feature, in the aggregate, to help us determine what things are popular with foursquare users in general.

Sharing with Partners, in connection with business transfers, and for the protection of foursquare and others:

In certain situations, these businesses sell items or provide promotions to you through foursquare's Service.
In other situations, foursquare provides services, or sells products jointly with these businesses.
You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business, unless you have elected not to be solicited by marketing partners during the registration process or through the account settings page.
Business Transfers: If foursquare or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that foursquare goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
Protection of foursquare and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of foursquare, our employees, our users, or others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
