Effective Date: October 5, 2016
Smaato, Inc. (“Smaato,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) provides this privacy policy to explain how we collect, use, and share information.
This privacy policy (“Policy”) covers Smaato’s handling of two types of information:
Information we receive about end users (“End Users”) of third-party mobile applications (“apps”) that use our Software Development Kit (“SDK”), the Smaato Demand Platform (“SDX”), or the Smaato Publisher Platform (“SPX”) (collectively, the “Smaato Ad Services”), and
Information we receive through our corporate website at www.smaato.com or any other website on which this Policy is posted, as well as information we get through other corporate services and web portals we make available to clients and business partners (“Smaato Websites”).
We describe the information received through the Smaato Websites in Section 5 below, entitled “Privacy Practices for the Smaato Websites.”
==========
We encourage consumers to learn about how information (including information we collect) can be used to market to them, and how to exercise their choices to permit or limit such marketing.
We describe ways consumers can exercise that choice or opt out of marketing in Section 4 below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
1.
==========
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Smaato provides mobile advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile websites and/or apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”), and service providers and other data partners (collectively “Partners”).
We do this by making available the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to Clients.
Clients use the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to deliver advertising to End Users, and we in turn provide our services to help Clients (and their own customers) to deliver ads that are of interest to End Users.
We explain what SDKs are in Section 3 below, entitled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs,” which also explains how cookies and similar technologies (which we also use to provide the Smaato Ad Services) work.
2.
==========
PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR THE SMAATO AD SERVICES
a. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE SMAATO AD SERVICES
Through the Smaato Ad Services, we may (but do not necessarily, or always) collect a variety of information about End Users (whether through our SDK or through other partnerships and tools such as Client-facing APIs), including:
IP addresses, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information such as information about End Users’ operating system;
Precise geolocation information (generally an End User’s latitude and longitude data);
Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs (collectively, “Mobile IDs”).
These Mobile IDs may be associated with other information we collect through the Smaato Ad Services, from third parties, or through any other services we offer;
Apps that you have installed, mobile websites that you have interacted with, and how you interact with them, including whether and how you interact with ads (including time-stamp information);
Device type and other device information (e.g., whether you are using a smartphone or tablet, and related information);
Network provider;
Mobile browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, and Chrome);
Carrier user ID (a number uniquely allocated to you by your network provider);
Other unique identifiers that may be associated with an End Users’ device, including identifiers provided by Clients or their service providers; and
Email addresses, which we generally handle in or convert to “hashed” (i.e., machine-readable, but non-human readable) form.
We may combine and merge the various types of information collected from the Smaato Ad Services, and may also enhance it (or permit our Clients to enhance it) with information collected from third parties.
We refer to all of the above information as the “Service Information.”
b.
==========
How We Use the Information Collected Through the Smaato Ad Services
We use the Service Information to provide a variety of services to our Clients related to advertising and marketing, including services we may describe elsewhere on Smaato Websites.
This includes use of the Service Information for purposes such as to:
Provide and improve the Smaato Ad Services.
This includes, for example, providing customer, technical, and operational support for these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity, and resolving disputes and enforcing our terms and conditions and other rights we may have.
This may also include analyzing, customizing, and improving the features of the Smaato Ad Services;
Provide information and analytics to Clients about the use of app features provided through the Smaato Ad Services, or help Clients create or enhance user profiles for marketing or analytics purposes;
Create inferences about End Users categorized into “Audience Segments” or to help Clients do so.
For example, if the information we collect indicates that an End User likes apps (or clicks on ads) about travel, we may categorize the End User of that device as someone who is interested in travel;
Develop and use data models that try to predict End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis or across devices;
Analyze ad performance, for example, by attributing End Users’ app installations or mobile web visits to ad campaigns;
Resolve identities across multiple devices, such as to match IP addresses or hashed emails to link an End User across, for example, mobile browsers, mobile devices, tablets, set top boxes, or other devices; and
Combine the Service Information to perform (including by working with Clients and Partners) any of the above functions, or other advertising, marketing, or analytics services.
Or, we may aggregate and create data models to do this, by creating algorithms in order to predict common interests among End Users.
We may provide End Users’ email addresses (which we generally hash) to Clients that match this information to online cookies or Mobile IDs in their system, and tie the information or associated IDs to additional interest-based or demographic data about End Users.
==========
This may be done, for example, to target advertising or provide analytics to other parties.
We or our Clients may deploy online cookies to track End Users across mobile websites and/or apps, or to associate End Users and these cookies with Mobile IDs.
We or our Clients may perform such functions to resolve End Users’ identities across mobile devices and to better or more accurately target relevant ads to End Users (such as to a brand’s customers).
We may also append or combine certain elements of the Service Information (such as hashed email addresses) to other information provided by third party data providers, to learn more about End Users or to provide advertising and analytics services.
You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in Section 3 below, entitled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs.”
c.
==========
How We Share Information We Collect Through the Smaato Ad Services
Generally, we share the Service Information with Clients and Partners in order to provide the Smaato Ad Services.
For example, we share the Service Information with:
Clients and their marketing and service providers, so they may provide targeted content and advertising to End Users on mobile websites and/or apps;
Other third parties that target advertising.
This may include, for example, platforms that work directly with marketers (sometimes called demand-side platforms), analytics companies, data management platforms that help marketers maintain and use data, proximity solution providers, and other advertising technology providers.
These companies may, for example, provide targeted content and advertising to End Users and others on third-party mobile websites and/or apps or other advertising media (such as email, direct mail, and display media);
Clients and their marketing and service providers, to help measure the effectiveness of marketing or analyze their End Users’ likely interests or demographics;
Partners to enhance consumer privacy, hash information, or send advertising offers by email or display advertising (which may be linked to a cookie as described above); and
Third-party platforms to help advertisers identify common users across different mobile devices and/or mobile browsers.
Even when you no longer access our SDK, we may continue to use and share your information as described in this Policy.
The processes we described above often involve cookies or similar technologies, which may be associated with other information about End Users, such as End Users’ interests, demographics, or transactions.
==========
This is generally known as “interest-based advertising.”
We encourage individuals who are interested in controlling or learning about this type of advertising to go to Section 4 below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options,” or go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) website at www.aboutads.info.
We may also share Service Information with third parties:
Pursuant to a request or authorization by an End User or Client;
If the disclosure is provided to: (a) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement; (b) enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements; or (c) protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity;
Where the information is aggregated or de-identified; and
As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence).

COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS, AND SDKs
a. Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as unique browser identifiers.
Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your browser.
Our servers may deploy a cookie on your browser when you visit the Smaato Websites.
Our Clients and Partners may do likewise on the Smaato Websites, our Clients’ and Partners’ websites, and elsewhere.
Smaato may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
Persistent cookies, unlike session cookies, remain after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to any given website.
Using persistent cookies, a site operator (or a third party they work with) can “remember” what you have previously done on a website and personalize the site, or ads you see, for you.
This technology may also provide a site operator or third party (or us, when you visit the Smaato Websites) with information regarding your IP address, browser type, the web pages that you visit just before or after visiting a website, the web pages viewed, and the dates and times of your visits.
==========
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.
When you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or Partners, to set or read cookies.
Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device.
If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit.
We, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, for example, “remember” you, track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising.
We, and our Clients and Partners, use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.
If you wish to opt out of interest-based mobile advertising, please see Section 4 below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the Smaato Websites’ functionalities and offerings, and those of other websites you visit.
==========
b. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We, or our Clients or Partners, may use or work with mobile SDKs (including our own SDK(s), which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Smaato Ad Services and those using our Smaato Ad Services.
The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
We may use this technology, for example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.
If you would like to opt out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 4 below, entitled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
Our Clients or Partners may use the above technologies (sometimes, in combination with each other or other data such as IP addresses or hashed or de-identified data files) to coordinate identifiers across platforms, browsers, or devices, in order to more efficiently analyze or target advertising.
4.
==========
CONSUMER CONTROL AND OPT-OUT OPTIONS
In most cases, consumers have control over whether or not they would like to receive relevant ads and marketing email from our Clients.
a. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising
You can opt out of many of the platforms and service providers we work with that support online interest-based advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info (or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are located in the European Union).
This type of opt out is cookie-based, which means that if you replace or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again.
Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads; rather, the ads you see will be less customized to you.
b. Opting Out of Cross-App Advertising on Mobile Devices
You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of interest-based mobile advertising (also called “cross-app advertising”), including those performed by Smaato, by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows:
Apple Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher and enabling “Limit Ad Tracking.”
iOS 7 and Higher: Go to Settings → Privacy → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
iOS 6: Go to Settings → General → About → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
Android Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by going to Google Settings → Ads, and selecting the option to opt out of interest-based ads.
Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change.
Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described above, please check the settings for those devices.
c. Additional Choices
Advertisers may also provide ways for you to opt out from, or limit their collection of, certain information from and about you.
Please refer to the privacy policies for retailers, apps, and mobile websites to learn more about their privacy practices.
==========
You may opt out from receiving promotional emails from us, such as emails to inform you about events and new services, by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any promotional email you receive, or by contacting us at marketing@smaato.com.
Please note, however, that we may still send you non-promotional emails relating to your relationship with us.
