Privacy Statement
Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.
We gather certain types of information about the users of Edmunds.com and its services, and we believe our users should fully understand the specifics concerning the capture and use of that information.
==========
This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
Any comments or questions about this Privacy Statement or our privacy policies should be directed to us though our Feedback Form.
==========
General
The submission of personally identifying information (e.g., your name, e-mail address or postal address) to Edmunds.com and/or to one of our partners may be required to receive certain services, products or catalogs.
This information may be shared between Edmunds.com and that partner.
If you give your consent, this information also may be shared with our other partners or other third parties to help us improve our services or to notify you about other products and services.
That is, you may receive information from us or from other companies or by e-mail, U.S. mail or other means.
==========
However, if we do not have your express consent, our policy is not to provide your personally identifiable information to anyone else, except as provided below.
We may send personally identifying information to other companies who work on behalf of Edmunds.com to provide a product or service to you.
(Unless we advise you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.)
In addition, Edmunds.com may disclose personally identifying information, without first notifying you or obtaining your consent, upon receipt of legal process seeking such information, or if Edmunds.com determines that disclosure of such information: (i) is otherwise required by law; (ii) is reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds.com Town Hall Membership Agreement (see "Edmunds.com Town Hall" below); or (iii) is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds.com, its users or other persons or entities.

Cookies
"Cookies" are small data files that many Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.
A cookie file contains information such as a user ID that a site may use to track the pages you've visited.
However, the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.
==========
A cookie can't read data from your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites; a cookie can only be read by the Web site that served the cookie to you.
Edmunds.com uses cookies in the following ways:
First Visits: When you first visited our site, Edmunds.com served a cookie to you.
This cookie resides permanently on your hard drive (unless you chose to delete it) and enables us to track user activity across our site.
==========
Zip Code: When you first provide your zip code to us, whether through the use of one of our applications (such as the Edmunds.com True Market Value® tools, PowerShopper or Dealer Locator), or in response to a direct request by us that you provide your zip code, Edmunds.com serves a cookie to you that includes your zip code.
That cookie permits us to recognize your zip code when you use other applications, or upon your return to our site, without our having to ask you again for your zip code.
If you subsequently use a different your zip code in one of our applications, this cookie is updated to reflect that new zip code.
==========
Applications: Whenever you use an application on our site, such as those listed above, Edmunds.com may serve a "session cookie" to you, which is a cookie that is only used by us during your use of that application.
Town Hall Registration: When you register to become a member of Town Hall, Edmunds.com uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID.
We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database, and to enable you to enter Town Hall as a member without having to log on each time.
==========
See "Edmunds.com Town Hall" below.
Newsletters: Edmunds.com uses cookies in connection with the delivery of its newsletters.
==========
This allows us to measure and report the click-through rate for the links within the newsletters and then better determine future content.
See "Electronic Newsletters" below.
==========
Advertisements: Edmunds.com's advertising system delivers cookies to better track ad impressions and click rates.
See "Third-Party Ad Servers" below.
==========
Edmunds.com Town Hall
In order to post a message in the message boards that are a part of Edmunds.com Town Hall, you must be a registered member.
You do not need to register in order to browse or read others' posts.
==========
Membership Agreement
If you register as a member of Town Hall, you are subject to the Town Hall Membership Agreement.
Information Collected
Registration for Town Hall requires that the registrant provide a valid e-mail address.
A password for the registrant's Town Hall login ID is sent to that address.
A member must use this password for the initial visit to Town Hall and may elect to change the password after that initial visit.
Information Sharing and Disclosure Practices
When a member posts a message in Town Hall, that member's login ID is visible to other users.
This login ID is linked to the user profile, which others may view.
A member may elect to make the information included in the user profile, such as the member's e-mail address, public to other members, or the member may elect to keep that information private.
When you post a message in Town Hall, you have the ability to include personally identifiable information about yourself.
If you do so, you may receive unsolicited messages from other individuals.
==========
Edmunds.com maintains the privacy of personal information provided by members of Town Hall.
However, Edmunds.com may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, as described above under "General."
In addition, Edmunds.com may share with third parties members' postings as well as non-personal, or summary, information concerning members and their activities.
Town Hall members will not be placed on any of our mailing lists except with their express consent.
However, Edmunds.com reserves the right to contact members using their e-mail address regarding our community policies or other matters that Edmunds.com believes are of general interest to the membership.
==========
Your Ability to Update or Delete Postings
· You are given the option of previewing your message by clicking on the "Preview" button.
This allows you to make any necessary changes before posting your message.
After you post a message, you have 30 minutes to make any changes.
You may delete your own messages at any time.
==========
Electronic Newsletters
Edmunds.com offers free electronic newsletters that are dispatched by e-mail.
Edmunds.com gathers the e-mail addresses of individuals who voluntarily subscribe, as well as demographic information from optional survey questions (see "Surveys" below).
==========
Individuals may subscribe, and subscribers may remove themselves from one or more of our mailing lists, through the Subscription Management Page.
Edmunds.com delivers newsletters, and marketing and product offerings promoted in newsletters, by e-mail only to registered recipients from our subscription center.
The e-mail tracking system recognizes the URL that was clicked, and records some information about you and your computer, such as the e-mail address that you provided to us, the browser, operating system and IP address.
==========
While aggregate counts of click-through behavior are provided to advertisers within our newsletters, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.
Edmunds.com may target advertising according to the optional demographic information you provide at the time of subscription to the Newsletter.
However, Edmunds.com will not provide specific user information to any third party unless you have given your explicit permission on our subscription page.
Surveys
Occasionally Edmunds.com conducts user surveys to better target our content to our audience or for the benefit of third parties with whom we do business.
==========
Accordingly, sometimes the aggregate survey results are shared with our advertisers and partners.
We never share any survey information about specific individuals with any third party.
==========
New Vehicle PowerShopper and Dealer Locator Services
Edmunds.com's New Vehicle PowerShopper service may collect personally identifiable information about you, depending on which of our partners you select, and Edmunds.com's Dealer Locator service does collect personally identifiable information about you if you chose to contact a dealer through that service.
That information is not shared (except in aggregate form in a manner that does not include any personally identifiable information) with any third parties, other than the partner you select, unless you expressly give us your permission.
==========
Edmunds.com's TMV® Finance Rate Estimator
Edmunds.com's TMV® Finance Rate Estimator (the "Estimator") provides you with national average loan rates currently being offered by banks for new and used vehicles; requests specific information concerning your credit history and zip code; and then, based on that information, provides you with both (i) the local average loan rates currently being offered for new and used vehicles by lending institutions in your market, and (ii) our estimate of which "credit tier" you will qualify for when you apply for financing.
Edmunds.com does not collect personally identifying information of any kind when you use the Estimator, nor does Edmunds.com record or store any of the information you provide when using the Estimator.
As a result, you can use the Estimator with confidence that neither Edmunds.com nor any other person or entity will know the answers you give or the results generated for you by the Estimator.
==========
Edmunds.com may include in the Estimator links to partners, and the partners that are presented to you may depend on which credit tier you have been placed in by the Estimator and/or the zip code you provide.
As a result, a partner may be aware that individuals who are referred from the Estimator have, based on the information they provided to the Estimator, been placed by Edmunds.com in a particular tier or are located in a particular area.
However, that partner will not know your identity or the answers you give to any of the questions in the Estimator (other than your zip code) unless you chose to separately provide information about yourself to that partner.
Partners will not make any determination to offer or deny you credit or any other product or service other than on the basis of information you separately provide to such partner.
==========
Edmunds.com has no control over the privacy practices or information that partner sites may request of you.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites.
==========
