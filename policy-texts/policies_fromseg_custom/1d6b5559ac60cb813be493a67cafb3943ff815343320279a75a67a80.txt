We only disclose Mortgage User Information in compliance with applicable laws.
In the questionnaire, we obtain authorization from a Mortgage User to disclose Mortgage User Information to participating banks, mortgage brokers, loan brokers, financial institutions, and in some cases aggregators (collectively, "Lenders") in the questionnaire and state that we cannot provide our mortgage-related services without such authorization.

After the Mortgage User has left our Site, we continue to treat Mortgage User Information as confidential and do not disclose it to third parties other than as authorized by the Mortgage User.
We do not provide a means of updating Mortgage User Information.
Any such updates should be provided directly to the Lenders that contact the Mortgage User.
Confidentiality and Security
We restrict access to Mortgage User Information to those NexTag employees and agents who need to know that information to provide better enable us to provide mortgage-related and other services to Mortgage Users.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your Mortgage User Information.
