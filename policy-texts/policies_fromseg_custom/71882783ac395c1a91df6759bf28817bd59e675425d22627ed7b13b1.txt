a. Cookies
 
Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember certain information.
We use first-party and third-party cookies for the following purposes: (1) to make the Dasher Services function properly; (2) to improve the Dasher Services; (3) to recognize you when you return to DoorDash and to remember information you have already provided, such as your preferences; (4) to collect information about your activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests; and (5) to provide a secure browsing experience during your use of the Dasher Services.

We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices.
If you wish to opt out of cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings.
==========
We may also use cross-device targeting to help identify our users and serve advertising.
This type of advertising is often called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising—and when it occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app” advertising.
You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising by visiting (i) the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.
Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us.
However, in that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.
Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
==========
f. Mobile Applications
 
Depending on your permissions, we may receive your personal information from your Internet service and mobile device providers.
Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out in several ways.
Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
==========
Each operating system, (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
You should view your device or system “Settings” to determine how you can opt out of use of your device ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising.
