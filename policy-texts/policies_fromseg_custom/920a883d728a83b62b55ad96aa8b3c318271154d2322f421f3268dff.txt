Information Collected When You Make A Purchase
When you make a purchase at any of our retail outlets or online, we will collect necessary information about you to ensure we can fulfil your order or chosen service.
If you choose to pay by card, we will need to collect your payment information in order to process card payments.
We may also need to ask for additional information from you, e.g. to prevent fraudulent transactions, to comply with anti-money laundering obligations for high value transactions, or to ensure that we comply with our legal obligations such as age restrictions applicable to the sale of guns, knives or alcohol, or the legal requirement to share your details with the TV Licensing Authority when you purchase a television.
Where you place an order with Harrods for products or services that will be delivered, collected or provided at a later date, we will need to take additional contact details and delivery information from you so that we may complete your order.
We may use third party couriers to deliver your order and will need to share your contact information with them for this purpose.
==========
Managing Your Marketing Preferences
At any point that you interact with us, you may be given the opportunity to opt-in to receive Harrods marketing communications.
Harrods will only send you marketing communications where you have consented to receive them and using your preferred channels of communication.
To ensure that you are still happy to hear from us, if you have not updated your marketing preferences in two years, we will contact you to remind you that you can opt-out of receiving marketing communications at any time:
Where you have not made a purchase with Harrods during this two year period, we will only continue to send you marketing communications where you expressly tell us that you want to.
If you do nothing, then we will stop sending you marketing communications.
Where you have made a purchase with Harrods during this period, we will continue to communicate with you in the same way until you tell us otherwise.
If you do nothing, we will assume that you are happy for Harrods to continue to send you marketing communications in the same way.
==========
If you have opted-in to receive marketing communications from us you can manage your preferences online at any time.
We have created a Preference Centre where you can manage your marketing communications preferences and tell us what you want to hear about and how you want Harrods to communicate with you.
We will send you marketing material that we believe you will be interested in based on your previous spending behaviour.
==========
You may not receive all types of communications that you have chosen to receive.
To understand more about the criteria we use to determine which marketing communications you receive, please contact customer.services@harrods.com 
Please note that when you visit one of Harrods’ brand partners in-Store or participate in a branded promotion or event, our brand partners may also ask if you want to sign up to receive marketing communications directly from them about their events, products and services.
If you provide your personal details to any of our brand partners, the use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy and cannot be managed through Harrods or the Preference Centre.
Please ask the relevant sales associate for details about their privacy policy and how you can manage your marketing communications preferences with them.

From time to time, we may also collect publically available information about you which is not essential to delivery of the Rewards Programme but which enables us to learn more about you and, in turn, provide a more tailored service.
If you would like to stop Harrods using this information about you in this way, please contact us at data.protection@harrods.com
As part of the Harrods Rewards Programme, Harrods operates the Mini Harrods Programme which offers customers additional exclusive benefits, promotions and events tailored towards children under the age of ten.

Harrods Personal Shopping Services
In order to deliver the best possible customer experience, Harrods offers a variety of Personal Shopping services that may involve you sharing additional personal information about yourself with Harrods so that we can tailor your shopping experience to provide you with recommendations of products and services that may be relevant to your lifestyle and preferences.
We understand that as part of this, you may share with us sensitive information about your personal circumstances or festivals and holidays that are important to you.
Harrods will always ensure that we have your consent to use this sensitive information as part of the Personal Shopping service.
The level and content of the information that you provide to Harrods and the communications that you receive as part of the Personal Shopping service is always set and agreed to by you.
==========
You can discuss these arrangements and change them at any time by speaking to the Personal Shopping team directly.
Please note that your Personal Shopping arrangements are not part of Harrods general marketing communications and cannot be managed through the Preference Centre.
To ensure that you are still happy with the service provided by Harrods, if we have not discussed your existing arrangements with you for 2 years, we will contact you to check that you are still happy with these arrangements.
==========
If we are unable to contact you for any reason, your existing personal details will be retained but your account will be set as “dormant” until we can confirm that you are happy to continue using the service (please note that we will delete any sensitive information about you while the account is dormant).
If we are unable to reach you for a further 2 years, then we will delete all information held by the Personal Shopping team and formally close your Personal Shopping account.
If you prefer not to use Harrods’ formal Personal Shopping services, our sales associates will be more than happy for you to share your personal details with them on an informal basis for a specific purpose, such as asking to be contacted when a certain product is back in stock.
We will only use this information for the specific purpose that you have agreed to, after which your information will be deleted.
You may also provide your personal details to our brand partners operating in our retail outlets and the use of your information will be subject to the brand’s privacy policy.
If you are unsure, please ask the sales associate to confirm whether your information is being collected by Harrods or by the individual brand and ask for details about their privacy policy.

Harrods is committed to keeping your personal information only for so long as is necessary or where we have a legitimate interest to continue doing so.

Where you shop online with Harrods but use our guest checkout path, we will only retain your personal details for a reasonable period of time after you have completed the transaction in order to fulfil any contractual obligations such as refunds and guarantees (unless you also receive Harrods.com marketing communications, in which case we will add this order information to your customer record).
Please note that if you have registered for an account on harrods.com and/or have a Harrods Rewards Card, but choose to use our guest checkout path, we will add the guest checkout purchase to your customer record internally automatically.
It will not be visible on your order history page as that will only show orders though the registered user journey.
