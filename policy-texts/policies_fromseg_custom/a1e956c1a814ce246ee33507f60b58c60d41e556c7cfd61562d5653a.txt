==========
What information do we collect at this website?
At compete.com, we offer a number of services that do not require you
        to register for an account
        or provide any personal information to us, such as Compete Site Profiles and
        Comparison.
However, some of our Services will require the provision of certain

Information you provide

        services, such as our premium offerings, we also request credit card or other
        payment account information which will be maintained by third party merchant(s)
        or payment processor(s) in encrypted form on secure servers.
We may combine the
        information you submit under your account with information from other Compete
        services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and

==========
Compete Blog e-mail updates are administered by a 3rd party
        service provider.
E-mail addresses provided to them via the automated form
        on the blog are used solely for the purpose of sending you blog alerts.
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend that
        you think Compete.com might be of interest to them, we will ask you for
        your friend's name and e-mail address.
We will automatically send your

==========

Your friend may contact
        us to request that we remove this information from our database.
Please be

        to do so.
When you contact us via our Contact form, send e-mail or other
        communication to Compete, we may retain those communications in order to
        process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
==========
Cookies, Beacons and Site Logging
To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology.
Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive,
        which enable a Website to "personalize" itself for each user.
We generally use
        cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to
        assist with customer tracking.
Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected
        by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully
        used Compete.com.
==========
Cookies are not tied to your personal information.
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
        Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what
        content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,
        similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web
        users.
Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.
We
        also use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the
        recipients have opened.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
        communications.
==========
When you use Compete services, our servers automatically record
        information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website.
These server logs
        may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser
        type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies
        that may uniquely identify your browser.
What information does our technology collect?
==========
When you download Compete software, including the Compete Toolbar, you
        will be given the option of enabling click-sharing.
Should you opt-in to
        click-sharing you will begin to anonymously share the addresses of the web pages
        you visit online.
==========
Using the small piece of software you download, we collect information related
        to your website visitation and internet usage.
We use this information, in anonymous
        or aggregated fashion, to help our clients understand what sites, products, and
        services our members interact with.
The small piece of software uses a proprietary
        rules engine to search through all URLs (internet site addresses), before transmitting
        them to its database, to strip out any such personally identifiable information.
==========
If
        any personal information, for ex.
something you may have typed into a field on a page,
        inadvertently collected by the software, we make every commercially viable effort to purge
        our database of that information promptly.
In any event, we do not disclose the
        contents of such information stored in our databases - so we will not release or use this
        information anyway.
==========
As a member of the compete.com community you are assigned a randomly generated user
        ID ensuring your anonymity.
The only contact information associated with your user
        ID is your registration e-mail, which we only use to send you service updates and other
        requested communications that you have signed up to receive from us.
==========
To calculate more robust metrics for our users, we also license URL and
        demographic data (age, gender, household income, geographical location, etc.) from
        multiple sources including ISPs and ASPs.
We honor the privacy of our Members and
        the privacy policies of our licensors and do not knowingly collect or license
        personally identifiable information from members or licensors.
Again, Compete
        aggregates data on multiple users before supplying any data, thereby
        ensuring an individual's privacy.
Compete may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of
        whether these links have been followed.
==========
We use this information to improve the
        quality of our services.
We may use a 3rd party partner for database or software application services
        (such as customer support, email or survey and for purposes of data quality, data
        cleansing .
==========
In addition, we may occasionally supplement information panel members
        provide us with public information (such as demographic information, ownership
        information or similar) available through third parties.
In all cases, we ensure
        your privacy by having these third parties sign a written, legally binding
        agreement stipulating that they will not share our data with any outside party and
        that any individual identifying information is to be used solely for the purpose
        of matching records or providing the agreed upon database service.
This Policy applies to all information that you provide to Compete.com.
However,
        when you visit websites to which Compete.com links, keep in mind you will be
        interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security
        policy.
If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site,
        the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy
        policy.
A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of
        cookies and clear gifs.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
        other service provider from whom you request services.
Are there any other third parties with whom we share your information?
Compete.com only shares personal information with individuals outside of
        Compete as disclosed in the compete.com  Privacy Policy and in the following limited
        circumstances:
We have a good faith
        belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of information is reasonably
        necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
        governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including
        investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise
        address fraud, security or technical issues, (d) protect against imminent harm to
        the rights, property or safety of Compete, its users or the public as required or
        permitted by law, (e) allow service providers and/or vendors to fulfill Services
        for you on behalf of Compete or (f) pursuant to an acquisition, merger, sale of
        assets or other business transfer.
What is our policy regarding children's privacy?
==========

We do not knowingly
        collect or use personal information about visitors under 13 years of age.
If you are
        under 13 years of age, you can use the services offered on our website only in
        conjunction with your parents or guardians.
==========
What security measures do we have in place to ensure that your data is kept securely?
We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to
        or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information.
These measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
        processing practices and security practices.
We restrict access to personal information to Compete employees, contractors
        and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop
        or improve our services.
We take reasonable efforts to ensure all parties
        comply with confidentiality obligations.
We store all personal information on our servers in the United States of America.

We will post any
        policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide
        a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, e-mail notification of
