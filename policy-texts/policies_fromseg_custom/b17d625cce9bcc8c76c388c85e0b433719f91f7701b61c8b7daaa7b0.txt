Most Microsoft websites use "cookies," which are small text files stored on your device, to help operate the sites and collect information about online activity.
The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it may contain other information as well.
Here is an example of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that we might place on your device when you visit one of our websites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801.
==========
Our websites may also contain web beacons or other similar technologies.
Microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, described in more detail below.
How to Control Cookies and Similar TechnologiesMicrosoft provides browser controls to help you manage cookies.
==========
You can also accept cookies but opt out of their use to behaviorally target advertisements.
For instance, Microsoft’s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/.Browser Controls to Block Cookies.Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify your browser setting to block cookies.
For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you can block cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies  Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at each browser’s privacy statement.
Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and any advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost.
==========
Browser Controls to Delete Cookies.If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.
For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you can delete cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies” Click the "Delete" button Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at each browser’s privacy statement.
Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and will need to be recreated.
==========
Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection.Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
Those sites (or the third-party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Microsoft provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information.
We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.
==========
In the meantime, users may continue to opt out of targeted ads from Microsoft as set forth below.Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the websites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers.
When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked.
By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you.
For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer Privacy Statement or Internet Explorer Help.
==========
Advertising Opt-Out Controls.Because cookies can be used for many purposes, users who do not want to receive behaviorally targeted advertising can choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use.
Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users’ privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft).
These pages include: Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices.
For instance, Microsoft’s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/.
Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted.
In addition, opting out does not stop information from going to our servers, but it does stop our creation or updating of profiles that might be used for behavioral advertising.
==========
Third-Party Analytics Controls.As described in more detail below, many websites and online services from Microsoft and other companies use third-party analytic services, which use cookies and web beacons to compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of promotional campaigns or other website operations.
You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking the following links: Our Use of CookiesMicrosoft websites use cookies for several purposes, including: Storing your Preferences and Settings.
If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site.
This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.
==========
Sign-in and Authentication.
When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device.
This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page.
==========
Targeted Advertising.
When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more cookies on your device in order to recognize it each time we display an ad to you.
Because we serve advertisements on the websites of our advertising and publisher partners, as well as our own, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed.
==========
This information helps us select the ads we show you.
For example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly.
It also helps us select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you.
You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement.
==========
Site Analytics.
We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services.
These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.
==========
Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart.
This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the main reasons we typically set cookies.
If you visit one of our websites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:  Cookie name Description MUID Identifies unique browsers visiting Microsoft sites.
It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.ANON Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a customer may like.

This cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.
ACH01 Maintains information about which ads you clicked on and where you clicked on the ad.
TOptOut Records your decision not to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.
==========
In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our websites, third parties may also set cookies when you visit Microsoft sites.
In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics.
In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks.
Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.
Our Use of Web BeaconsMicrosoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services.
==========
Sometimes we include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
We sometimes work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.
Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations.
These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer.
These companies may collect information about your online activities across websites or online servers, however, we prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address).
==========
You may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies as described under “Third-Party Analytics Controls” above.
Other Similar TechnologiesIn addition to standard cookies and web beacons, websites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer.
This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally.
==========
But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track online activity.
These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or "Flash cookies"), HTML5 Local Storage and Silverlight Application Storage.
Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies."
Websites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer.
