BROWSING DATA PROCESSED BY NUMBERLY
Since its creation, Numberly has always sought to anticipate the expectations of consumers and Internet users, both in terms of protecting their privacy and in commercial matters.
==========
Our ultimate ambition is to send Our Members offers that may indeed interest them, which are more relevant and less frequent than those disseminated by Our competitors.
Therefore, in order to adapt the frequency of sending and the type of offers sent by Numberly to its Members, We process the Browsing Data attached to their Terminal(s) and to the browsing software(s) used by their Terminal(s).
3.1.
==========
WHAT IS BROWSING DATA?
This is data relating to Traffic, as defined in paragraphs b) and c) of Article 2 of the “ePrivacy” Directive 2002/58/EC amended by Directive 2009/136/EC, and, in particular:
the IP address of the Terminal connected to the Internet,

the URL (Internet address) of the Internet page accessed by the Terminal consulting an electronic communication service,
the type of operating system used by the Terminal (Windows, MacOs, Linux, Unix, BeOS, etc.),
the type and version of browser software used by a Terminal (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc.),
the language of use by the browsing software used by the Terminal,
the identifier and content of a cookie file stored by Us in the Terminal.
3.2.
WHAT DO WE USE THEM FOR?
==========
– To secure Our Services
Some Browsing Data must be retained in accordance with the law.
This is to enable Us to ensure the security of Our electronic communication Services and to detect, prevent or recover malicious attempts or computer intrusion or breaches of the terms of use of Our Services.
Such is the case of the IP address and the dates and times of connection of a Terminal to one of Our Services.
==========
– To measure the receipt and reading of Our e-mails
We may process Browsing Data when We receive or consult an electronic survey that We have sent to a Member.
This Browsing Data may result, in particular, from the storage and/or reading of Cookies that We operate within emails distributed by Us, subject to the choices expressed by the Member concerned in their browser software and with Us (see Article 4 below).
This Browsing Data allows Us:
to account for Terminals receiving and accessing electronic prospecting sent by Numberly to Users,
to gather statistics for the receipt and consultation by Users of the electronic surveys We send to them and,
to ensure the follow-up and invoicing base to Our Partners of Our Services for sending direct prospecting by email to Users.
– To adapt interactive advertisements to a User
We may have to process Browsing Data relating to a User’s reaction to an email (or SMS, MMS, etc.) that We sent them: has this email been received and consulted?
Has the Member reacted or not to the content of this email?
Have they visited the online service promoted by this email?
Has the Member subscribed to the offer promoted, etc.?
==========
Other Browsing Data may also relate to a User’s visit to one of Our Partners’ services, and said visit to such service or reaction to the display of an interactive Advertisement that We have displayed or broadcast on behalf of one of Our Partners on one of Our Partners’ or a Third Party’s services.
This Browsing Data associated with a Cookie issued by Numberly also relates to the consultation of Our Partners’ electronic communication services by a Member’s Terminal.
Where applicable, this Browsing Data allows Us, subject to Your agreement and subsequently, unless You object thereto, to determine which interactive advertisements or electronic prospecting (by email, SMS or MMS) are likely to interest a User, according to the electronic communication services of Our Partners previously consulted by their Terminal as noted by reading the Cookies that We operate in relation to our Partners and that are stored on Your Terminal.
This Data also enables Us to constantly improve the relevance of interactive advertising and electronic prospecting (by email, SMS or MMS) likely to interest a User.
However, when a Member’s Terminal is used by several people and when the same Terminal has several browsers, We cannot ensure that interactive advertising or electronic prospecting addressed to a User or to their Terminal corresponds to their own use of the Terminal and not to that of other users of the same Terminal.
==========
Management by the Member of privacy protection parameters offered by the browsing software(s) of their Terminal, is their own free choice and sole responsibility.
Where applicable, sharing the use of the Terminal with other persons is the Member’s free choice and responsibility.
– To adapt interactive advertisements to a Terminal
Browsing Data allows us to adapt the content or display of an interactive advertisement intended for a Member’s Terminal, by determining:
the language used by the Member’s Terminal,
the display resolution of the interactive advertising content (banner, advertising space, interactive offers, product or service recommendations, email, SMS, MMS) that We broadcast, depending on the screen of the recipient Member’s Terminal,
the content that the Member’s Terminal can display or read, depending on the graphics card and the viewing or reading software included in the Terminal.
3.3.
==========
SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING
As part of Our Services, We may create groups of Users from the Browsing Data.
In accordance with article 9.1 of the GDPR, Numberly undertakes not to use, for segmentation and targeting purposes, Personal Data that may disclose racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership, nor genetic, biometric and health data or data concerning the sexual life or sexual orientation.
