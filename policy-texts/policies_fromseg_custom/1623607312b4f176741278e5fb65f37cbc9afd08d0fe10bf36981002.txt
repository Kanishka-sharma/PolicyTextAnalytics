Online Interest-Based Ads
We work with digital advertising and marketing companies to provide you with ads that meet your interests and that enhance your experience with us.
These ads may be displayed on websites or device applications operated by us or third parties, and they may be based on information about your activities or preferences collected by us or third parties.
For example, if you visit another website and provide your ZIP code, you may see advertising for products available at The Home Depot Store near you on another website.
We work with third parties to monitor and optimize ad delivery so that you don’t receive the same ad too many times and to determine whether you were interested in the ads.
As noted above, these third parties collect information with their own cookies, pixels, and related tracking technology.
