The American Psychological Association (APA) is committed to maintaining your trust, values your privacy and recognizes the sensitivity of your personal information.
We work toward protecting the privacy of users of our website.
We have carefully crafted this privacy policy to address concerns you might have, and to assure you that if you give us personal information, we will treat it carefully and appropriately.
Basic Confidentiality Policy
Where personal information is required to use or interact with the APA website, it is our policy that this information — such as your name, postal or email address, or telephone number — is private and confidential.
The personal information you provide to APA is stored in a secure location, accessible only by appropriate staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provided it, such as to reply to a question or to send requested materials.
==========
We never provide members’ email addresses for third-party usage.
Members’ postal addresses may occasionally be shared with third parties to provide you with information relevant to your membership and/or career.
Release of Information to Third Parties
Personal information collected as a function of the APA website will not be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which you provided it or if such release is required by law.
The APA member and affiliate directories are available only to members and affiliates in a members-only section of the site.
All members’ and affiliates’ names are listed in the directory, but members have the option to suppress other information.
==========
Collection and Use of Information
The APA website requires individuals to provide certain personally identifiable information in order to use certain features and functions.
By providing such information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Policy.
The information you provide may include data you enter when establishing a personal profile, which is needed for activities such as saving searches, requesting alerts, establishing permalinks or purchasing something from APA.
This information may include contact information (such as name, postal address and email address) and financial information such as a credit card number, if you order products or services through the site.
==========
This information will be used to process that order and, if necessary, to contact you regarding the status of your order.
By placing such an order, you agree and acknowledge that your order may be processed, fulfilled or serviced by parties other than APA and you understand that such third parties are limited by APA in their use of the information provided to them.
APA may use your contact information to get in touch with you regarding the status of your membership, registration or any orders you may place.
You may also be contacted by APA or our agents regarding additional services and features, or we may request your feedback about your experience with APA.
If you prefer that we not use your contact information as described in this paragraph, please send an email with the subject line “Unsubscribe.”
==========
No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information
Our website does not track, collect or distribute personal information about visitors.
We regularly compile aggregate statistics that show the number of visitors to our site, the requests we receive for particular information on the site and the Internet service providers that those requests come from.
These aggregated statistics are used by internal APA technical support staff to improve the website in an ongoing effort to provide better information and services to the public.
Usage statistics in aggregate form are also provided to the institutions that license content that is delivered on the website.
==========
Cookies
APA websites use "cookies" to improve functionality and usability.
We use this information for planning, tracking and to improve the technical functions of our sites and products.
By using our products and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.

About cookies
Cookies are text files sent by Web servers to Web browsers and are stored on the user’s computer or mobile device.
If the browser is loading a page and the server requests the information stored in the cookie, the cookie is sent back to the server.
Cookies contain data about the user’s activities on the website, and can be used by Web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website, and to identify users returning to a website.
Cookies may be either "persistent" or "session" cookies.
A persistent cookie will remain valid until its set expiration date (unless deleted by the user).
==========
A session cookie will expire at the end of the user session, when the Web browser is closed.
How APA uses cookies
Cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies the user, but information that we store about the user may be linked by us to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
APA websites use the information we obtain from people’s use of our website through cookies for the following purposes:
To recognize the user’s computer when the user visits the website.
==========
To track some user actions during website navigation.
To improve the website’s usability.
To analyze the use of the website.
To administer the website.
To report click-through data to our advertisers.

Third-party Websites
The APA website may provide you with links to other websites, although we do not necessarily advise that you are linking to another website.
In the event that you choose to access such websites, APA is not responsible for any actions or policies of those sites.
Further, please note that the third party's privacy policy and security practices may differ from APA standards.
APA neither assumes responsibility for, nor does it control, endorse or guarantee any aspect of your use of the linked site.
==========
We recommend that you check the privacy policy of such a party before providing personally identifiable information to it.
Changes in Our Privacy Policy
APA reserves the right to make changes to our Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason without prior notice.
Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of our policies.
We may also contact you by email with changes.
Website Security
APA uses website security measures consistent with current best practices to protect its website, email and mailing lists.
==========
These measures include technical, procedural, monitoring and tracking steps intended to safeguard data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction.
Credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.
Member and purchaser information is a high priority and we use our own protective measures, as well as the capabilities of our software and hardware vendors.
==========
We realize there can be incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions, as almost every website, service and user encounters.
In those instances, our goals are to move quickly to isolate the problem, ensure or restore proper functionality and minimize any inconvenience to our users.
As appropriate and necessary, APA will notify the relevant authorities of these incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions of the APA website.
Please email any problems to Customer Service.
While we may not be able to respond to every report, we take each report seriously and will investigate it thoroughly.
