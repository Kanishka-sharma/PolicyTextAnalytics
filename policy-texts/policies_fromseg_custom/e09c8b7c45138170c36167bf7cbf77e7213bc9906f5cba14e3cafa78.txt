how OVGuide protects your privacy
OVGuide respects your privacy and does not collect any personal information that is not submitted by the user (such as submitting a site suggestion, premium sections, or sending a page to a friend).
In the event that we do obtain your e-mail address, it will only be used for administration purposes and will not be distributed to any third-party or subjected to commercial e-mail.
We will not send you any email unless you are requesting it.
OVGuide does distribute cookies on your personal computer, but we do not collect any personally identifiable information.
The purpose of these cookies is just to keep a person signed in while browsing the website and remember things, like what you are searching for on the site so we can populate search fields without having you enter the information all over again.
==========
Although OVGuide makes a very strong effort to prevent links on our site that may contain spyware, adware, or other malicious programs, we cannot always guarantee their exclusion.
When you click on a link, which takes you to another website, you assume all the risks in doing so, which is really not much different than the risk you take when clicking on a search engine results link on Google or Yahoo.
If you find a link that you feel is malicious please report it to us using our contact form.
