==========
Your continued use of the Website indicates your agreement to be bound by any and all subsequent modifications or revisions.
College Confidential will attempt to notify Website users whenever it modifies or revises the Terms of Service, Forum Rules and/or Privacy Policy, however, we reserve the right to make such modifications or revisions without prior notice to you.
College Confidential recommends that Website users review the most up-to-date version of the Terms of Service, Forum Rules and Privacy Policy periodically at www.collegeconfidential.com.
Eligibility  You represent and warrant that you are capable of entering into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations and warranties as set forth in the Terms of Service, Forum Rules and Privacy Policy.
==========
If you are under the age of 13 years of age, you must obtain permission from your parent or legal guardian before using the Website.
Please see our Privacy Policy.
==========
Registration and Your Identity  College Confidential seeks to maximize the utility of its forum to its members and visitors, and does not knowingly allow members to misrepresent themselves.
Once you register and create a user name, it cannot be changed.
==========
Multiple registrations by the same individual without written permission from College Confidential are not allowed.
Similarly, users are not permitted to share accounts; do not allow other individuals (registered or not) to post under your user name.
Re-registration by individuals who have been banned or denied posting privileges in the past is not allowed.
Individuals who misrepresent themselves (e.g., posing as a student or parent when they are not, claiming a false affiliation with a college, etc.), or who allow others to post under their user name, or who register with multiple identities, or who re-register after having been banned, will be reported to the abuse department of their internet and/or email service provider and may be subject to civil or criminal action depending on the nature of their violation.
==========
College Professionals  Some of our members may be admissions officials, administrators, or faculty at a college or university.
Occasionally, a member may falsely claim to hold such a position.
To protect our student and parent members, there are two ways that a higher education professional can post.
==========
First, that member can contact the forum administrator and present independently verifiable information as to personal identity and school; that individual can then receive "College Rep" status, which indicates that College Confidential has taken reasonable steps to verify the individual is from the claimed school.
The school must be identified publicly, although the individual's personal info will not be disclosed.
Second, if an individual prefers to remain anonymous, he or she will refrain from making claims (even if true) as to current or former position.
E.g., "I am (or was) an admissions officer at a selective liberal arts college" would not be permitted.
==========
Such members will still develop a reputation for expertise, of course, if their body of posts demonstrates their knowledge.
College Confidential members are advised NOT to publicly question the credentials of a new member claiming a university affiliation.
==========
Rather, they should call the post to the attention of the moderators or the administrator so that College Confidential policy may be explained and any necessary verification take place.
Personal Information  When using College Confidential, please be certain that anything you disclose does not compromise your personal safety.
==========
Do not create a user name that incorporates personally identifiable information.
Do not provide your name, phone number, social security number or any other personally identifying information to people you do not know.
Do not continue any conversation online that makes you feel uncomfortable.
==========
Please report any incidents of harassment or attempts to discover personal information to the moderators.
Moderation  College Confidential moderators and administrators may edit, move, and delete posts to make them more accessible or to bring them into compliance with our Terms of Services and Forum Rules.
If an edit changes the context or meaning of the post in any significant way, moderators will usually include a note that the post has been edited in the post itself.
==========
All moderation, however, is performed on a "best efforts" basis - each poster is fully responsible for his/her own posts, and each visitor is responsible for what he/she reads.
Offensive posts should be reported to the moderators, and every effort will be made to remove them as soon as possible.
==========
Out of respect for both moderators and policies, discussion of moderator actions and forum policies is welcomed via private message or e-mail; these issues are off-topic for the forums.College Confidential reserves the right at all times to disclose any information posted on the forums, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that in College Confidential's sole and absolute discretion are objectionable.
You acknowledge that College Confidential reserves the right to monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Website, including the forums, which information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
==========
Editing and Deleting Posts; Deleting Accounts  Posts are editable for a brief period following posting to allow correction of spelling errors, formatting, etc.
After that, members may not edit their own posts.
This prevents one member from editing an earlier post in a thread, rendering comments by others irrelevant or seemingly inaccurate.
We cannot edit or delete posts upon request; please do not ask.
==========
Doing so would destroy the integrity of our archive and consume a huge amount of manpower.
Therefore, please do not post personal data or other information that could prove to be a problem later.
==========
Once an account has been created, it cannot be deleted.
College Confidential reserves the right to deactivate an account, however, existing content will not be removed from the forums.
==========

Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages so some of the above limitations may not apply to certain users to the extent required by applicable law.
Applicable Law  We control and operate the Website from our offices in the United States of America.

Arbitration  All parties to these Terms of Service waive their respective rights to a trial by jury.
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Website shall be binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association.
==========
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against College Confidential in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding against the College Confidential.
(a) By using the Website, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.

You also give up your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding.
==========
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
==========
(b) Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against College Confidential (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Orange County, California.
You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
==========
No Waiver  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.
==========
Termination  College Confidential may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Website or the Website's services at any time.
College Confidential may restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Website and/or its services if we believe you are in breach of our Terms of Service, Forum Rules, Privacy Policy or applicable law, or for any other reason without notice or liability.
