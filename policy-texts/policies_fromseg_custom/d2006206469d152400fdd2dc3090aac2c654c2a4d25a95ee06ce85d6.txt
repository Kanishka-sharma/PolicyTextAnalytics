Policy Update
Note: www.oracle.com is the main gateway to Oracle Corporation on the Web, containing the general privacy policy for www.oracle.com.
Because we have tried to simplify your access to our privacy policy, this policy describes the potential use of visitor information throughout the Oracle.com Web site.
Parts of the site may make far less use of personal information than we have outlined in the policy, but we wanted to provide you with an inclusive statement of our practices.
==========
Outsourcing, Support and Consulting Services.
Oracle provides a separate policy providing more detail related to how we manage information we access as part of our network-based outsourcing, support and consulting services ("Hosted Services").
Hosted Services information does not include our direct customer information, but rather the information of our customer that we may access related to its customers, employees, partners, etc. as part of our Hosted Services.
A link to our Hosted Services privacy policy may be found at the end of this policy and in the paragraph referencing Hosted Services.
Two Oracle Web sites are excluded from this policy because they are too different in form and function to be accommodated in this policy.
==========
Those sites are: Think.com - a not-for-profit educational project that helps schools provide online learning environments for children;Exchange.oracle.com - An online commercial trading community, which includes hosted portals for other vendors, in which the main intent and benefit of the community is the exchange of information concerning business opportunities.
For your convenience, we have provided links to the Hosted Services, Think.com and Exchange.oracle.com Privacy Policies at the end of this policy.

Types of Data Collection
How Oracle collects Data related to our users:
Through automated means such as communications protocols and cookies
Registration screens and online forms
In the process of online purchases (transaction records) and sales inquiries
In e-mails sent to Oracle from users
Through offline communications and interactions
Oracle may also obtain data related to our users through third party sources of information, such as opt in lists.
Oracle may receive data from you as part of the communication connection itself - the standard electronic greeting between your computer, the network, and our servers.
This information often consists of network routing (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), date and time.
At this time our server will also query your computer to see if there are "cookies"1 previously set by Oracle.com to facilitate login or other site navigation procedures.
Some parts of the Oracle site use cookies to collect information about your use of the Web site and to facilitate return visits.
The information collected from cookies is tracked to enhance security and to improve the functionality of the Web site by avoiding duplicate data entry, facilitating navigation, and increasing the relevance of content.
Cookies on the site may collect the following information: a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information used to personalize the content that is shown, and membership information to access Oracle's online communities.
Some cookies used by Oracle.com may remain on the user's computer after they leave the Web site, but the majority are set to expire within 30 - 365 days2.
==========
There may be some cookies on certain tools (such as evaluator) that may be of longer duration.
Cookies may also be of benefit to you by creating a more streamlined login process, keeping track of shopping cart additions and preserving order information between sessions.
In the future, as we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that information provided to you will be the most relevant to your needs.
==========
Third Party Cookies: Oracle has engaged Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the website to help us administer our web site in order to constantly improve the web site quality.
Omniture uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of Oracle that will be listed under the domain 2O7.
net.
Omniture does not use cookies to relate website visitors to any personally identifiable information and provides Oracle with information about site usage that reflects individual behavior of visitors, but not their identity.
All data collected by Omniture on behalf of Oracle is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.
Omniture's privacy practices have been certified by TRUSTe and may be found at www.omniture.com.
==========
While we don't offer an opt-out on the site for cookies, browsers provide you with information and control over cookies.
You can set your Web browser to alert you when a cookie is being used.
You can also get information on the duration of the cookie, and to learn what server your information is being returned to.
You then have the opportunity to accept or reject the cookie.
Additionally, you may set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers.
Users may generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion.
To learn more about cookies and browser functionality relating to cookies please search for "cookies" in the help function of your browser.
==========
In order to provide maximum site utility, Oracle also uses a tracking technique that uses embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies.
Embedded URLs3 manifest themselves as plain text or encoded extensions to the URL that appears in the browser address or location toolbar.
This technology allows limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not identified to personal information and is not used beyond the session.
==========
While this increases your ability to surf the site, it does not replace the functionality or streamlining of cookies and may limit your use of many convenience features offered by the site.
In an effort to provide you with the most relevant Web site content and marketing materials, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage and marketing campaign responsiveness.
On the Web site, these technologies are used on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits as opposed to aggregate hits.
The site usage information collected by these technologies is associated with cookies and may provide personally identifiable information about site use by registered users of www.oracle.com.
This information is used to evaluate site content, navigability and composition as well as page response rates.
==========
When these technologies are used in e-mails, they provide information on when the e-mail was opened.
In e-mails, these technologies are used to evaluate marketing campaign relevance to the user and to update marketing lists.

Customization, Preferences and Opt-Out
Oracle allows you to self-select into communities, through the registration process, as a way to provide initial customization to the Oracle Web site.
There are also plans to provide more control over preferences and information delivery in the registration process.
Communications Choices.
Oracle recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products.
Oracle.com allows you to opt-out of e-mail marketing that may result from use of the site.
.

If you have any problems in using these opt-out mechanisms, please send an e-mail to privacy_ww@oracle.com, indicate opt-out in the subject line and specify what problem you have encountered in the body of the message.
There are a few limited exceptions to the opt-out, but notice is provided that the service includes certain communications.

==========
Third Party Permission-Based Lists.
On occasion, Oracle may use a third party permission-based list.
These are lists maintained by third parties that have received permission from their users to receive e-mails from other companies, such as Oracle.
We do not have access to the names on these lists as the third party that has the direct relationship with their user maintains the list and the opt-outs, removes, and unsubscribes to those lists.
We require that the list owners we use identify themselves as the mailers of the e-mail and provide appropriate opt-out mechanisms.
While we advise users of third party websites to avail themselves of the opt-out functionality provided in the particular e-mail, should you have trouble opting out, or should you wish to make us aware of any issues related to the mailing, you may contact us directly at any of the addresses provided below.
Information-Sharing Choices.
Oracle only shares information with selected companies after providing users with an ability to either opt-out of or opt-in to the sharing.
==========
There are limitations to such opt-outs/opt-ins: in the case of joint sale or joint events where the information goes to both Oracle and the other party at the same time, where the customer has requested follow up which involves Oracle partners, and as needed with third parties required to accomplish the transaction including delivery and credit card clearing services.
There may also be some cases of sharing by definition of the service - for example posting comments to a bulletin board or posting an opportunity to an exchange - that provides that information to all users.
Other cases may include attendance at educational or conference events where third parties and Oracle partners may be involved in providing services or sponsorship of a conference, seminar, training session, or event.
As we further develop our preference tools we will endeavor to have our partners join in their use to provide the user with a more seamless and streamlined environment.
Please contact us at privacy_ww@oracle.com if you believe you have mistakenly received information after opting-out or if you would like to opt-out of receiving information and have any trouble using the mechanisms provided on www.oracle.com or via an e-mail link.
