All ticket prices include additional service charges and handling fees as defined on each order.
SITE and its TICKET SELLERS are not directly affiliated with any performer, sports team, or venue; and SITE does not act as a primary sale box office, unless otherwise stated.

Orders.
Orders placed through SITE will be fulfilled by one of our network of participating TICKET SELLERS.
Contact information for the TICKET SELLER who fulfills USER's order (hereinafter known as "FULFILLER") will be provided to USER upon completion of the purchase process.
If this information is lost, USER may contact EventTicketsCenter@ticketnetwork.com to retrieve information about the order.

All sales are final.
Since tickets are a one-of-a-kind item and not replaceable, there are no refunds, exchanges or cancellations.
If an event is postponed, tickets will be honored for the rescheduled date.
New tickets will not need to be issued.
==========

EventTicketsCenter.com is not responsible for providing or securing this refund for USER.
Any shipping and handling charges are not refundable.
