LAST UPDATED:  JUNE 19, 2014
PubMatic, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, PubMatic Limited, PubMatic GmbH, PubMatic India Private Limited, PubMatic KK and PubMatic Pte. Ltd. ("we," "our," "PubMatic") offer a strategic selling platform to premium publishers, which enables them to optimize their digital assets while protecting their brands.
PubMatic's platform is designed to help publishers increase the amount of revenue they make from advertising sales by increasing the overall competition among media buyers for each advertising impression displayed through the PubMatic platform.
We are a publisher-focused company, but at the same time we maintain client relationships with media buyers.
Ads that you see come from those media buyers, and usually the ad comes from an ad server with the same domain as the media buyer.
Generally, a user will encounter an ad from one of our media buyers by viewing the content on a website or application owned or operated by one of our publishers.
