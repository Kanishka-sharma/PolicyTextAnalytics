User Information Privacy Policy
This User Information Privacy Policy describes how the web sites maintained by The Boston Globe and its affiliates - currently Boston.com, digitalMASS.com, and all sub-sections - collect and utilize users' personally identifiable information.
It is our policy that a user controls
What personal identifiable information is collected by The Boston Globe's web sites and
What the web sites can do with that information.
The web sites will not disclose a user's personally identifiable information to any third party without the user's express permission.
Information Not Collected:
A user can access our web sites and utilize many of their services without providing any information at all.
Nor do we follow a user's browsing path outside of our web sites.
==========
We do develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers.
The people that make it possible for the user to use Boston.com for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are.
We never tell our advertisers the identity of a user who saw or clicked on their advertisements unless the user has expressly given permission to do so.
==========
Information Boston.com Collects:
Optional registration:
If users wish to utilize certain services located on each of our web sites, they must register.
Those services currently include: 
Participation in contests
On-line placement and management of Classified advertisements
Use of Boston Globe subscriber services
Participation as a bidder, buyer or seller in an auction
On-line purchase of goods from The Globe Store
Engaging in other ecommerce transactions
E-mail products
The information collected when a user registers includes the user's e-mail address (account id), name, credit card number for ecommerce transactions and, in the case of hard goods purchases, his billing/shipping address information.
This transaction information is encrypted and retained in a database not on a web site.
==========
In the case of the Red Sox daily e-mail, age and gender information is also collected.
While registering, a user may also "opt out" of various e-mail notifications (see Opt Out Procedures below).
Auctions:
Boston.com offers an auction service, which allows users to buy and sell items.
==========
All actual transactions take place off-line.
Once an auction has closed, the winning bidder receives the email address and phone number of the seller.
The seller receives the same contact information about the winning bidder.
==========
Information concerning unsuccessful auctions and bids is not used or archived by Boston.com for any purpose.
Polling: 
Boston.com offers interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with others and see what the audience thinks about important issues.
Boston.com uses a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question but no personal identifiable information is required to do this "tagging."
Chat Rooms: 
Users have access to chat rooms and other public forums on Boston.com.
While no personal information need be disclosed to gain such access, users should understand that should they choose to disclose personal information in these areas, it will become public information.
"Pass it on" service:
A user can electronically forward a news story to someone else by clicking the link at the bottom of a story.
The user must provide his and the recipient's email addresses to inform  the recipient who sent the story and to address transmission errors.
A user has the option of supplying his name which is only used for the e-mail salutation.
None of this information is used for any other purpose.
==========
Surveys:
Occasionally Boston.com conducts user surveys to better understand our user community.
We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners.
When we conduct surveys, we may ask for personally identifiable information like name and specific address, but that information is handled by the web site in the same manner as information collected when a user registers (See Optional Registration above).
Contests and sweepstakes: 
Boston.com does offer contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information.
At a minimum, the required information includes name and email address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data.
The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an email notification that the entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients.
==========
Boston.com will divulge this information to:  
a contest sponsor, if a user expressly asks to receive additional information from the contest sponsor.
the contest administrator, if not Boston.com, and if the user expressly consents.
Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event.
==========
Usage tracking:
Boston.com does track usage patterns on our web site and breaks down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
However, we do not match this information with users' personally identifiable information.
Cookies:
A cookie is a small data file that a web site transfers to a user's hard drive when a user visits the web site.
A cookie file can contain  information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages visited.
The only personal information a cookie can contain is that which a user supplies.
A cookie can't read data off a hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
==========
Boston.com does not use cookies to store passwords or any other personal information about a user.
The user may, however, elect to provide information that he wants Boston.com to remember.
Users who are comfortable providing such information about themselves can access  enhanced services that we cannot offer to anonymous users.
==========
(See Optional Registration above for a list of such services.)
Internet use of one of these services will generate a cookie containing  an Account ID (e-mail address), so when a user later accesses the same or another service, he will not have to reenter his personally identifiable information.
Opt Out Procedures For Electronic E-mail: 
If a user chooses to register with Boston.com, the user can choose not to receive communications from 
Boston.com such as email newsletters announcing contests, new features and/or added value services
third parties who offer a product or service that we think would be of value to the user.
Correcting And Updating: 
Our web sites offer users the ability to correct or change at any time certain personal identifiable information (e-mail address, credit card information and mailing address) collected during registration.
==========
The instructions for doing this can be found in our Member Services area.
Users who are experiencing problems or who have any questions about how our services work can contact us at customersupport@boston.com.
Our web sites do not offer users the means to delete personal identifiable information associated with past use of the web sites' services.
