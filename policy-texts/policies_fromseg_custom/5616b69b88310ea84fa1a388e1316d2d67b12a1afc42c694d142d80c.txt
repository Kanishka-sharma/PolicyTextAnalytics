Some of the advertisements you see on the CBS Services are delivered by third parties who also collect information through their own cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies about your online activities, either on our Services or across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests.
These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and ad networks that may collect information about you when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.
CBS does not have access to the information these third parties may collect about your interests to deliver relevant advertising to you, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
==========
These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes.
Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), which offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored advertisements from member companies.
To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the NAI consumer opt out page.
Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites.
CBS is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
To learn more and make choices about interest-based advertisements from participating third parties, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page, Canadian DAA online choice page, European DAA online choice page and Australian DAA online choice page.
Also, on most mobile devices, you can install the DAA's AppChoices app to make choices about cross-app interest-based advertisements from participating third parties.

Also, we work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and DigiTrust Partners to collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and non-affiliated websites over time.
This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences.
DigiTrust is a non-profit, industry-wide collaboration of companies supporting a standardized user token in order to improve the consumer online experience.
To learn more about how DigiTrust collects and uses information for online advertising, please visit http://www.digitru.st/privacy-policy/.
You can opt-out of the collection of data in this way for interest-based advertising by visiting the DigiTrust opt-out page here or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s choice page and opting out from DigiTrust.
Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent a first-party cookie from being set in this way.

In addition, CBS works with third parties to help us track the advertisements that are delivered to you, in particular to control the number of times you receive the same advertisements, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising on the CBS Services.
Third parties that use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to help us with traffic measurement, research and analytics include Adobe, Comscore, Nielsen and ConfirmIT.
We do not share contact information with these third parties.
==========
If you opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Services, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.
On certain mobile devices, third parties may collect mobile device identification numbers (e.g. Apple’s Identifier for Advertising IP (IDFA) or Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID)) and may use this information in connection with other data about you (or that you have provided to parties other than us), including data regarding your use of websites, apps or other services over time to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests across these devices.
You may be able to opt out of such tailored advertisements through settings made available by mobile operating systems.
For example, Google Android settings may allow you to opt out of interest based advertising or Apple iOS settings may allow you to limit ad tracking.
