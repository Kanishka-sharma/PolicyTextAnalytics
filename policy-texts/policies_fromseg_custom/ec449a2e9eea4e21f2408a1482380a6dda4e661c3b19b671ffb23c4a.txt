==========
We also collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address and an anonymous device identifier, some of which may be considered "personal data" in some jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere, but none of this data identifies you individually.
On the Website, Tapatalk may automatically gather Non-PII that browsers automatically make available, including IP addresses, domain servers, types of computers accessing the Website, and types of web browsers accessing the Website.
In addition, the Application collects certain Non-PII automatically, including the type of mobile device, mobile operating system and mobile Internet browser you use, an anonymous mobile device identifier, the IP address of your mobile device, and information about the way you use the Application.

ADVERTISEMENTS; AD NETWORKS; OTHER THIRD PARTIES
We may allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of the Service.
Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include cookies and web beacons within our Website, or other tracking methodologies such as anonymous device identifiers on the Website and/or Application to collect anonymous information in order to provide customized content and/or ads, auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and advertisers when you visit certain pages of the Website or Application, and other websites or applications.
For example, because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party's web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their website directly.
When you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that these companies will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements.
==========
In addition, we or a data partner we have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use the Service or other websites or applications, or to seek to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers.
In order to customize these ads or content, we or our data partners may connect de-identified demographic or other data about you (received from third parties) either to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), or to data passively collected from you (such as your device identifier or IP address).
However, we will only share your email address with our data partner in hashed, non-human readable form.
The above third-party companies offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites.
To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at privacy@tapatalk.com.

Once you leave the Service via such a link, access a forum, a third party application or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the forum, third party, or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.
WIDGETS
We may include a widget from a third party on the Website or on the Application that allows interaction or content sharing by users.
"Widgets" are mini-programs that provide specific services or content from a third party.
These Widgets, such as a Facebook "Share" or "Like" button, may be visible to you on a forum page or entry you visit.
The third party providing the Widget may offer controls for you to manage the Widget's appearance and functionality.
==========
Your interaction with a Widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through the third party's cookies or its registration information.
In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its Widgets and cookies even when you do not interact with the Widget.
To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at privacy@tapatalk.com.
