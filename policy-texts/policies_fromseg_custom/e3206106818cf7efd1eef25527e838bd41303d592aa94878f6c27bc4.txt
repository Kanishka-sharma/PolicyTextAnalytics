Third Party Cookies
In addition to our own cookies, we work with various reputable companies to help us analyse how the Platform is used, and to optimise our Website and Apps to deliver the best possible experience.

Google Analytics and Google Web Optimizer are services provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”).

Similar Technologies
In addition to cookies, we also use the following standard Internet technologies in connection with your use of the Platform:


Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed into our email newsletters.
These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else.
This provides us with useful information regarding the effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is relevant to our users.
==========
Flash cookies:  We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players.
This ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts.
We do not use Flash cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any cookies that you might previously have deleted.
HTML5 Local Storage:  We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour.
If you access the mobile version of our website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences.
==========
We do not use HTML5 local storage to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.
Activity tracking:  We work with Mouseflow ApS ("Mouseflow") to help us understand which parts of our website are of most interest to website visitors.
Mouseflow does this by recording mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and certain text that users type in the Website (other than text typed in password fields), and aggregates this information into heat maps showing which areas our website generate the most activity.
==========
These reports are compiled on an aggregated basis and cannot be used to identify your individual web browsing activity.
Mouseflow only tracks activity on our homepage (http://soundcloud.com/) and our premium page (http://soundcloud.com/premium), and does not track your browsing habits across other websites.
For more information see Mouseflow’s Privacy Policy here.
If you don’t want Mouseflow to record anything from your browser, please see the Opting Out section below.
==========
Bug Reporting:  We work with Bugsense, Inc (“Bugsense”) and Bit Stadium GmbH (“HockeyApp”) to report any bug affecting our iOS and Android mobile apps.
Bugsense’s software is built into our iOS app and HockeyApp’s software is built into our Android app.
If either app crashes during normal use, the app will send certain information about the incident to Bugsense or HockeyApp as applicable.
This information includes your IP address, but does not include any information that could be used to identify you or your mobile device individually, and does not include any other information from your mobile device.

Please note that Bugsense does not store any information transmitted when a crash is reported.
