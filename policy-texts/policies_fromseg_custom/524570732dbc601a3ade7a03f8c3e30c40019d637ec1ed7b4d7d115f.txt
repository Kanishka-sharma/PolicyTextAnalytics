Healthline - Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy

Internet
privacy is an issue that we take very seriously and Healthline is
committed to protecting your privacy.
We believe it is important for
you
to know what information is being collected about you, how that
information is being used, with whom it is being shared, and how to
contact us if you have additional questions or concerns.
What information does Healthline gather/track, and how is it used?
==========
Information
gathered online can generally be categorized as either anonymous or
personally identifiable.
Anonymous information is information that
cannot
be traced back to a specific individual.
For example, Healthline knows
how
many searches are queried each day at each of its Web sites but does
not
know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of the people searching.
Even
after you have signed up for MyHealthline, we do not know your name or
email address when you are conducting searches.
Personally
identifiable information is information you provide that lets us know
specific facts about you so that we can customize the information
Healthline delivers to you accordingly.
This information can include
your
name, address, zip code, age, etc.
==========
It is our belief that you will find
it
beneficial to provide us with personal information so that your
experience
with Healthline is more satisfying.
Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information 

Each time a visitor comes to a Healthline web site, we collect some
information to improve the overall quality of
the online experience, including product monitoring, product
improvement,
and targeted advertising.
At the Healthline web site, we collect the
visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from aol.com
or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the
last
URL a user visited prior to clicking through to the Healthline web
site),
and browser and platform type (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0
browser on a
Windows XP platform).
In addition to collecting these types of
information, Healthline collects aggregate queries for internal
reporting
and targeted advertising.
We also count, track, and aggregate the
visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our
sites
(e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the
Healthline properties, etc.).
To these ends, we may merge information
about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated
basis
with our advertisers; but Healthline will not disclose your individual
identity or personal data without your permission.
When Healthline does
present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be
able
to identify or contact you.
==========
Use Of 'Cookies'

Healthline's web sites use cookies to monitor traffic
flow, patterns of travel within and through the sites, and to
dynamically
generate advertising and content.
Cookies are a standard Internet
technology that allows us to both store and retrieve login information
on
a user's system.
Our web server automatically asks a new user whether
his
or her browser will agree to accept a Healthline cookie file.
If a
visitor
accepts, our web server will identify the user's cookie for
Healthline's
use in internal reporting.
If a user accepts a Healthline cookie, but
would later like to remove it from his or her computer, he or she can
just
remove it from the browser.
Web Beacons

Some Healthline web pages use web beacons in conjunction with cookies
to
compile aggregate statistics about web site usage.
A web beacon is an
electronic
image, called an action tag, or single pixel (1x1), or clear GIF.
==========
Web
beacons
can recognize certain types of anonymous information (non-personally
identifiable information, or non-PII) on a visitor's computer, such as
a
visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a
description of the
page where the web beacon is placed.
You have the option to render some
web
beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
Third-party Media Companies

Healthline uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
visit
our web site.
Our advertising partners' Ad Server may use cookies when
you view

information as a
way of measuring the effectiveness of advertising sold on Healthline.
Our
sponsors and advertisers have agreed that they will not collect any
personally
identifiable information from our site visitors while they are on
Healthline.
If you click on an advertisement on Healthline and visit a site

one of our sponsors or advertisers, please be aware that we are not
responsible
for the privacy practices of those sites.
You should read the privacy
policies
of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be
collecting about you.
Some Ad Servers allow you to opt out of anonymous data collection
through the
use of cookies.
To do so, you must opt out of such data collection with
each
individual site.

such
events maintain the privacy of the registrants' information.
When
appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive information
from third-party organizations in connection with services or events
offered by Healthline.
This option may be made available through
Healthline 's registration and/or through registration processes
maintained by a participating third-party.
In all cases, you will be
informed before you register for the event of service that a third
party
will be receiving the registration information you provide, and you
will
have the option not to participate in any service or event that
requires
third party involvement.
With whom does Healthline share the information it gathers/tracks?
Healthline does not
provide third-party access to your personal information except in the
aggregate and only after the information has been de-identified.
The
information will be in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our
users' answers to survey questions and on-site behavior.
Healthline
will
not disclose the contact or demographic information of any individual
user
to advertisers or any other outside organization without the express
permission of the individual.
