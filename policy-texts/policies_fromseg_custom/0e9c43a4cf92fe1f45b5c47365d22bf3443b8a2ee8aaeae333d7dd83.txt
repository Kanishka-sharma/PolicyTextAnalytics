OkCupid takes appropriate precautions to protect our users� information.
Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.
Because email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication, we request that you do not send private information to us by email.

OkCupid cannot ensure that your identity, telephone number, work or home address and other personal identifying or contact information will not be discovered by other users of the Web Site.
This is particularly true because your location (within a radius of approximately five miles) will be revealed.
It is, of course, more likely that your true identity will be discovered if you post photographs or share other unique identifying information about yourself on public areas of the Web Site.
