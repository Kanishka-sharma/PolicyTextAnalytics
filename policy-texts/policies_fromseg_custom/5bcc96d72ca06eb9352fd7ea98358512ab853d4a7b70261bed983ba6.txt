1- WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT?
As part of our business as a SSP, Adagio collects and uses several
        categories of data that are strictly necessary in order to provide its
        services.
Specifically, the information Adagio collects generally includes: Your IP address.
Adagio needs your IP address in
          order to provide its services.
Adagio only uses your complete IP
          address if you agreed to it; otherwise, only a fully anonymized
          version of the IP address will be used.
==========
Your approximate location.
Adagio also uses User’s
          approximate location such as the country or the city location based
          on the User’s IP address.
The collection of the User’s IP address is
          only processed to locate you geographically without other precise
          location than your country for your city.

          any precise geolocation and does not collect the GPS Users’
          position.
==========

          know that you, as a User, share your proper and updated consent to
          the data controller in order to provide our service with the right
          legal basis.
The context Analysis Data.
==========
This information
          includes several technical information on the device you use, the
          “user agent” containing information related to your browser, your
          exploitation system, the page types accessed, and the size of the
          screen.

        with one another) in order to relate to an identified or identifiable
        user.

        directly by using cookies or similar technologies, but Adagio receives

==========
Publishers are responsible for the
        Consent Management Platforms (Hereafter the “CMP”) settings and the
        Users’ consents collection.

        (websites’ publishers or media sellers acting on behalf of
        Publishers).

        its data is accessible here.
In the digital advertising sector, Publishers use SSPs’ technologies
        to better monetize their advertising spaces.
==========
In that context, there
        are exclusive deals between the Publishers and technical providers
        such as Adagio even on an identified inventory in specific agreements
        such as the private deals.
Therefore, the list of the Adagio
        Publishers might change on a regular basis and cannot be exhaustive
        because of the media selling business structure.

==========
Adagio markets technological solutions for attention trading based on
        proprietary tools allowing to predict the exposure of advertising
        spaces and how long each advertising impression will be viewable.
These innovative solutions have, in particular, the benefits of
        optimizing the monetization of Publishers' advertising spaces.
In that context the data is used for the following purposes: to perform Adagio SSP services to Publishers; to improve Adagio technology; to perform in advertising and predict the attention on an ad.
Adagio is authorized to perform on behalf of Publishers all processing
        necessary to execute the agreement when it acts as data processor of
        Publishers.

        above all processings necessary for the execution of the agreement and
        in particular the collection, the recording, the storage, the
        adaptation, the modification, the extraction, the consultation, the
