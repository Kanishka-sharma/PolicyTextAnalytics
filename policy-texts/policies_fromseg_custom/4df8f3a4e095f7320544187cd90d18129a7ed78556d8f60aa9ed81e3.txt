Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic 
                                                image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or 
                                                in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web 
                                                site or sending the e-mail.
When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a 
                                                site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such 
                                                as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web 
                                                beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image 
                                                and previously set cookie values.
Web Beacon - Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear 
                                                GIF.
We use pixels tags or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online 
                                                advertising and promotions.
==========
These tags collect anonymous (not personally 
                                                identifiable) information about which advertisements and promotions bring users 
                                                to our website.
With both cookie and tag technology, the information that we 
                                                collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not 
                                                contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a 
                                                site.
A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and 
                                                looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the 
                                                site.
Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking 
                                                the user's activity.
The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, 
                                                but the user's unique information will not be recorded.

                                                Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
We care about the safety of 
                                                children.
We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any 
                                                personally identifying information.
Children under 13 years of age are required 
                                                to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any

  - (Top)


                                                At FWH, children’s privacy is important to us.
Therefore, we take additional 
                                                measures to help children protect their privacy while online including not 
                                                asking them to disclose more personally identifiable information than is 
                                                necessary for them to participate in an activity and encouraging them to use 
                                                non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names.
FWH is dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal 
                                                information we obtain from you with care and respect.
This Children's Privacy 
                                                Statement is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies 
                                                and principles with respect to children under the age of 13.
FWH recognizes the 
                                                need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit our website 
                                                at www.subway.com.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform 
                                                parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal 
                                                information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent 
                                                of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use 
                                                certain features of our website.
Also, when we use the term "parent", we mean to 
                                                include legal guardians.
Children can participate in many of our features without providing personally 
                                                identifiable information.
However, to enable their participation in certain of 
                                                our interactive features, we may ask children to provide us with personally 
                                                identifiable information.
The types of information we may request include first 
                                                name as well as the child’s and parent’s email addresses.
We use a child’s email 
                                                address to respond to a specific request to participate in an activity (e.g., 
                                                participate in a contest or sweepstakes, respond to their question, enable them 
                                                to subscribe to a newsletter).
We use parents’ e-mail addresses to obtain their 
                                                consent or notify them of their child's online activities and enable the parent 
                                                to unsubscribe the child from a newsletter or other similar activity.
We do not share children's personally identifiable information with outside 
                                                third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy.
Sometimes, we use agents or 
                                                contractors to help us conduct a contest or sweepstakes, send prizes to winners, 
                                                or provide customer service related to activities on the site.
In these cases, 
                                                we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to 
                                                use it only for the specific services they are performing.
==========
At any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal 
                                                information from their child and can request that any personal information we

We 
                                                require our affiliates within the SUBWAY® Group and their Development Agents to

By applying to become a SUBWAY® franchisee, a prospective 
                                                franchisee consents to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal 
                                                Information in accordance with the following terms and conditions.
We collect

                                                applying to become a SUBWAY® restaurant franchisee and to assist our affiliates 
                                                within the SUBWAY® Group in selecting franchisee candidates.

                                                litigation history, and taxpayer identification number.
Failure to provide 
                                                requested Personal Information may negatively impact a prospective franchisee’s 
                                                ability to become a franchisee.
Once a prospective SUBWAY® restaurant franchisee 
                                                becomes a franchisee, they may then reference themselves by their Franchise 
                                                Agreement Number.
In order to better service franchisees, a franchisee’s

In order to effectively implement the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program, and to provide 
                                                purchasing services to members, a franchisee’s Personal Information may be 
                                                shared with an independent purchasing cooperative or other independent third 
                                                party.
The Personal Information shared with the independent purchasing 
                                                cooperative shall include, but will not be limited to: name, address, credit 
                                                card information, and other related information necessary for billing purposes, 
                                                such as a mailing address for credit card validation, and bank account 
                                                information, you provided to FWH to establish your pre-authorized account for 
                                                the payment of royalties, advertising fees, and other charges.
Subject to a 
                                                franchisee’s agreement with the independent purchasing cooperative, the 
                                                independent purchasing cooperative may bill a franchisee’s bank account for fees 
                                                and other costs associated with the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program.
If a franchisee 
                                                does not wish to disclose this information, they must notify the Privacy Officer

                                                Layers or SSLs), password protection, and other security measures to help

                                                Safe Harbor requirements regarding the transfer of personal information from the 
                                                European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland to the United States.
FWH has been 
                                                Self-Certified under the Safe Harbor privacy frameworks as set forth by the U.S. 
                                                Department of Commerce, European Commission and Switzerland regarding the 
                                                collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of personal data 
                                                transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to the U.S., in 
                                                accordance with the EU Directive on Personal Data Protection.
The principles of 
                                                Safe Harbor compliance are:

Notice - Individuals must be informed that their data is being 
                                                    collected and about how it will be used;
Choice - Individuals must have the ability to opt out of the 
                                                    collection and forward transfer of the data to third parties;;
Onward 
													Transfer - Transfers of data to third parties may only occur to other 
                                                    organizations that follow adequate data protection principles;
Security - 
													Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss of collected information;
Data 
													Integrity - Data must be relevant and reliable for the purpose for 
                                                    which it was collected;
Access - Individuals must be able to access information held 
                                                    about them, and correct or delete it if it is inaccurate;
Enforcement - 
													There must be effective means of enforcing these rules.
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you 
                                                to countries other than the country in which the information was originally 
                                                collected.
Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the 
                                                country in which you initially provided the information.
When we transfer your 
                                                information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in
