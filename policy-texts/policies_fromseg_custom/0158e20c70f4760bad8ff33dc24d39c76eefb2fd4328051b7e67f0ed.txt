Privacy Policy
Last modified: October 30, 2018
As a user of services offered by Uniregistrar Corp. d/b/a “Uniregistry” under license by Uniregisty, Corp., or any of its subsidiaries or authorized affiliates (“We”, “Us”, “Our”) or a visitor to the Uniregistry.com website, you provide us with information about you and the way you use our website.
As we use the term in this Privacy Policy, the information that we collect about you is called “Personal Data.”
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what Personal Data we collect so you can decide whether or how you will use our services or the tools you use to access our website.
This Privacy Policy affects your rights in and to your Personal Data.
It does not provide you with privacy in data which is falsified, stolen, or misappropriated from other persons.
==========
When you provide us with Personal Data, you warrant that it is accurate, reasonably current, or expressly authorized by any other party for whom you are acting as an expressly authorized agent.
This Privacy Policy explains: what Personal Data we collect and why that Personal Data is collected; how we use and/or retain the Personal Data we collect; and, how you may update, keep current, and limit the distribution of Personal Data in our possession.
Our primary location is in the Cayman Islands, but we use servers and third-party services outside the Cayman Islands to store, serve and transfer information and manage our services, including services that rely on the use of your Personal Data.
In providing services to you, your Personal Data necessarily crosses international boundaries.
==========
We work hard to protect our systems and you from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Personal Data we hold.
Specifically, we encrypt many of our services to provide you secure access to our site and your information.
We also offer you the ability to enable two-step verification for access to your account.
We review our Personal Data collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
==========
We restrict access to Personal Data to our employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
We intend to maintain our services in a manner that protects Personal Data from accidental or malicious destruction.
Because of this, after you delete Personal Data from our services, we may retain your Personal Data for a period of time sufficient to investigate suspected incidents of unauthorized access to your account, malicious destruction of data, legal disputes or instances of abuse.
==========
Information We Collect In Providing Our Services To You
We collect Personal Data we need in order to provide you the services you have purchased from us.
Many of our services require you to sign up for an account using your real name and accurate contact information.
When you sign up for an account, we will ask for personal information, including your name, postal mailing address, email address, and telephone number.
To make purchases, we will ask you for your payment information, such as your credit card information required by payment processing services to transact your payments to us.
==========
Within your account, we provide you with access to your Personal Data used to conduct transactions through the account.
For the Personal Data we have for you, we provide tools for you to use to update your information quickly or to delete it from further use.
When updating your Personal Data, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
==========
Domain Registration
Domain registration is the service of authoritatively and securely establishing you as the registrant of a domain name.
In order to do so, we must inherently be able to identify and confirm you as the registrant of any domain name you have registered with us, and we must have your contact information in order to notify you of expirations and to confirm changes to your domain registration such as, renewals, transfers, or updates to your contact information.
To protect against identity fraud we may contact you to confirm the accuracy of information you have provided to us, and we require that you provide redundant means of contacting you, such as by email, telephone or postal mail, to confirm that your contact information is accurate, and/or to investigate whether your contact details may have been subject to misappropriation or identity fraud.
The provision of inaccurate or false contact information to us may result in the suspension or cancellation of your services.
==========
We also collect personal data we are contractually required to collect by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”), other domain name registry providers, credit card and payment providers, and third-parties that provide services, such as email and web hosting, that we offer to you in conjunction with our domain registration services.
The applicable TLD registry, whether under the authority of ICANN or the applicable ccTLD manager, may impose additional or different data retention requirements as a condition of our being able to offer domain registration services to you.
In order to safeguard your domain name registration in the event of catastrophic failure or other inability to continue to provide domain name registration services to you, we are required to use an ICANN-accredited data escrow provider, so that your services can be transferred to another provider.
When you register your domain name, we will identify your domain name as having been registered through us in public WHOIS data.
If you desire to be publicly identified as the registrant of your domain name, we provide the option of having your personal data included in the public WHOIS data.
If you are an organizational registrant, the name of your organization will be included in the public WHOIS data.
==========
By default, we will provide users of our WHOIS system the ability to use a web form to contact you about your domain name.
We will collect and forward information submitted by users of the web form to your email address.
We will maintain a temporary log of metadata about use of the web form by visitors for diagnostic and abuse monitoring purposes, such as in the event we are unable to forward information to the email address you have provided to us.
When you provide contact information to us for registration, transfer, or updates to your registration data, you warrant that such information is accurate.
For any domain name for which you are acting as agent for an organization or other person, you warrant that you have the express consent of such organization or person to provide us with the registration data.
==========
If you are unable to provide such consent, or if such party should indicate no such consent exists, we may suspend, cancel or otherwise discontinue your services.
When you select us to configure third party services for use with your domain name, we will ask you for access credentials to those third party services for the sole purpose of performing the configuration of them which you requested us to perform.
We will not store or retain your access credentials for longer than necessary to perform such third party service configuration.
At all times, you may access your personal data through your account interface in order to update or correct your personal data.
We will maintain your data only as long as needed in order to perform our services to you or to enforce any contractual dispute which may arise under our agreement to provide services.
==========
Uniregistry Marketplace Services
When you engage our Uniregistry Marketplace services, we will ask for information enabling us to credit, deposit or wire money to your receiving account.
In order to update you about inquiries received, negotiate terms, or transact a contracted domain transfer from you to another party under the terms of our Uniregistry Marketplace services we will need to reach you via your contact information.
If you have inquired to purchase a domain name through the Uniregistry Marketplace or domain brokerage service, we will ask you to provide contact information to us, so that we may update you about your your inquiry, negotiate terms of transfer, and transact a domain transfer to you in the event that an agreement is reached to transfer a domain name to you.
==========
If you are no longer interested in having us contact you about your inquiry, our communications to you include an "opt out" link to discontinue any further communications.
In the event a legal dispute may arise between the parties to a proposed Uniregistry Marketplace transaction, each of the parties will be provided with the other party's contact information, so that they may seek appropriate resolution of the dispute.
If you have opted out of further contact we will retain your contact information and communications conducted in connection with your inquiry only as long as may be necessary in order to resolve any dispute which may arise from your inquiry, such as failure to perform an agreed transfer.
==========
Parked Pages
Domain Names parked with us display internet search advertisements which are provided by a third party search advertising provider.
The advertisements provided when you conduct a search through one of our parked pages includes remarketing advertising.
This program allows relevant advertisements to be provided to users of internet search systems.
Through participation in this program, we permit third-party vendors, including Google, to display advertising on websites across the Internet.
Google uses cookies to present our advertising messages to certain Internet users when those users are visiting third-party websites.

When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing.
In the event your account has been subject to identity fraud or abuse, we will retain all such reports and account information necessary to investigate such circumstances.
We do not share Personal Data with companies, organizations and individuals outside of our organization unless one of the following circumstances applies:
With your consent: We will share Personal Data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our company when we have your express consent to do so.
For external processing: We provide Personal Data to our partners and other trusted businesses, such as credit card processing companies, to process your Personal Data for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
For legal reasons: We will share Personal Data with other companies, organizations or individuals if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
==========
We will retain all contact information and data associated with any threat of legal action against us, and we will use such information to initiate or defend against any legal action associated with such threats.
Likewise, if you we cancel your services for violations of our Terms of Service or for any abusive or unlawful activity, we will retain such information as may be necessary to prevent or block your use of our services in the future.
Legitimate Access
We will comply with applicable law and domain dispute policies concerning the disclosure of your information to third parties who may request it for legitimate purposes.
If you are a third party requester of personal data of one of the users of our service, we cannot provide you with such data absent lawful process for access to that data.
==========
The Cayman Islands is a signatory to several relevant multi-lateral and bi-lateral international agreements concerning the service of legal process in civil disputes (such as the Hague Service Convention), and the service of warrants and investigative requests in criminal matters.
If you are unfamiliar with the procedure for obtaining legal assistance in civil or criminal matters, you may consult such Cayman Islands Government publications as the Cayman Director of Public Prosecutions guide, "Seeking Assistance In Criminal And Civil Matters From The Cayman Islands" here or the Cayman Islands' Handbook on International Cooperation & Information Exchange here.
We will comply with any duly-served document under the relevant civil or criminal procedure established in the Cayman Islands for such purposes.
The provisions of this section on Legitimate Access shall not prevent us from our own investigation and/or reporting of violations of our terms of service, abuse of our services, attacks on our systems, identify fraud, theft of services, or other unlawful or abusive activity, whether we become aware of such circumstances on our own, or whether it is reported to us by a third party.
We will forward third party abuse reports to you to address claims of unlawful or abusive activity associated with your account except in circumstances where it is clear to us that doing so would further advance or promote such activity.
==========
Enforcement
We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy.
When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up.
In order to do so, we must necessarily retain sufficient information concerning the complaint in order to address and resolve the complaint.
==========
Changes
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
