Most of the internet is offered to users free of charge.
Web publishers are able to offer valuable content for free because they are supported by advertising.
Acuity aims to create a better browsing experience for web users by allowing advertisers to present relevant advertising content, rather than advertising that is unrelated to users’ interests.
Advertisers also benefit because targeted advertising is more effective and better received.We take your privacy seriously.
We are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adhere to its Code of Conduct, as well as the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada’s (DAAC) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Device IDs are accessible by Publishers and can be passed to Acuity with an ad request.
These Device IDs do not enable Acuity to identify individuals, but rather can be used for certain advertising purposes.
It can be used to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same device, track a device to show that the device interacted with an ad (i.e. “clicked” on it, watched a video ad, or downloaded an application as a result of an advertisement).
If Acuity stores a Device ID, it would be for these advertising administrative purposes, and would not be used to create profiles of end-users over time.Acuity may also partner with third parties that have their own methods of identifying a device.
These can be used as described above, or in some cases can be used for the purposes of supporting 3rd party targeted advertising solutions.
