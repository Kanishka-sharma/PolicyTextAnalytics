Sharing of Information
We do not sell, trade, share or rent your personal information to third parties except to provide products, services and content you’ve requested, when we have your consent or under the following circumstances:
In the process of fulfilling your order or providing services, 6Sense may by necessity provide some of your information to third parties.
We may occasionally employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf for business purposes.
Examples could include, without limitation, processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, providing services, gathering or analyzing data and providing marketing assistance.
These companies will have access to your personal information only to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose.
==========
6Sense could utilize targeting criteria in displaying advertisements based on personal information.
6Sense will not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view an ad.
However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
6Sense may use the information we collect in connection with your use of our services (including your personal information) in order to investigate, enforce, and apply our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
==========
We may share your personal information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control that we may have now or in the future, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.
In the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition by a non-Affiliate or dissolution, personal information could be shared or become one of the transferred assets.
Any use of personal information by such third party transferee would then be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy or the transferee’s privacy policy.
6Sense may disclose your personal information if we believe we are required to do so by law, court order, subpoena from a court with proper jurisdiction, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation by a governmental authority or agency.
==========
We do not collect sensitive personal information (such as medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of an individual), but if we were to do so, we would require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
