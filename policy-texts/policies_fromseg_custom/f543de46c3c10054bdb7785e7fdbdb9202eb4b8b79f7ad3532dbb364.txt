Forwarding of personal data to third parties




At the beginning of this privacy statement we explained to you for which purposes we process your personal data.
==========
We are an internationally organized company and part of the Amadeus Group.
This entails that we have to forward your personal data to third parties in order to provide optimum services for you.
This shall also include a cross-border exchange of personal data.
==========
This is decisive for the provision of our services.
Third parties, to which we transmit data are:

Business partners, suppliers, subcontractors and service providers for the execution of a contract, which we have concluded with these companies or with you.
In order to prove your identity towards all persons, to whom you send messages with information relating to the website directly via the website.
To sponsors of advertising actions (irrespective whether the advertising actions are organized by us) or otherwise in compliance with the rules applicable for the respective advertising action.
You should read the rules, if available, of each advertising action, in which you take part, carefully as under certain circumstances they contain important additional information about the use of your personal data by sponsors or third parties.

==========
It is of upmost importance to us particularly that your personal data are stored and transmitted in a secure manner.
For this reason we only transmit data outside of the European Economic Area or the EEA (i.e. the member states of the European Union as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) if this complies with the data protection law and the channel for the transmission offers appropriate protection for your personal data.
This is the case:

if a data transmission agreement is available, which includes the current standard contractual clauses, which the European Commission envisages for the transmission of personal data by responsible parties in the EEA to responsible parties and contract processors in legal systems without appropriate data protection law, or
by the signing of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for the transmission of personal data from companies in the EU to companies in the USA or an equivalent agreement between other legal system, or
the transmission of your data to a country, in which a standard of data protection exists as stipulated by law that was assessed as appropriate by the European Commission, or
if it is necessary for the conclusion or the processing of a contract between us and a third party and the transmission is in your interest for the purpose of this contract (for example if we must transmit data outside of the EEA in order to fulfill our obligations from this contract if you are a customer of our company), or
if you have granted your consent for the data transmission.
In order to ensure that your personal data enjoy an appropriate degree of protection we have implemented suitable measures with third parties with which we share your personal data in order to ensure that your personal data are processed by these third parties in a manner that is consistent with the data protection rights that is in line with the data protection laws.

Security


In order to guarantee the protection of the personal data controlled by us, we take all organizational, technical and administration-related measures to a reasonable extent.
Unfortunately, no 100% security can be guaranteed for data transmissions via the internet or for data storage systems.
==========
Please do not send us any confidential information by e-mail.
If you have cause to assume that your interaction with us is no longer secure (if, for example, you are convinced that the safety of an account, which you have set up in our company, is no longer guaranteed), you must inform us of the problem without delay by contacting us using the contact information on the website (please note that if you contact us by normal post the processing of your problem by us may be delayed).
Moreover, please note that the communication by e-mail is not inevitably secure.
Accordingly, you should not enter any credit card information in your e-mail correspondence with us.
==========
Duration of the storage / deletion



We have explained to you above for the respective individual case how long we store your personal data and when we delete them.
In general we will store your personal data during a deadline, which is required in order to fulfill the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer storage deadline is necessary or is permitted by virtue of the law.
If the purpose of the storage ceases to apply or if a storage deadline expires that is stipulated by the European body for the issue of Directives and Regulations or another responsible legislator, the personal data will be blocked or deleted as a routine and in compliance with the statutory regulations.
