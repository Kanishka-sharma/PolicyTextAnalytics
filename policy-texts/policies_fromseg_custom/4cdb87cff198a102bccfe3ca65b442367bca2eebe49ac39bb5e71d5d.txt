Parsely, Inc. ("Parse.ly", "we," "us," or "our"), is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
Our Parse.ly Service allows customers to track usage and activity on websites and applications on a non-personal basis; to perform analytics related to the tracking; and, to store, query, aggregate, and export data related to the tracking (the "Parse.ly Service").
The Parse.ly Service powers several Parse.ly products that go by names such as Parse.ly Analytics, Parse.ly Currents, Parse.ly Dashboard, Parse.ly Video Analytics, Parse.ly Mobile App, Parse.ly Overlay, Parse.ly SDK, Parse.ly Data Pipeline, Parse.ly API, and other such names, as detailed on our website at https://www.parse.ly (the "Site").
We have created this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") in order to demonstrate our commitment to you ("you" or "your"), our users, regarding your privacy with respect to information that you submit to Parse.ly or that we collect about you through the Site or via the Parse.ly Service.
As a general rule, there are two categories of users of the Site and Parse.ly Service: Our "Customers", who are operators or publishers of websites and applications that integrate the Parse.ly Service ("Customer Sites"), and "Visitors", who are visitors to our Site or who are visitors to Customer Sites integrating the Parse.ly Service and about whom we may receive Personal Information from our Customers.
==========
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information of any kind that we collect by means (including offline means) of or from sources other than those specified herein.
Because we gather important information from Customers and Visitors of the Site and Customer Sites, as well as related services provided by Parse.ly (collectively, the "Services"), we have established this Privacy Policy as a means to communicate our information collection, use, and dissemination practices.
In order to access and use the Services, you must agree to our Site Terms of Service at https://www.parse.ly/site-terms (applicable to all Visitors) and our Product Terms of Service at https://www.parse.ly/product-terms (applicable only to Customers) (the "Terms").
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in the Terms.
==========
As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information or set of information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
"Personal Information" does not include information that is not associated with an identified or identifiable individual or information that is reported in the aggregate (provided that such aggregated information is not identifiable to a natural person or household), and does not include information as to which identifying characteristics have been removed without means reasonably likely to be used by any person to re-identify the natural person or household, directly or indirectly.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" encompasses both "personal data" under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and "personal Information" under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA").

CHOICE
(Disclosing Personal Information to Third Parties)
Parse.ly will offer you the opportunity to choose whether your Personal Information is to be used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
==========
Parse.ly does not request or knowingly receive or collect Sensitive Personal Information.
Nonetheless, if at any point in the future Parse.ly receives or collects Sensitive Personal Information about you, Parse.ly will not process such information about you for purposes other than those for which the information was originally obtained or subsequently authorized by you unless you explicitly consent to the processing, or as required or permitted, or where not prohibited by law or regulation.
"Sensitive Personal Information" means Personal Information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data where processed to uniquely identify a person, any information that concerns medical or health conditions or sex life, or information relating to the commission of a criminal offense.
Parse.ly may disclose your Personal Information: To third-party vendors or service providers who help us provide the Services or the Site, including database hosting and data processing services, and assist us in responding to requests by you for information that you request (including your rights covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy); To third parties to whom you ask us to send your information; To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), provided that we require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy; To a company that merges with us, acquires us, or purchases our assets, in which case such company may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; or If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms; (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity or in connection with our own investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, in which case we may (and you hereby authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties; or (d) to prevent physical harm to an individual or financial loss.
==========
Opting Out of Collecting Information About You on Customer Sites
(For Visitors to Customer Sites)
When Visitors visit our Customer Sites, we may process information about you that is provided to us by our Clients.
If you prefer that we do not process Personal Information about you on Customer Sites provided to us by our Clients, please click here, or contact us as set forth in the "Contact Us" section.
==========
CLICK HERE TO OPT OUT OF PARSE.LY TRACKING.
Please note that this opt-out link sets a persistent cross-site cookie (also called a "third-party cookie") that instructs our standard integration module for the Parse.ly Service not to store information related to your usage.
However, you may find it more convenient to leverage a tracking-protection service to opt out of our Parse.ly Service tracking.
==========
This is because, for technical reasons related to the default configuration of the software of third parties that we cannot control, our opt-out link does not work in every browser, operating system and device environment.
To more effectively opt-out of Parse.ly tracking, you may use a "tracking script blocking tool", such as the "Tracking Protection" feature provided by the open-source Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Similar tools exist for mobile applications and other browsers.
To block Parse.ly tracking using these tools, you may blacklist these domains: p1.parsely.com and pixel.parsely.com (legacy).
==========
Opting Out of Marketing Communications
If you receive marketing or promotional emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email or by sending an email to the address provided in the "Contact Us" section.
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONWARD TRANSFER
In the performance of our Services and business operations, Personal Information we collect or receive may be stored or transferred internationally throughout our organization and to our service providers or agents, in accordance with applicable data privacy laws.
==========
Transfers to third parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy under Notice and Choice.
Parse.ly will endeavor to obtain assurances that any such service provider or agent will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and, with respect to any Personal Information of EU individuals in the EEA and Switzerland and Swiss citizens, the Privacy Shield Principles (see below), and will notify Parse.ly if it makes a determination it can no longer meet this obligation.
Where Parse.ly knows that any third party to whom it has provided Personal Information is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, Parse.ly will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.
With respect to such onward transfers to agents, and to the extent Parse.ly is responsible for the event, Parse.ly will remain liable should its agents process Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles (where applicable) and this Privacy Policy.
==========
DATA SECURITY
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information we process, Parse.ly maintains appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information in our possession against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing.
This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection, encryption, and other access and authentication controls.
==========
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk.
We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
==========
If you believe your Personal Information has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the "Contact Us" section.
We have a security incident response program designed to promptly respond to and escalate any potential privacy or security incident.
If we learn of a security incident, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.
==========
DATA INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE LIMITATION
Parse.ly endeavors to use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the Individual.
Parse.ly will take reasonable steps designed to ensure that only Personal Information that is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained is used by Parse.ly for as long as Parse.ly retains possession of such information.
Parse.ly's Personnel have a responsibility to assist Parse.ly in maintaining accurate, complete, and current Personal Information.
When acting as a provider of Services to its Customers on Customer Sites, Parse.ly endeavors only to process Personal Information that is relevant to its Services, and for purposes compatible with those for which the Personal Information was collected; wherever possible, such Personal Information is non-identified.
==========
ACCESSING AND CONTROLLING YOUR INFORMATION
Data protection laws (notably, the GDPR and the CCPA) make a distinction between organizations that process Personal Information for their own purposes (known as "controllers" (under the GDPR) and/or "businesses" (under the CCPA)) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors" (under the GDPR) and/or "service providers" (under the CCPA)).
If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Information is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant controller (or business), since the controller (or business) has primary responsibility for your Personal Information.
For Visitors to Customer Sites: When Parse.ly acts as a provider of Services to its Customers on Customer Sites, we are a processor (under the GDPR) and/or service provider (under the CCPA) in respect of Personal Information about Visitors to Customer Sites that Customers provide us.
We have no direct relationship with Visitors to Customer Sites, and any such Visitors who seek access, or who seek to correct, amend, or delete their Personal Information should direct their inquiries to the relevant Customer which has transferred such Personal Information to Parse.ly for processing.
We will assist our Customers in fulfilling their obligations under applicable law to respond to such requests by individuals to access, correct or amend, delete, restrict processing of or port their Personal Information.
==========
For Visitors to Our Site: We are a data controller (under the GDPR) and/or business (under the CCPA) in respect of Personal Information that Customers provide us as part of their accounts and Visitors provide us when visiting our Site.
Under laws in certain countries and US states in which Parse.ly operates, Customers who manage their accounts through our Service and Visitors to our Site from those countries/states have a right to access Personal Information about themselves, and to amend, correct or delete Personal Information that is inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated or restrict processing of or port their Personal Information.
==========
Parse.ly will, upon request, provide you with confirmation regarding whether Parse.ly is processing Personal Information about you, consistent with applicable law.
In addition, upon your request, Parse.ly will take reasonable steps to correct, amend, or delete your Personal Information that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete or processed in a manner non-compliant with this Privacy Policy or applicable law or restrict processing of or port your Personal Information, except where the burden or expense of doing so would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, where the rights of persons other than you would be violated or where doing so is otherwise consistent with applicable law.
Unless prohibited by applicable law, Parse.ly reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee to cover costs for providing copies of Personal Information that you request.
Please note that while any amendments, corrections, or deletions will be reflected in active user databases (as updated within a reasonable period of time), Parse.ly may retain all Personal Information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, and satisfaction of other legal obligations we reasonably believe applicable.
==========
If you are accessing the Services on behalf of a Customer, you may review and/or change certain of your Personal Information by logging into the Site and accessing the Customer's Account.
We may limit the Personal Information you can change on the Site.
==========
You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you have previously chosen to provide us as to which you have not instructed us to take such action.
Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.
==========
Upon your request, we will close your Account as soon as reasonably possible, in accordance with applicable law.
We may continue to use your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy even after we have closed your account, except that we will not display it on the Site or through the Services in a manner that personally identifies you.
In addition, we may retain your Personal Information to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
==========
HOW WE TRANSFER DATA WE COLLECT INTERNATIONALLY
Privacy Shield
Parse.ly does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of Personal Data.
Nonetheless, Parse.ly has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data and, for as long as Parse.ly is self-certified to the Privacy Shield, Parse.ly agrees to process EU Data in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
==========

Dispute Resolution
If you are an individual in the EU, the United Kingdom or Switzerland who believes that your personal data is included in the Parse.ly Services Personal Data, you may direct any concerns or complaints to us at privacy@parsely.com.
If we do not resolve your complaint, you may contact JAMS, our designated independent dispute resolution provider for Privacy Shield inquiries.
==========
You can contact JAMS, which is based in the United States, through its website at the following link: https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.
If neither Parse.ly nor JAMS resolves your complaint, you may, in certain circumstances, be able to seek binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.
You can read more about binding arbitration in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.
Standard Contractual Clauses
While the ECJ’s decision in Case C-311/18 has raised uncertainty (and possibly invalidated) the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, we rely on other data transfer mechanisms to ensure the privacy and protection of customer data, including the standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) and other mechanisms approved by the European Union and Switzerland, respectively, for transfers of Personal Information from the EEA (and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and Switzerland, which remain a valid means of transfer.
A copy of the relevant SCCs can be obtained by contacting us at support@parsely.com.
==========
Parse.ly encourages you to raise questions about our processing or disclosure of your Personal Information by contacting us, as set forth in the "Contact Us" section.
Parse.ly will undertake reasonable efforts to investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.
Any of our personnel that we determine are in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, where applicable.

Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights (CCPA)
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us at: +1-212-920-6846
Emailing us at: support@parsely.com
Contacting us via our web-based form: https://www.parse.ly/contact
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
==========
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format (CCPA)
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
==========
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
==========
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
==========
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
==========
Non-Discrimination (CCPA)
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
==========
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
