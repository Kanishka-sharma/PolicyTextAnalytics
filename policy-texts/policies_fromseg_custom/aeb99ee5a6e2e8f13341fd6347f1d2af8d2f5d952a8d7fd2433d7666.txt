Tell-A-Friend Tools
Squarespace provides a number of tools that will allow you to promote your website (or articles on your website) over email.
==========
Email addresses entered into these forms are not stored in our database, but may be stored in our system logs in text format to assist us in tracking down abusive users (users flooding the system), or using these tools for spamming.
We will never contact addresses logged in this manner.
The email sent through any of these mechanisms is a one time email only.
==========
Hosted websites
Users hosting websites with Squarespace are given tools that may ask you to optionally enter your email address when making comments on their website, or contacting them through their website.
Since users on Squarespace can manipulate the HTML code on their site directly, there are opportunities available for a malicious user to inject code that would log your information before it reaches our system.
In addition, once in our system, website owners will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their website.
Since we do not have full control over how members run their individual sites, this privacy policy does not apply to any hosted Squarespace website that you do not own.
You should check that you trust the owner of a particular website before submitting personally identifiable information on that site.
