Vine Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how and when Vine collects, uses, and shares your information when you use Vine, including
            our mobile applications and websites (the "Services").
Vine receives your information through our mobile applications,
            websites, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services.
When using any of our Services you consent
            to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described
            in this Privacy Policy.
Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to use your information in,
            and as a result to transfer it to and store it in, the United States and any other country where we operate.
Privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where you live.
==========
Information Collection and Use

Creating a Vine Account and Profile Information: When you create a Vine account, you must provide access
            credentials either in the form of an email address and password or by authentication using another service, such
            as Twitter.
You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio, location,
            and profile picture.
If you create your Vine account by connecting through another service, we may use public
            information from that connected account to help complete your Vine profile.
You may update or modify your profile
            information and contact information at any time.
Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such
            as on your profile page.
Contact Information: In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this
            information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the
            Services.
We may use the contact information (such as your phone number or email address) to help connect you
            with other Vine users, even if that information is not publicly displayed.
Some contact information may be required
            in order to use certain Services.
==========
For example, you must have a verified phone number attached to your account
            in order to send a Vine Message to someone who does not follow you.
Finding Friends and Connecting to Other Services: Our Services include several features to help connect
                    you to the accounts of people you already know.
For example, you may upload information from your address
                    book or connect your Vine account to your account on another service such as Twitter.
Vine will match
                    the information you provide with the contact information of other Vine users in order to provide and
                    improve the Services, for example by making recommendations and routing Vine messages.
You may remove
                    address book data from Vine at any time through the settings in your Vine app.
When you connect your
                    Vine account to other services, you are able to post your Content to those services as well.
You may
                    disconnect your Vine account from your account on the other services at any time.
==========
Disconnecting your
                    Vine account will immediately revoke our authorization to cross-post on your behalf or otherwise access
                    that account and we will delete information obtained from that connection (other than information that
                    was publicly posted on Vine, such as profile information), which may take some time.
Content, Following, and other Public Information: Vine is a video sharing platform, so most of the
                    information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public.
This includes not only the
                    Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts
                    you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services.
==========
Your
                    public information is broadly and instantly disseminated.
For instance, your profile information and
                    public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access Vine.
When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are
                    making public.
==========
Location Information: In addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact location
                    if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information.
We may use and
                    store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with
                    a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that has been tagged
                    near your location.
Links: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email
                    notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other
                    means.
==========
We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be
                    able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data
                    and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing
                    public videos.
A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk.
Vine may
                    use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services,
                    to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and
                    improve our Services.
==========
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.
If you do not want cookies
                    from Vine or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting
                    cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
However, some Services
                    may not function properly if you disable cookies.
==========
Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("
                    Log Data") created by your use of the Services.
Log Data may include information such as your
                    IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile
                    carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information.
We receive Log Data when you
                    interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,view videos
                    hosted by Vine, or interact with our email notifications.
Vine uses Log Data to provide our Services
                    and to measure, customize, and improve them.
If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data
                    or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after
                    18 months.
==========
Third-Party Services: Vine uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, including
                    to host our various blogs and wikis and to help us understand the use of our Services.
These third-party
                    service providers may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of our
                    Services and other websites and services, including your IP address, device ID, pages viewed, and links
                    clicked.
Our service providers include
                    Google Analytics and its demographics and interests reporting feature, which you can opt out of
                    here and
                    here.
Information Sharing and Disclosure

Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you choose
                    to publicly post a video or update your profile information.
Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in
                    the United States and abroad.
We may share your private personal information with such service providers
                    subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that
                    the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
==========
Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose
                    your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal
                    request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect
                    Vine’s rights or property.
However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses
                    or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to disclose your
                    information.
Business Transfers: In the event that Vine is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization
                    or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.
The promises
                    in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
==========
Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or
                    otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public posts, the people
                    you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only
                    one did).
Modifying Your Personal Information
If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or
                    modify the profile information you provided to us and associated with your account.
You can also permanently delete your Vine account by
                    contacting us.
Our Policy Towards Children
Our Services are not directed to persons under 13.
If you become aware that your child has provided us
                        with personal information without your consent, please
                        contact us.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
If we become
                        aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such
                        information and terminate the child's account.
==========
Changes to this Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.
The most current version of the policy will govern
                        our use of your information and will always be at
                        https://vine.co/privacy.
If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is
                        material, we will notify you via an email to the email address associated with your account or through
                        the Services.
By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you
                        agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
Effective: January 27, 2016.

Vine Archive - Privacy Policy

                        This Privacy Policy describes how and when Twitter, Inc. and Twitter International Company (collectively,
                        “Twitter”), collect, use, and share your information when you use the Vine Archive or otherwise
                        access videos, information, text, graphics, photos, and other materials that users previously posted
                        publicly on Vine (collectively referred to as
                        “Content”) on the Vine Archive.
When using the Vine Archive, you acknowledge the practices and
                        policies described in this Privacy Policy.
As of the effective date of this policy, you will only
                        be able to access archives of Content, in accordance with our
                        Terms of Service (
                        “Terms”), that users previously posted publicly on Vine.
All other features of The Vine Archive,
                        including the ability to create a Vine account, log into an account, and post new Content, are disabled
                        and we retain no non-public user information except for information necessary to display Content
                        and otherwise operate the Vine Archive.
Information Collection


Public Content: Vine was a video sharing platform through which users were able to share
                            videos and profile information, among other information, with a wide range of users and other
                            services that accessed Vine.
Certain public profile information, such as Vine handles and videos,
                            continues to be available publicly on the Vine Archive.
We do not update the Vine Archive and
                            you no longer have the ability to post new Content.
==========
Twitter will generally continue to host this
                            information until we receive a request to delete such data in accordance with the instructions
                            provided below or as required by law (see
                            “Deleting Your Personal Information” below).
Personal Information You Provide: You may provide personal information to us, for example
                            when you request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.
The types of information
                            we may collect include your name, email address, and any other information you choose to provide.
We use this information to respond to your questions or concerns.
==========
The Vine Archive does not allow
                            the submission of personal information.
Log Data: Our servers automatically record information (
                            "Log Data") created by your use of the Vine Archive, such as when you view Content hosted
                            by Twitter.
Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, or operating
                            system.
Twitter uses Log Data for troubleshooting and related activities necessary to maintain
                            the the Vine Archive.
Purposes and Legal Bases
We use information we receive from you for the purposes described below, except where restricted by law.
In doing so, Twitter relies on its legitimate interests to lawfully process such data:


Archiving Content in the Public Interest: Twitter hosts the Vine Archive, which contains
                            Content people chose to publicly share.
==========
We do this to preserve our users’ historic speech and
                            to preserve access to Content that was publicly posted on the internet.
This furthers our users’
                            right to free expression and the right of members of the public to access public speech.
We generally
                            remove Content where requested by the individual who posted it (see
                            “Deleting Your Personal Information/Your Rights” below).
==========
Operating Our Site: Twitter may also use your information as necessary to pursue our legitimate
                            interests of enforcing our Terms and preventing unlawful activities and misuse of the Vine Archive;
                            protecting the legal rights, property, safety, and security of Twitter and our users; and resolving
                            disputes involving you relating to the Vine Archive.
Twitter may also use your personal information
                            where reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or governmental
                            requests.
Information Sharing and Disclosure


User-Controlled Sharing: Content on the Vine Archive can be collected and used by others
                            and redistributed through the internet and other media channels.
Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide the Vine
                            Archive to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries.
We may share information with
                            such service providers on the condition that they use the data only on our behalf, pursuant to
                            our instructions, and subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or
                            disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law,
                            regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security
                            or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.
However, nothing in this Privacy Policy
                            is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including
                            a government's, request to disclose your information.
Change of Ownership and Affiliates: In the event Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger,
                            acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, information may be sold or transferred as part
                            of that transaction.
The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to information as transferred
                            to the new entity.
We may also disclose information to our corporate affiliates in order to help
                            operate our services and our affiliates’ services.
Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose aggregated or otherwise non-personal information.

When we transfer personal data outside of the European Union or EFTA States, we ensure an adequate level
                        of protection for the rights of data subjects based on the adequacy of the receiving country’s data
                        protection laws, contractual obligations placed on the recipient of the data (model clauses may be
                        requested by inquiry as described below), or EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles.
Twitter, Inc. complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles (the “Principles”) regarding

                        here.
Retention
Since the Vine Archive is an archive of public Content, we hope (but assume no obligation) to maintain
                        this Content indefinitely.
==========
If not already done earlier, we will delete Log Data after 30 days.
Deleting Your Personal Information / Your Rights

                        If you reside in certain territories, including the European Union or EFTA States, you benefit from a number of rights in
                        relation to your information.
While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only
                        in certain limited cases.
We describe these rights below:
                    


Access.
The Content we process in relation to the the Vine Archive is public, so it can be
                            freely accessed online.
==========
Change, Restrict, Delete.
You may also have rights to change, restrict our use of, or delete
                            your personal data.
As the data we hold is archived, we may be limited in our ability to change
                            or restrict the use of your data.
However, absent exceptional circumstances (like where we are
                            required to store data for legal reasons) we will generally delete your personal data upon request.
To request the deletion of your data please contact us at
                            vinehelp@twitter.com.
==========
Object.
As we process your information based on our legitimate interests, you can object
                            to this processing in certain circumstances.
In such cases, we will delete your personal data
                            unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for
                            legal reasons.
Complain.
If you reside in the European Union or EFTA States, should you wish to raise a
                            concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may
                            have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority, or with the Irish
                            Data Protection Commissioner whose contact details can be found
                            here.
==========
Our Policy Towards Children
The Vine Archive is not directed to persons under 16.
We do not knowingly collect personal information
                        from children under 16.
If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal data,
                        we will delete such information from our systems.
==========
Changes to this Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
