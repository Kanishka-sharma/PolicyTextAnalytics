The data we collect
Smart AdServer is a remote adserving system.

Sites and Advertisers are using the system to manage the delivery of their online advertising campaigns.
They can collect anonymous statistical data on their visitors to follow the delivery of their campaign and to increase their performance.

Some statistics may relate to the performance of the campaign (‘return of investment’).
