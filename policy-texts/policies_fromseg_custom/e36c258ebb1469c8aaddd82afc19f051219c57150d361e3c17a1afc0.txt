Blockthrough is a Header Bidding wrapper for the adblocked web.
What is the Adblocked Web: Settings within a web browser or, software available to download to a computer, can enable a consumer to block advertising being served to them as they surf the web.
This is called Ad Blocking.
If a consumer chooses to block general advertising in this way but consents to access a layer of filtered advertising which only serves campaigns and creative that adheres to the Acceptable Ads specification (www.acceptableads.com), it is possible that the advertising will have been enabled by Blockthrough.
Consumers consent to Acceptable Ads via their adblocker settings.
