WHAT ARE COOKIES AND SDKS?
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on Your computer or mobile device every time You visit a website.
It enables the website to remember Your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so You don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever You return to the website or browse from one page to another.
==========
SDK stands for “Software Development Kit”.
These are collections of software development tools that we use to provide products and services to the User.
Some SDKs are required for App software development.
For example, the iOS SDK is required for any iOS Application.
One SDK that our Android and iOS Applications both use is the Firebase Analytics SDK.
==========
This allows for Us to track App performance metrics and usage.
This data is anonymized and provides guidance on what to improve in future App Versions.
==========
Cookies and SDKs have different lifespans:
Persistent: these files remember certain information about Your preferences for viewing a website or mobile app, and allows the website or mobile app manager to recognise you each time you return.
These are stored on Your browser cache or mobile device until You choose to delete them.
==========
Session: these files are specific to a particular visit to a website or mobile app that carry information as You view different pages on a website or mobile app so You don’t have to re-enter information.
HOW WE USE COOKIES AND SDKS
Our Cookies and SDKs: We use Our domain specific persistent cookies and mobile app specific SDKs to uniquely identify You after You access Our Service.
==========
Upon successfully logging in, Our server will generate a unique and random token.
A copy of the token is saved on Our server, and a copy is sent to Your browser as a cookie or a copy is sent to Your mobile app as a login token.
Your browser or mobile device sends this token back to Our server each time it requests a resource from Our server, such as a new page to which You are navigating.
Our servers then look up Your secure profile using this token.

==========

Attribution tracking means identifying the advertising or marketing source a user followed to arrive at Our Service, or to determine what source should get credit for Service visits.
Remarketing means showing relevant ads to users based on users’ prior search history on Our Service.

==========
We do not allow third parties to access personally identifiable information from Us via cookies, SDKs, or tracking technology.

See Our Privacy Policy for more information about the types of information that We gather and how it is used.
==========
Like other websites, We use tracking technologies (collectively, "cookies").
Cookies enable Us to learn about what ads You see, what ads You click, and other actions You take on Our Service and other websites.
This allows Us to provide You with more useful and relevant ads and avoid showing You the same ads repeatedly.
==========
We do not associate Your interaction with unaffiliated sites with Your identity in providing You with interest-based ads.
We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third-party sites that display Our interest-based ads.
However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalised ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who bought or browsed for specific categories of goods).
==========
We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third-party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by Our Privacy Policy or this Policy.
