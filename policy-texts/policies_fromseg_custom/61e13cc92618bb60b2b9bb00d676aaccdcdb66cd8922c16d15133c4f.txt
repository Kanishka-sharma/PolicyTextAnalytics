This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by New IT Solutions, Ltd. (“4shared”, “we” or “us”) with respect to your access and use of 4shared's online file storage and sharing service (the “Service”) so you can make an informed decision about using the Service.
We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.
We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated.
==========
We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used.
What Is Personal Information?
As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual.
Personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed.
==========
This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
What Information Do We Collect?
Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service.
For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email); and (ii) to which you provide us access.
==========
Such information may include personal information, such as your name, email address, gender, date of birth, city of residence, social network data and performance related data.
Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.
Passive Collection: When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service.
We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of the Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session.
We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies."
Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website.
==========
We only use session cookies, i.e. the cookie files are kept only for the duration of each log-in session to allow you to operate without having to identify yourself at each action you take during that session.
Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience.
If we link cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information.

However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service.
