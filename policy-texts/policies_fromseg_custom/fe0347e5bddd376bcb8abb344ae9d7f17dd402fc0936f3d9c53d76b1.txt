Personal Information

            In order to provide quality communication, DigiCert collects information such as the name, organization, and email address of website visitors who voluntarily submit that information to download software or to submit sales or technical support questions.
We also collect information required to issue certificates (as specified in our Certification Practices Statement) when you buy certificates from our site.
This information is voluntarily submitted by the customer or is obtained from third-party databases during the validation process.
==========
Regardless of the source, DigiCert protects personal information as confidential information except where the information is embedded in an issued digital certificate.
This information is necessary for the digital certificate's operation and is considered public information.
DigiCert's certificate profiles, available through DigiCert's online repository at https://www.digicert.com/ssl-cps-repository.htm, list the information embedded in each certificate type.
When performing validation, DigiCert uses third party sources to confirm or supplement customer information.
We may receive information about you from other sources, including third parties from whom we have purchased access to certain data, and combine this data with information we already have about you.
We may confirm or supplement, for instance, address, email and company name for validation and verification purposes.
==========
Accessing and Updating Personal Information

            Generally, a customer can review, delete inaccuracies, and update personal information through its DigiCert account interface by clicking edit under the Account Profile tab.
Alternatively, upon request DigiCert will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.
You may also access, correct or request deletion of your personal information by sending an email to privacy@digicert.com or by mailing DigiCert at the address listed in this policy.
Emailed and mailed requests are subject to DigiCert's satisfaction about the authenticity of the request.
We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
==========
DigiCert retains information about customers while the customer’s account is active, while a certificate remains unexpired, and in accordance with industry standards.
A customer may request account cancellation or request that DigiCert no longer provide services by emailing privacy@digicert.com.
DigiCert may retain certain customer information after receiving a request to cancel services or disable an account, as necessary to comply with industry standards and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce customer agreements.
==========
Personal information embedded in a digital certificate cannot be directly edited.
Customers wishing to update personal information in a digital certificate must submit a change request through the customer account.
DigiCert may require that the updated information be verified for accuracy prior to accepting the change request.
In addition, even if information is updated in DigiCert's databases, the information will generally not be updated in the issued digital certificate.
If information embedded in a digital certificate needs updating, DigiCert may require revocation of the digital certificate.
==========
