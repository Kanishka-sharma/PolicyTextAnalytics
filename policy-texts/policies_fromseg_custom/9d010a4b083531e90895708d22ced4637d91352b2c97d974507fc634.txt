Privacy Tips, Tools and Resources
Managing your privacy in today’s fast-paced world can be a daunting task.
Fortunately, you can take steps to control how and where your listing information appears.
==========
We offer the following suggestions to help you.
Understand the fine print on “free” offers
When something is advertised as “free” it often means that – in return for a free service or chance to win a prize – you must provide information about yourself.
Whenever you provide personal contact information, read the fine print to learn how the information will be used and whether it will be shared with third parties.
Read Web sites’ privacy policies (and other fine print)
A company’s Privacy Policy informs users how information is collected, used and shared.
Be sure to read a company’s Privacy Policy before providing any personally identifiable information.
A company’s Terms of Use/Service is also a good source of information to better understand the company’s principles regarding your use of their products and services.
==========
Get a P.O. Box
One of the most effective and inexpensive things you can do to keep your home address private is to get a Post Office Box, submit a permanent change of address to that P.O. Box and use that address when filling out forms and applications.
Taking these steps helps reduce the circulation of your home address, both online and offline.
Use available technology
Block “Caller ID” on your phone
Use spam-blocker, anti-virus and anti-spyware software
Obtain your annual free credit report online
Set your Web browser’s privacy settings to your preference
Be thorough and vigilant
WhitePages offers a fast, easy and free method for you to remove information from our Web sites.
Unfortunately, not every company that publishes listing information offers the same level of service.
==========
Your ability to control personal information held by offline companies is even less accessible.
If there is not a clear path to remove your information from a company’s Web site or records, we recommend that you contact the company directly to request the removal of your information.
Persistence is often the key to success.
==========
Develop a personal privacy routine
Create a privacy schedule and set reminders for yourself.
Spend time searching for and removing information that you wish to keep private.
By establishing a sensible, recurring, privacy-centric routine, you will be better able to control and maintain your privacy preferences.
