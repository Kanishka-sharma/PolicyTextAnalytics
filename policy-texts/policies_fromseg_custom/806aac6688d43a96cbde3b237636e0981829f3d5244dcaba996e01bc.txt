About Lotame’s Products and Services
Lotame does not provide products or services directly to consumers.
Instead, Lotame has products and services that help businesses – marketers, advertising agencies and publishers – engage in interest-based advertising.
Interest based advertising is the practice of delivering relevant content and advertising to people based on their interests, activities, and behaviors.
==========
Note that when providing interest-based advertising services to its clients, Lotame does not use information that we deem to be personal information, which is information that identifies you as a specific person (such as your name, address, email address, or phone number), but we may use de-identified personal information as further described below.
Lotame has the following products and services, which are collectively our “Services”:
Online Advertising Products and Services.
Some of Lotame’s services, including the Lotame Data Exchange (“LDX”), allow Lotame clients to reach the right online audiences for their products and services.
To provide these services, Lotame licenses online data from third party data providers (including website owners, app owners, data aggregators, and SmartTV manufacturers) and makes this data available to its clients.
This data is called “Third Party Data”.
Lotame’s clients use this Third Party Data to create data segments associated with certain interests, behaviors, and attributes (for example, an interest in travel or an interest in sports).
These data segments are associated with cookies and advertising identifiers, so that clients can send relevant advertisements to consumers on their computers, phones, and other mobile devices.
SaaS Products and Services.
==========
Lotame has software as a service products, including the Lotame Data Management Platform (“DMP”), that Lotame licenses to clients.
These products assist those clients in collecting and organizing information about their customers from their own sources – including client websites, mobile applications, advertising campaigns, CRM systems, and data partners – and then using this information for digital advertising purposes.
Lotame provides the tools that facilitate our clients’ collection and export of this data (called, “First Party Data”) and Lotame acts as a service provider in processing this data at the direction of those clients.
==========
Marketing Technology Services.
Lotame has additional products and services that help clients use data to deliver personalized content and advertising to users both online, via computers, phones, and other mobile devices, and offline, via more traditional marketing methods.
For example, Lotame helps clients to bring data that was collected offline into the online space, where it can be used for digital advertising purposes; and Lotame helps clients to identify relationships across computers, phones and other mobile devices, so that a user can benefit from targeted advertising across multiple devices.
==========
Data Collection and Use
Lotame collects information directly.
Lotame also collects and receives information on behalf of its clients and receives information from third parties for use in its Services.
Lotame collects information via many methods, including cookies, pixel tags, SDKs (software development kits), secure file transfers, and server to server connections.
Information Collected by Lotame
The following information is collected and used by Lotame to provide its Services:
Demographic Information, such as:
Age
Gender
Income Range
Online Behavioral Information
Lotame collects information on your online browsing activity to determine what types of activities and products you may be interested in and how you interact with certain content and advertisements.
==========
This information includes:
Inferred behavioral data
Websites and content viewed
Mobile applications used
Date and time of visits to a website
Search terms used on a website
Frequency of visits to a website
Engagement with an advertisement
Technical Identifiers
These can be used to identify your device and typically include:
Cookies
Mobile advertising identifiers (Apple IDFA and Google AAID)
IP address
Non-personal data inferred from an IP address, such as non-precise geo-location data
Client and Partner IDs
Clients and partners may provide Lotame with proprietary IDs, which are IDs that identify a customer or consumer to the client or partner.
These client and partner IDs may correspond to personal information of the client or partner but Lotame does not see the personal information connected with these IDs.
Personally Identifiable Information That Has Been De-Identified
Lotame may use personal information that has been de-identified, typically by using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code.
==========
We use that de-identified data to provide our services (including to connect your activity and interests).
We may provide the hashing service to our clients.
In such instances, we will delete or destroy the original, personal information after the hashing process has been completed, retaining only the de-identified data.
We do not use the non-hashed personal information for any purpose other than to create the hashed version of the data on behalf of our client.
==========
Use of Information Collected by Lotame
Lotame analyzes the information it collects and receives, and organizes it into user groups and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions.
Our clients and partners then use the Lotame-created user groups and audiences, along with information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content to users on their computers, phones, and other mobile devices.
Clients have the ability to combine this Third Party Data with their own First Party Data when using Lotame’s SaaS and Marketing Technology Services.
Our clients and partners may also analyze and organize the underlying data to create custom user groups and audiences.
==========
Lotame uses the information it collects and receives to:
Identify relationships between different browsers and devices
Analyze the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns
Provide aggregated information about user interests
Attribute user interests to browsers and devices
Test the accuracy of certain products, including cross-device matching
Determine the overlap in First Party and Third Party data sets
Create pre-packaged audience segments
Lotame clients generally use First Party Data, along with Third Party Data provided by Lotame, to:
Deliver targeted advertising campaigns to users across devices
Serve targeted content to users across devices
Improve the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns
Create data-driven marketing products, including models
At the request of clients, Lotame also shares First and Third Party Data with other companies that are responsible for the actual display and targeting of online advertising – including demand side platforms, advertising networks, advertising exchanges, and social media networks.
Lotame does not create or share audience segments through its Online Advertising Products and Services that are classified by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) as Sensitive Information (as defined in the NAI Code of Conduct).

==========
Children
Lotame does not generate audience segments that are targeted to children younger than the age of 13.
Consumer Choice and the Ability to Opt-Out
Lotame collects First and Third Party Data online via the use of Lotame pixel tags, cookies and other technologies.
These allow Lotame to collect information from websites that Lotame does not own or operate.
Lotame provides you with the ability to opt-out of the collection and use of your information for interest-based advertising via all of Lotame’s Services.
==========
This means that Lotame, and any clients that utilize data collected by Lotame using a Lotame pixel tag or similar technologies, will not have the right to use your data for online interest-based advertising purposes.
Lotame and its clients may still collect and use data for other purposes, including analytics and research.
Additionally, you will still receive online advertisements, but these advertisements may be less relevant to your interests.
==========

Data Sharing
In addition to sharing certain data as directed by clients, we may share information that is non-personal or de-identified with other clients and third party companies such as advertisers, agencies, ad networks or exchanges, to provide services to our clients and to enable our clients and those third parties to analyze user behaviors or to customize the ads that you see online.
