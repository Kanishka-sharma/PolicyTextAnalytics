Beeswax runs a technology buying platform for digital media.
The Beeswax technology allows our customers to buy ad space on websites, mobile apps, video players, and other devices.
When ad space is bought or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet users who visit that site, apps, or device.
Generally, an Internet user's computer or mobile device comes into contact with Beeswax technology when a user views an ad delivered by our technology or clicks or taps on the ad to visit the advertiser's website or app.
PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY
Advertising supports free content and digital user experiences that we all love.
==========
Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to display ads that may be of interest to you.
We believe that relevant ads are more valuable to users than less relevant ads.
More relevancy also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads which in turn leads to higher quality and richer consumer experiences.
