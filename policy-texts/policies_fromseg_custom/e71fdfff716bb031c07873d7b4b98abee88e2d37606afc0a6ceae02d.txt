We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or 
            exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
            prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, 
            situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, 
            violations of Jeeran.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Jeeran.com is acquired by or merged with 
            another company.
In this event, Jeeran.com will notify you before information 
            about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Jeeran.com displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.
==========
Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who 
        interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for 
        example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
Jeeran.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you 
            interact with or view a targeted ad.
However, by interacting with or viewing an 
            ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the 
            assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

            insurance agents, stock brokers, and mortgage lenders) and non-financial 
            companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

        providers in different industries and categories of business.
