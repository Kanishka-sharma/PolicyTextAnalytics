==========
PHI is information about you that we obtain to provide our services to you and that can be used to identify you.
It includes your name and contact information, as well as information about your health, medical conditions and prescriptions.
It may relate to your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision or health care products and services to you or payment for such products or services.
==========
We are required by law to protect the privacy of your PHI and to provide you with this Notice explaining our legal duties and privacy practices regarding your PHI.

If you would like additional information about state law protections in your state, or additional use or disclosure restrictions that may apply to sensitive PHI, please contact the CVS Health Privacy Office.
