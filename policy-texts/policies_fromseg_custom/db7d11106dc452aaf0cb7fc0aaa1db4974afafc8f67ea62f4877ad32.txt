What is a Whois privacy service and why do I need it?
When you register a domain, ICANN requires the registrar to forward the contact information you provide them with, for inclusion in the Internet's Whois Database.
The free Whois privacy service replaces this personal information with anonymized contact information.
==========
This protects your private information from being mined and used for other purposes, such as identity theft or unsolicited marketing.
In addition, our partner Withheld for Privacy, doesn’t require your information as a condition of using their privacy services.
Withheld for Privacy is based in Iceland, a country known for its privacy standards.
