Arbitration and Governing Law
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.
ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT; THE RULES, INCLUDING DISCOVERY ARE DIFFERENT AND NO JUDGE OR JURY IS PRESENT AT AN ARBITRATION.
THE AWARD IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
==========
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Ask Apps Products, or the websites and features available therefrom, shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association.
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against Ask Apps in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against Ask Apps any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
By using the Ask Apps Products in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.
In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Ask Apps (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court).
AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 20, YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.
==========
Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
==========
Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York.
You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in New York County, New York.
This Class Action Waiver section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Ask Apps, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to this EULA (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability) or the Ask Apps Products (for example, relating to any person's access to or use of the Ask Apps Products, or the provision of content, products, services, or technology on or through the Ask Apps Products, or the handling of information collected on the Ask Apps Products).
If any provision of this EULA is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, you agree that every attempt shall be made to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in that provision, and the remaining provisions contained in this EULA shall continue in full force and effect.
