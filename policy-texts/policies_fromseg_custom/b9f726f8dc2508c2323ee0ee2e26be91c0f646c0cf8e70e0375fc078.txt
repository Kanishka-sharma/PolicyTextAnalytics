Alexa is committed to ensuring 
        the privacy of our users.
This policy describes what user information 
        we collect and how we use it.
To improve our Web site, we 
          use our Web usage logs and cookie data with standard tools to understand 
          how people, in aggregate, are using the site.
We request email and demographic 
          information as part of the user registration process for the Alexa service.
We use this information to contact our users with information related 
          to the services, to personalize the service, to understand the use of 
          the service, and to describe the Alexa user base in general terms to 
          potential users and the press.
A user can choose to remove an email 
          address from our mailing list by sending email to support@alexa.com.

We report Web site owner contact 
          information gathered from multiple sources.
This information can be 
          edited or removed by the site owner by using the Alexa 
          Site Information Editor.
When using the service, we collect 
          information on Web usage which remains anonymous.
This information is 
          used in the aggregate to cluster related Web sites together.
Further, 
          we use this information to determine popular pages and sites by measuring 
          clicks within a site and the length of time a user spends on a page.
This information is used to create the Related Links feature of the 
          service.
The Alexa service uses cookies 
          to remember the toolbar settings between sessions.
We also use our data, in aggregate, 
          to create reports and summaries for internal use and external sale.
We do not include our users' email addresses in these reports.
