Personal data protection
The European Union is committed to user privacy.
The policy on protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions is based on Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC.
This general policy covers the European Union's family of institutional websites, within the eu domain.
==========
Although you can browse through most of these websites without giving any information about yourself, in some cases, personal information is required in order to provide the e-services you request.
Websites that require such information treat it according to the policy described in the Regulation mentioned above and provide information about the use of your data in their specific privacy policy statements.
In this respect:
for each e-service, a controller determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data and ensures conformity with the privacy policy
within each institution, a Data Protection Officer ensures that the provisions of the regulation are applied and advises controllers on fulfilling their obligations
for all the institutions, the European Data Protection Supervisor will act as an independent supervisory authority
The European Union's family of institutional websites, within the europa.eu domain, provides links to third party sites.
Since we do not control them, we encourage you to review their privacy policies.
