Cookies: Our websites employ cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on Boston.com and Boston Globe Services, as well as to track site usage.

In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our websites.
In the course of serving these advertisements, the third party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain.
We also reserve the right to place a New York Times Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs): Third party advertisers may also use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our site.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users.
For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service.
The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Please keep in mind that we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs.
For a list of these commercial and advertising agencies and their privacy policies, as well as more information about your option not to accept cookies or clear gifs placed by these companies, please click here.
