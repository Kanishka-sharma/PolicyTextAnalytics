Arbitration Provision.
==========
THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE BY USING THE AFFIRM SERVICE OR THE WEBSITE.
Except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to the Website, your use of the Affirm Service, a product offered or provided by or through the Website or Service, or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement that cannot be resolved directly between you and Affirm shall be resolved by non-appearance based binding arbitration, rather than in court.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this includes any claims based in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
==========
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award an individual the same damages and relief as a court and must apply and follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.
Either you or we can initiate arbitration through the alternative dispute resolution provider the American Arbitration Association pursuant to the then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary based on the request of one of the parties and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
You and Affirm each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree to proceed only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
The parties hereby appoint the arbitrator the exclusive power to rule on any challenges to the requirement for the use of alternative dispute resolution process in these terms.
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to obtain interim or preliminary injunctive relief necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Affirm or our Affiliated Parties pending the completion of the arbitration.
==========
Except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, all claims you bring against Affirm must be resolved in accordance with this “Disputes with Affirm” Section.
Any claim filed or brought contrary to this Disputes Section shall be considered improperly filed.
Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, Affirm may recover from you attorneys' fees and costs up to $1500 per claim, provided that Affirm first has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
