Strictly necessary cookies and tags are used by Visa to support the basic operations of our websites and apps.
They enable core website functions, such as authentication, security, network management and accessibility.
You may be able to disable these by changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the website functions.
==========
Performance and operation cookies and tags are used by us and our service providers to manage our websites.
These activities may include collecting analytics about visitors to our website and collecting information about website usage.
We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve the website.
These cookies help us gather data to optimize our website’s performance.

==========
Marketing and personalization cookies are used to enable social sharing and to deliver interest-based ads to you online.
Social media cookies and tags used by us and social media platforms to enable users of the platforms to share content across our sites.
We also work with social media platforms to deliver ads to you when you use these platforms.
This targeting is done by the platform under its own terms of use.
==========
Advertising cookies and tags used by us, our service providers and third parties to personalize the ads delivered to you on our site and on other sites.
These cookies collect data about your online activity and allow ads to be displayed that may be of relevant interest to you.
These cookies also record which ads you have seen and whether you engaged with the ad.
These cookies help make sure that the ads you see are valuable to you and not repetitive.
==========
While we do not give any personally identifiable information to the third-party advertising companies, we may place third-parties’ cookies and tags when you visit a Visa website.
This practice allows these third parties to collect information from you using these technologies on our websites.
The information they collect is subject to their own privacy policies.
Uses of cookies can vary by country or state.
More information is provided in the supplemental privacy notices posted in the Privacy Center or in the relevant website or app.

You can also take advantage of industry-sponsored programs that allow you to control the way companies advertise to you.

Social Media and other Platforms
Our websites may enable you to interact with us and others via social media platforms.
This functionality is enabled using social media cookies and tags.
For example, some Visa websites allow you to sign in using social media platform credentials.
Please read the privacy statements provided by your social media platforms to understand how they use your information and to manage your choices.
We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using social media platforms.
These platforms allow us to personalize the ads that we display to you.
==========
To enable delivery of these ads, we convert your email address into a unique number.
The platforms also convert their user emails into unique numbers using the same process.
This allows the records to be matched without any exchange of data elements that can identify you on their own.
==========
The platforms perform the matching as a service provider to Visa, and they do not retain or use the file that we send them for their own purposes.
This process allows the platform to deliver our ads to our customers on the platform.
The platforms may gain insights about individuals who respond to the ads we serve.

This information is used to identify the device and authenticate you.
We may also use device-related information to associate you with different devices that you may use, including for fraud-protection purposes and to better target advertising.
In many cases, you can reset your device’s advertising ID.

A Guide to Cookies and Other Technologies
Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser.
Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return.
They also help us provide a customized experience and can enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud.

First-party cookies are those cookies that are placed by Visa.
These cookies are used by Visa and include all the essential cookies.
Third-party cookies are placed by another company, including service providers, social media cookies and third-party advertising companies.
==========
Cookies placed by third parties can be read by these third parties when you visit other sites in the advertising network, allowing a profile of your online behavior to be created so that the third party can deliver targeted ads from all its customers.
Flash Cookies and Silverlight Cookies
A Flash Cookie (also known as a Local Stored Object) is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology.
A Silverlight Cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology.
Flash and Silverlight are applications that allow delivery of dynamic content, such as video clips and animation.
These cookies are used to personalize and enhance your online experience, deliver dynamic content, and for security purposes.
They differ from “regular cookies” in that they are not managed using your browser settings.
See Your Choices above for how to manage these types of cookies.

Pixel Tags and Web Beacons
Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are tiny graphic images and small blocks of code placed on website pages, ads, or in emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action.
When you access the pages or you open an email, the tag lets us know you have accessed the web page or opened the email.
These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
==========
Server logs record activities on our websites.
Other types of logs collect similar information from our apps.
These logs record information about the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.
Our logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.
An IP address is a unique identifier that devices require to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet.
We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to Visa and the website you visit after you leave our site.
