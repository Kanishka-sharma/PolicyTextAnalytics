This Privacy Policy is designed to provide you with information on how we approach your privacy as an Internet user interacting with websites that have implemented our retargeting technology.
Please note that this Policy does not pertain to processing of data we collect through the www.rtbhouse.com website.
This issue is comprehensively addressed in RTB House RTB House Website Privacy Policy.

GENERAL INFORMATION
We provide online advertisement services to our clients, acting as a Demand Side Platform (DSP) in the programmatic advertising environment.
Our role is to give advertisers an effective tool to display their ads to you on websites and mobile applications you visit.
The ads displayed to you are meant to be highly personalized, i.e. tailored to your interests and thus most relevant to you.
To serve you personalized ads we collect and process certain information related to your online activity on the websites of our clients.
We achieve this by using “cookies” set on your browser while you visit our clients’ websites or other tracking technologies available on your device such as mobile advertising IDs.
Based on your browsing patterns we can understand what sort of products and services you are interested in and display advertisements compatible with these interests.
==========
While processing any information related to internet users we aim at ensuring highest level of privacy protection and transparency.
For this purpose we strictly comply with all applicable laws, in particular EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), e-Privacy Directive as well as established best practices in the digital advertising market.

HOW DO WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR DATA
In order to collect your data we use cookies and other tracking technologies.
Cookies are text files inserted in your web browser when you visit our client’s (advertiser’s) websites.
They allow to register certain activities you perform there (e.g. the products you browse, add to the shopping cart and purchase) and consequently to determine which ads should be displayed to you to match your current interests.
While providing our services we operate under creativecdn.com domain.
We store two cookies under this domain: (a) “u” which contains unique ID established for a specific user, (b) “ts”, which stores timestamp needed to establish cookie lifetime.
==========
Data collected with our cookies on the client’s website allow us to “retarget” visitors of such website with personalized ads displayed on other websites through the use of programmatic instantaneous auction system known as real-time bidding (RTB).
Real-time bidding procedure begins when you enter a certain website where our clients’ ads may be displayed to you – this triggers a ‘bid request’ being sent to us by our business partners.
It is after receiving such bid request that our technology uses data about your browsing activity on our client’s website to decide whether to respond it and if so – which ad to display to you.
Our platform is integrated with the RTB environment through cookie matching of technical identifiers (e.g. cookie IDs) used by our business partners (such as Supply-Side Platforms).
Cookie matching involves linking our partners’ user IDs which enables us to: (a) serve our clients’ advertisements on websites which use our business partners’ digital advertising technology, and (b) collect information related to our ad serving activity.
We also use the collected data to detect frauds and other potential dangers to privacy security as well as for calculating the usage levels of our technology, diagnose problems etc.
==========
We do not purchase any third-party data from data providers in order to optimize our services.
Please note that we process the data only for the above-mentioned purposes.
Our clients as well as publishers whose websites or mobile application you visit may independently collect and use the data related to you for different purposes.
3.
WHAT CATEGORIES OF DATA WE PROCESS
In connection with providing our services we collect the following information you:
unique online identifiers, including cookie IDs and mobile advertising IDs;
data related to your activity on the digital properties controlled by a client (e.g. IDs of products or product categories you viewed);
technical browser and device information (“user agent”);
timestamps;
IP addresses (collected only for fraud detection / non-specific geolocation purposes).

PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING (GDPR)
While providing retargeting services we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses or telephone numbers nor receive any additional data from our clients, which, along with data collected by our technology, would enable us to directly identify you.
By using our technology we can only recognize a user who has already visited one of our clients’ websites.
However, the data we collect is tied to unique online identification numbers which under GDPR are considered ‘online identifiers’ that allow us to ‘single out’ a specific user from other users.
According to the GDPR, information collected with the use of such tracking technologies may be considered personal data (this type of non-personally identifiable data is referred to as ‘pseudonymous data’).
Consequently, in cases where GDPR applies to our services we assure to comply with all requirements established by this legislation.
==========
We have also appointed Data Protection Officer, whom you may contact if you have further questions.
Please see the last chapter of this Privacy Policy for the Data Protection Officer contact details.
As a part of GDPR compliance programme we have joined the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) as a registered vendor and comply with the TCF policies.
