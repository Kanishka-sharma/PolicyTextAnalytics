Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information

                In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold your Personal Information.
In the event that we sell your Personal Information, you have the right to submit a request to opt-out
                of the sale of your Personal Information.
You may change your decision at any time and permit us to sell
                your Personal Information.
==========
After you opt-out, we may continue to share some Personal Information with our partners (who will
                function as our service providers in such instance) to help us perform business-related functions such
                as, but not limited to, providing the Service, ensuring that the Service is working correctly and
                securely, providing aggregate statistics and analytics and/or preventing fraud.
If you access our
                Websites from other devices or browsers, visit the links below from those devices or browsers to ensure
                your choice applies to the Personal Information collected when you use those devices or browsers.
Additionally, although clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link will opt
                you out of the sale of your Personal Information for advertising purposes, it will not opt you out of
                the use of previously collected and sold Personal Information (except for Personal Information sold
                within 90 days prior to your exercising your right to opt-out) or all interest-based advertising.
If you
                would like more information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising in desktop and mobile
                browsers on a particular device, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ and http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#.
You may also download the AppChoices app
                at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
                to opt-out in connection with mobile apps, or use the platform controls on your mobile device to
                opt-out.

Exercising Your Rights

                In addition, to request access to your Personal Information or request deletion of your Personal
                Information, you can also submit a verifiable consumer request to our email address: ccpa@playbuzz.com


                Only you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a consumer request related to your
                Personal Information.
The request must:
            



                        Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                        collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient details to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and
                        respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify
                        your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to
                        you.
==========
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We
                        will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
                        requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
We will only use Personal Information
                        provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to
                        make the request.
You may only request a copy of your data twice within a 12-month period.
If you have any general questions about the Personal Information that we collect about you how we use
                it, please contact us at ccpa@playbuzz.com.
Response Timing and Format

                Our goal is to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.
If we require
                more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing within the first 45 days
                period.
We will deliver our written response, by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures
                we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the request.
==========
If reasonably possible, we will
                provide your personal information in a format that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit
                the information without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
                repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you
                why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
In case of rejection, the response we provide will explain the reasons for which we cannot comply with
                your request.
==========
Please note that these CCPA rights are not absolute and requests are subject to any applicable legal
                requirements, including legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations.
Designating Agents

                You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf if:
            



                        The authorized agent is a natural person or a business entity registered with the Secretary of
                        State of California; and
                    



                        You sign a written declaration that you authorize the authorized agent to act on your behalf.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to exercise your right to know or your right to
                request deletion, please mail a certified copy of your written declaration authorizing the authorized
                agent to act on your behalf using the contact information below.
If you provide an authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code §§ 4000–4465, it may
                not be necessary to perform these steps and we will respond to any request from such authorized agent in
                accordance with the CCPA.

DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS

                Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other "Do
                Not Track" ("DNT") mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals
                that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and
                across third-party websites or online services.
We may revisit our policy on responding to these
                signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site.

RETENTION

                We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to operate our Websites or provide our
                services.
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
                resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.
Retention periods shall be determined taking into account
                the type of information that is collected and the purpose for which it is collected for, bearing in mind
                the requirements applicable to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused information at the
                earliest reasonable time.

==========
DATA SECURITY

                We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help prevent unauthorized
                access, use, or disclosure of your personal information.
While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept confidential, we cannot guarantee
                the security of any information.
You should be aware that there is always some risk involved in
                transmitting information over the internet and that there is also some risk that others could find a way
                to thwart our security systems.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we
                cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your personal information or other content you
                transmit using the Services or Websites, and you do so at your own risk.
Thus, we encourage you to
                exercise discretion regarding the personal information you choose to disclose.

Such substantial changes will take effect seven (7) days after such notice was provided on any of the
