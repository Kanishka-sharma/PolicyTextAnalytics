Livecareer understands how important your information is to you.
Therefore, Livecareer does not share any information with third parties that can be tied to you without your permission and allows you the option to opt-out of having your information shared with third parties.
If you do not exercise this opt-out option, personal information about you (such as your contact information 
    and other information collected during your visit to Livecareer) may be shared with colleges, universities,
     potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, 
     marketers (possibly in the form of list rental or license) and other organizations.

This aggregate information does not contain personal information which can identify any individual user.
==========
Third Party Service Providers--From time to time, Livecareer may decide that it is more efficient to use 
    third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to Livecareer's 
    users or career management services or job search services.
If we use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services.
These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by you or Livecareer.
The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our Site, which are governed by a more specific provision  (Links to Other Sites) below.

	  for example, by creating an electronic profile, creating your own web page and posting 
	  certain information, including via email.

	  results or reports visible to others, including through blogs, forums, message boards, etc.
