Privacy Policies for the Site
Personally Identifiable Information
We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) from the EyeView Website, www.wywviewdoigital.com.com, when you choose to provide it to us.
PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity.

This includes, but is not limited to: name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or email address.
For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on this Website.
We use this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry.
Once collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes.
The information that we store is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.

We may automatically collect certain information when you use the Site, such as your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to the Site, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system (“NonPII“).
We treat NonPII as PII if we combine it with or link it to any of the PII mentioned above.
Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.
==========
We use this information to understand our Site traffic and for maintenance of the Site.
Aggregate information (e.g., data we collect about use of the Site, or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities have been removed) helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Site.
This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters and are stored on a user’s hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history.
If we link cookies to any PII, we will treat this information as PII.
==========
Web beacons (also known as “1X1 pixels” or “clear GIFs”) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.

These third parties may place cookies, web beacons or other devices on your computer to collect NonPII, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties.
This Policy does not apply to the use of third party cookies or web beacons.
