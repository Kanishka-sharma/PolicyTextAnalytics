Privacy Information for 
			        
			               Ancestry.com
			        
					
						MyFamily.com, Inc., operator of this site, recognizes the confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members in registering or making purchases from our Website and we are committed to protecting your privacy.
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site.
Overview
						The personal, private information that is provided to us by individual members is not provided to unrelated third parties except in rare cases set forth below or involving possible violations of our Terms and Conditions or as may be required by law.
==========
We do collect some data, always with your knowledge, that is used to fulfill orders and otherwise enhance content to better meet the needs of our users.
The specifics of our use of personal information are best described in the answers to the following Frequently Asked Questions:
					
Do you ask for personal information from your members?
Yes.
==========
We ask for your name, e-mail address, and other limited personal information when you sign up as a member, when you use features such as e-mail, and when you make purchases from us.
Much of this information may be entered at your discretion.
We may ask for similar information at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by us and/or one of our partners.
==========
To facilitate payment and fulfillment in connection with membership and other purchases from us, we will request personal credit card, debit card or other payment information.
How do you use my personal information?
The primary use of your personal information, other than directly in connection with a purchase, is to efficiently provide you with personalized, relevant information.
We will also use registration information to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from us and to address customer service needs and requests.
==========
In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, the advertiser is not given access to individual account information.
We do not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these advertisers.
Advertisers simply provide the advertising message and we then display the ad to appropriate users.
==========
Will you disclose any of my personal information to third parties?
Ancestry will not disclose your personal information provided in connection with membership registration or purchases, except with your knowledge and consent as described in this Privacy Statement or as may be required by law, or to protect the rights or property of Ancestry.
Information submitted by you online (such as information about products you purchase from us, your name, address, e-mail address) may be shared with companies with which we have a commercial relationship and through which you reached Ancestry.com, for marketing purposes.
For example, if you make a purchase with us because of a special offer made through another site acting as a distributor of our products, in that circumstance you will be considered their customer as well.
If you object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request.
==========
We will not, except as may be required by law, share with any other party your password or payment information.
Other circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are specifically described when the data is collected, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.
We reserve the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45% of our users are female" or "47% of our users have attended college" in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties.
Under protection of confidentiality agreements, Ancestry may match common user information, such as name, address and phone number with third party data to avoid duplication and prevent errors.
What about purchases from advertisers or other linked sites?
If you click away from Ancestry.com to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered.
==========
These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices.
We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies.
You should therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used.
Will Ancestry use my information for direct mailings?
==========
We will send electronic mail or other mail to you, for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to Ancestry.com, or of any Ancestry.com or MyFamily.com, Inc. related products and services.
If you do not want to receive such mailings, you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail or at your preferences page.
May I refuse to provide personal information to you or to accept advertising?
Visitors may access Ancestry.com free services by providing a first name, last name, and e-mail address or other information that we may deem appropriate to that purpose.
To gain full access to the members-only areas, a username, e-mail address and appropriate billing information are required.
Because the Ancestry.com site is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising that appears on Ancestry.com pages, but you may opt to be excluded from any e-mail advertising.
==========
Do you use "IP Addresses" and cookies?IP Addresses:
						We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.
Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members and may be used to “geolocate” our members to allow us to provide services appropriate to your place of residence.
Cookies:
						Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site.
Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each time you return.
We may make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.
For instance, we may use cookies to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.
==========
Advertiser Cookies:
						We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.
These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.
Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.

When do you distribute or publish information on the living on your Sites?
Posts contributed by our members to message boards and other community areas may include information on the living.
While we advise our members to be sensitive to privacy issues, we have no control over the content of these posts.
If such a post violates our Terms and Conditions, you may notify us at “report abuse” and we will help work toward resolving the issue.
==========
We do republish databases that contain published information on the living, such as white pages, people finder directories and some birth, death and marriage records.
The information in these databases has been gathered from public records released by governmental and other agencies, and is available elsewhere, often on the Internet.
What else should I know about privacy?
==========
The following details a few key issues mentioned in context above:
					
Member Profiles
						You may provide information about yourself to the community and other areas of our sites, but only at your option.
If provided in a public community area, the data is, of course, public.
Participation in public areas and community services is at your discretion.
==========
Contests & Promotions
						We may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level).
We use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our partners.
The participant’s contact information is also used to contact him or her when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion.
At any time, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.
