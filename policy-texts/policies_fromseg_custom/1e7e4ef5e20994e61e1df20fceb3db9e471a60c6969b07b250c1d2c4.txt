Log Files

          As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store
          it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
          type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
          stamp, and clickstream data.

          demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
==========
Cookies

          "Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users.
SurveyMonkey.com
          uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content
          or grant you unimpeded access to the website.
With cookies enabled, you will not
          need to fill in password or contact information.
Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our website.
Cookie
          data allow us to track usage behavior and compile data that we can use to improve
          the site.
This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked.
Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning
          outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting.
==========
You can easily turn off cookies.
Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a
          warning when cookies are being sent.
However, our site will not function properly
          without cookies.
Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our website.
We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable 
          information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics 
          to help us improve our site.

We have no access or control over these cookies.

Information Use

          SurveyMonkey.com reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior
          and characteristics.
We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various
          areas of the website.
SurveyMonkey.com collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping.
Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World
          Wide Web.
==========
Our servers record incoming IP addresses.
The IP addresses are analyzed
          only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer's IP address.
By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to
          SurveyMonkey.com.
(Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general
          terms where you're from.)
