Within the captcha function, you may be asked to solve tasks or click on checkboxes.
The user input in this context and, if necessary, the mouse movements are used to estimate whether the input comes from a human being or an automated program.
The Captcha embedding is based on Art. 6 para.

Internet or other electronic network activity information
Geolocation Data
Inferences
It must be highlighted that 1plusX uses industry-standard encryption and security measures designed to protect any personal data from re-identification.
The sources of the collected data may be the following:
Customer’s web/mobile properties where the user’s activities are observed and recorded either via cookie, an SDK or a Data Layer
Online/ Offline Databases or Data Marketplaces
Ad Networks (including SSPs, DSPs, Ad Servers)
1plusX shares only anonymized information with Service Providers and Third Parties only to the extent that is required to fulfill the service.
1plusX does not share any information among customers with respect to user privacy, thus the data for each customer is siloed and cannot be exposed or transferred.
More specifically, the online identifiers (e.g. hashed cookie ID, hashed emails) will be shared with Advertising Networks, Data Management Platforms, and Data Analytics Providers.
This information is often accompanied by Internet/ Electronic network activity information, Geolocation Data, and Inferences.
At 1plusX we make sure that by providing this information the other party will be unable to re-identify a specific individual or household.
The information that we share with 3rd parties cannot be linked to a specific individual or household due to the hashing functions that we apply on the identifiers (e.g. cookie, login ID, email address).
The collection of the information allows 1plusX to move towards its business goal.
In that context, the main purposes for collecting the previously mentioned categories are:
Internet-based marketing
