==========
Cookies
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.
If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Etsy products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Etsy service.
Etsy uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: Access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Etsy's services; display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Etsy; estimate and report Etsy's total audience size and traffic; conduct research to improve Etsy's content and services.
Etsy cookies do not collect personal information, and Etsy does not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or email address is.
==========
Tracking Technologies
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information.
==========
The use of cookies by our third party tracking partners is not covered by our privacy statement.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Our partners use session ID cookies to support our site functionality such as web analytics reporting.
==========
Information Sharing and Disclosure
When you post a message, your Etsy ID or alias is visible to other users.
If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Etsy may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Etsy Terms of Use.
Etsy may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with Etsy's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as Etsy in Etsy's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

In such events, Etsy may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name.
Etsy may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.
Etsy is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them.
==========
These businesses may operate stores on the Etsy website or sell items to you from the Etsy website.
Etsy may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses.
Due to the nature of Etsy's business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, you will share customer information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business.
Etsy employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you.
Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.
==========
Etsy will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when Etsy has your permission.
It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Etsy's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law.
In some cases, Etsy may choose to buy or sell assets.
==========
In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.
Etsy will transfer information about you if Etsy is acquired by or merged with another company.
In this event, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Etsy web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another Etsy user's email address, shipping address and/or other information.
Pursuant to Etsy's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information.
This information should only be used for Etsy-related communications or for Etsy-facilitated transactions.
Etsy has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages.
Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Etsy user to your email or physical mail list.
==========
Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and Etsy's ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Etsy will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when Etsy believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect Etsy's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.
Forums / Chat Rooms
If you use a forum or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others or could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
Etsy is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
Third Parties
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Etsy collects from you.
If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on Etsy or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
==========
Etsy does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.

Security
The security of your personal information is important to us.

You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.
==========
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) for registration Etsy encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Etsy follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Etsy receives it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
==========
Therefore, while Etsy strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Etsy cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on Etsy's Web site, you can email Etsy at support@etsy.com.
