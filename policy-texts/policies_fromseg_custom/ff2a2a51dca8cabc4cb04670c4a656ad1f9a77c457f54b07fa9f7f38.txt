Overview
Bombora, Inc., its global subsidiaries (collectively, “Bombora”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) value the privacy of the persons (“you” or “your”) whose information we collect or receive.
This privacy notice (“Notice“) explains who we are, how we collect, use and share personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.
The Notice covers personal information we collect:
a) When providing information to the Bombora hosted platform and related analytics products.
b) When you visit one of our corporate websites (such as such as https://bombora.com, https://www.signal-hq.com/, https://www.netfactor.com/)) (“Website“) and/or over the usual course of our business practices, such as in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities (see ‘privacy for our websites’).

Data subject request form
1.
Who we are
One of the primary ways Bombora collects data is from a proprietary data cooperative (“Data Co-op”).
The Data Co-op consists of business to business (“B2B”) websites of publishers, marketers, agencies, technology providers, research and event firms that contribute content consumption data to a massive pooled data set that details buyer intent.
Data Co-op members provide consent-based brand-anonymous data including Unique IDs, IP address, page URL and referrer URL, browser type, operating system, browser language, and engagement data such as dwell time, scroll velocity, scroll depth and time between scrolls.
==========
Engagement data validates that the reader is actually consuming the content and not quickly bouncing from the website.
Bombora collects all event data and dynamically indexes the content consumed to the Bombora topic taxonomy and aggregates that data at the company level.
The full data set is refreshed weekly.
==========
Bombora provides the following hosted platform and related analytics products (collectively the “Services”) to its Clients.
1.1 Company Surge® Analytics
An analytics report listing company name, topic and Company Surge® score.
To create the score Bombora collects, stores, organizes, uses and erases data which is anonymized and aggregated such that no personal data exists.
Bombora will not disclose any data to a company other than company name, topics searched, and Company Surge® score.
These reports are created by collecting data from tags on publisher websites.
The tag collects IP address (which is anonymous and converted to company URL), engagement metrics, and topics (which are determined by real time algorithm).
The topics (based on Bombora’s B2B taxonomy) are attributed to company name.
Comparing topic interest over 30B interactions using our proprietary algorithms leads to a score.
That score is the company’s interest level in the topics compared over time.
==========
1.2 Audience Solutions
Audience Solutions and measurement products append data to and share a cookie id in the audience segment.
The data Bombora appends to the cookie id is firmographic and demographic data at the domain and company level only.
The firmographic and demographic data may include industry, functional area, professional group, company revenue, company size, seniority, decision maker and predictive signals.
Bombora does not share any data which could be used to identify an individual data subject.
In addition, Bombora prevents co-mingling of attributes that might have the effect of identifying an individual, such as a c-suite job level at a company size less than 10 people.
==========
Facebook integration: as more fully described in ‘‘what we do and collect and why’.
Through the Bombora integration with Facebook, Bombora uploads audiences associated with domains into Facebook.
Facebook matches these hashed emails against their database of users to create a custom audience for targeting.
LinkedIn integration: Through the LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform API, Bombora sends Company Surge® Intent data as a list of domains into LinkedIn.
LinkedIn matches its users to domains to create a matched audience for targeting within the LinkedIn Ad Platform.
==========
1.3 Measurement Products
The following Measurement suite of products collect demographic and firmographic information:

Audience Verification.
With our Audience Verification product, a client places a tag on their campaign creative.
The audience verification tag is able to collect the following data insights on visitors that click the advertisement: Unique cookie IDs, IP address and information derived such as geography, User agent: browser type and operating system (OS).
Visitor Insights: With our Visitor Insights product, a partner places a tag on their website (Bombora has our tag on our Websites).
The visitor insights tag is a able to collect insights about website visitors, including but limited the following data (i) Overall visitor engagement segmented by high, medium, and low percentages; (ii) Overall visitor engagement compared to previous date ranges; (iii) Total companies, unique users, sessions and page views; (iv) Total companies, unique users, sessions and page views compared to previous date ranges; (v) Engagement by company domain segmented by high, medium, and low and (vi) Unique users, sessions, and page views by company domain.
This data can be delivered through the Bombora interface, from a daily feed, or directly from the Google Analytics platform.
Visitor Track – Visitor Track is used along with certain software tools, such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information.
We do this in order to analyze traffic to our Website, and to better understand the needs of our customers and visitors.
Some examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (“IP”) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) referring page to our Website along with each page viewed, including date and time.
Through the Services, Bombora provides data to our Clients to help them better connect and target organizations they want to reach (we refer to the individuals in those organizations as “End Users“).
Bombora and its partners engage in tracking End Users’ interactions with business-to-business content across various digital properties like web registration forms, widgets, websites and webpages (whether accesses via computer, mobile or tablet device or other technologies) (“Digital Properties“).
We then take this data and aggregate the information collected into demographic segments, such as company revenue and size, functional area, industry, professional group, and seniority.
This helps Clients customize engagement based on topics that organizations are interested in and the intensity of that consumption.

==========
Privacy for our services
This section describes how we collect and use information we receive or collect from End Users through the Services (we refer to this collectively as “Service Information“).
This includes details about the type of information we collect automatically, the types of information we receive from other sources and the purposes of those collections.
2.1 What information do we collect and why?
Information we collect automatically
We use and deploy various cookies and similar tracking technologies (see ‘cookies and similar technologies’ ) to automatically collect certain information about your device when you interact with Digital Properties that use our technology.
Some of this information, including your IP address and certain unique identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device and may be considered “personal data” in certain jurisdictions including in the European Economic Area (“EEA“).
However, Bombora does not collect any information that enables us to identify you personally such as your name, mailing address or email address.
We collect this information by assigning a random unique identifier (“UID“) to your device the first time you interact with a Digital Property that uses our technology.
This UID is then used to associate you with information we collect about you.
The information we automatically collect may include:

Information about your device such as the type, model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address and unique identifiers assigned to your device such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID).
Information about your online behavior such as information about the activities or actions you take on Digital Properties we work with.
This may include time spent on a web page, whether you scroll or click on an ad or a web page, session start/stop time, time zone, your referring website address, and geo-location (including city, metro area, country, zip code and potentially geographic co-ordinates if you have enabled location services on your device) pages and times visited.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it and the number of times you have seen the ad.
==========
Information we receive from other sources
We may also combine, merge, and/or enhance the information we collect about you.
This can include the information we collect about you with information collected from third parties such as other web-based and mobile networks, exchanges and websites (“Partners“) or our Clients (for example, they may upload certain “offline” data into the Services).
View a list of our current partners.
In addition, the Service Information we automatically collect may be combined and associated with business profile information that we infer about you, such as: age, domain, functional area, household income, income status & changes, language, seniority, education, manufacturing, professional group, industry, company revenue, net-worth.
This information may include hashed identifiers derived from other information such as email addresses, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data (like your industry, employer, company size, job title or department) and content viewed or actions taken on a Digital Property.
==========
We use the Services Information as follows:

To provide the services to our Clients.
Generally we use the Service Information to help Clients better understand their current and prospective customers and market trends.
This enables Clients to better target and customize websites, content, other general marketing efforts and to measure and optimize the performance of their marketing.
==========
To build various inferenced data segments (“Data Segments”).
We may use the Service Information to build Data Segments related to, for instance, the industry you are in or the type of content you or the organization you work for appear to be interested in.
We use these Data Segments to help our Clients understand their own customers, evaluate customer and market trends and create reports and scoring regarding their customer’s behavior.
The Data Segments also may be associated with UIDs, cookies and/or mobile device advertising IDs.
To do “interest-based advertising”.
We sometimes use or work with Clients and Partners that use UIDs or other information derived from information such as email hashes.
==========
This information in turn may be associated with cookies and may be used to target ads to you that are based on “offline” interest-based segments – such as your interests, transactions or demographic information – or used by Clients that target and analyze such ads.
This is often known as “interest-based advertising.”
You can find out more about this type of advertising at the DAA’s website.
To do cross-device tracking.
==========
We (or our Partners and Clients we work with) may use the Service Information (e.g. the IP addresses and UIDs) to try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets or other devices), or work with providers that do this in order to better target ad campaigns to common sets of End Users.
For example, a brand may wish to target customers that it usually recognizes on web browsers through mobile apps.
To do “user matching”.
We (or our Partners) may use the Services Information, in particular various UIDs, to sync cookies and other identifiers with other Partners and Clients (i.e. to do “user matching“).
For example, in addition to the UID’s an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of UIDs our Partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.
When we identify matches, we then let our Clients and Partners know in order to help them do any of the above, including enhancing their own data and Data Segments, to do interest-based advertising or provide insights to other customers.
For instance, we use Facebook Custom Audiences to do user matching
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate:
a) under applicable law including laws outside your country of residence
b) to comply with legal processes
c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including authorities outside your country of residence
d) to enforce our terms and conditions
e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates
f) to protect yours, our affiliates and/or our rights, privacy, safety or property
g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
To evaluate, operate or improve the Services.
2.2 Cookies and similar technologies
Our Partners, our Clients and we use various UIDs, cookies and similar tracking technologies to automatically collect information from End Users across various Digital Properties (as previously described above).
Please review our Cookie Statement for further information.

==========
California “Do Not Track”
California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal.
