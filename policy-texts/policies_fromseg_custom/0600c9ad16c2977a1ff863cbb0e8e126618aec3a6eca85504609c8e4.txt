Buying and Selling Generally
Prohibited Transactions.
When buying a product using the Service, in addition to the limitations in our Prohibited Items and Prohibited Conduct policies, Buyers also must not place orders without the intent to purchase, purchase goods for a commercial purpose (e.g., resale), or place any order that is determined by Mercari to be fraudulent or illegal.
==========
You agree that the Service may only be used for bona fide purchases of goods, and may not be used to transfer money between a Buyer and Seller that is unrelated to a purchase of goods.
A Seller shall not purchase a product they themselves have listed on a separate Account.
==========
A Seller who wishes to withdraw or remove a listing must do so per the procedures specified by Mercari in the Help Center.
Sales Contract.
A sales contract for a product is formed with the Seller when the Buyer completes the steps for purchasing a product as prompted on the Service, but before payment is made by the Buyer.
The Seller and the Buyer shall not assign to a third party, provide as security, or otherwise dispose of their rights and obligations arising under such sales contract.
Mercari’s Role.
Seller agrees that Mercari and its designated payment processor act as agents for the Seller in processing payments for purchases.
A Buyer’s obligation to a Seller for the purchase price shall be deemed extinguished upon receipt by Mercari of the purchase payment (except for Buyer’s obligations in the event of a chargeback or other payment reversal) and rating.
==========
Once a product has been received by a Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly rate the Seller.
Once the Buyer has rated the Seller, the Seller shall promptly rate the Buyer.
Ratings need to be provided by the Buyer and the Seller in order for the Seller to receive his or her earnings.
If the Buyer does not rate the Seller within the designated time frame, Mercari will automatically rate the Seller in order to avoid continued delays in payment completion.
This automated rating releases the payment to the Seller.
Settlement to Sellers.
==========
When ratings by both a Buyer and a Seller are complete, Mercari and its designated payment processor will process the payment to Seller.
Mercari will make commercially reasonable efforts to credit Seller’s earnings balance with Mercari within ten (10) business days of receipt of the settled payment proceeds by Mercari.
Mercari shall initiate the transfer of balance earnings to Seller’s bank account upon Seller’s request using Direct Deposit or Instant Pay.
Mercari may ask for Seller’s User Information to ensure the transfer and purchase is secure, and may retain the earnings until Seller’s User Information has been verified and confirmed.
Mercari may also hold funds if it receives a notice of fraud, chargeback, invalid account information, court order or governmental request.
For more information on our payment procedures, please refer to the Help Center.

Fees Generally
All final fees associated with a transaction and/or shipping are communicated to the User at the time of transaction.

If you are eligible for Instant Pay to withdraw your balance to a debit card rather than direct deposit, Mercari charges a $2 processing fee per Instant Pay transaction.
==========
Cancellation Fees.
If a Seller cancels a transaction after the purchase has been initiated but before the transaction is completed, Mercari may charge a cancellation fee of 5% of the item price but no more than $25 maximum.
This will be subtracted from your balance and/or charged to the credit card on file within 30 days after you receive a notification from us.

Cancellation of a Transaction; Refunds
Cancellation of a transaction is not permitted once the product has been ordered by a Buyer, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
However, Mercari may allow cancellation of an order if the Buyer does not make a payment or does not pay on time; the Buyer receives an item that is not as described in the listing, is sent the wrong item, or is sent a damaged item; if the Seller does not ship within the expected time frame; or for other reasons Mercari deems appropriate.
If a Buyer receives an item that’s damaged, not as described in the listing, or if they are sent the wrong item, the Buyer must report the problem to Mercari within 72 hours of receipt of the item, or within such a longer time as required under applicable law.
Buyer may use “Contact Us” from the applicable Help Center article or initiate a report directly on their item.
==========
The Buyer must NOT rate the Seller if there is an issue.
If Mercari allows, items may be returned to the Seller for a refund.
Items that are hazardous or illegal are not eligible and shall not be returned to the Seller.
==========
Refunds will be issued to the original form of payment, unless a return of the item is not required, the item is not eligible for a return or if a refund is requested after the payment was processed to the Seller.
A Mercari credit may be issued in lieu of a refund to the original form of payment if the Buyer is no longer eligible for a refund, or payment to Seller has completed.
Additionally, refunds under a certain dollar amount may be issued in Mercari Credit rather than requiring a shipping return to the Seller at Mercari’s discretion.
==========
We do not provide refunds or returns for prohibited items.
Transactions where payment is sent outside of the Mercari platform are strictly prohibited by Mercari’s Terms and do not qualify for Mercari protections or refunds.

Use the earnings balance to purchase goods on Mercari.
Mercari and/or its banks or processors may impose additional limitations on the dollar amount or frequency of bank deposits or use of earnings; these limitations are subject to change without notice.
==========
Mercari limits Instant Pay to $500 total per month until you meet certain conditions, including completing verification of User Information.

Taxes
In general, items purchased by, and shipped to, Buyers in U.S. locations and charges for shipping may be subject to applicable Transaction Taxes (“Taxes”).
Taxes are not included in the listed price for any item(s) listed by Sellers; rather Taxes will be separately stated and added to the order total during checkout, if applicable.
Tax amounts may vary based on a few factors such as the nature of the item(s) purchased, the delivery location and the tax rate in effect at the time of the transaction.
The tax rate is a combined rate based on the total state and local rates of the location where the item is delivered.
==========
Mercari will collect Taxes from Buyers on behalf of Sellers where required, specifically in those states that require marketplaces to collect Taxes on behalf of Sellers.
The collected Tax amounts will be reported by Mercari and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of Sellers.
Sellers are responsible for any and all Taxes except to the extent Mercari chooses or is required to calculate, collect, report and remit such Transaction Taxes according to applicable law.
If you qualify for an exemption from sales tax, Mercari will accept valid tax exemption documentation entitling such exemption holders to purchase on Mercari without paying sales tax.
Refer to our Sales Tax Policy for information on how to submit your tax exemption documentation.
Alternatively, Buyers may be able to receive a credit for sales tax paid to Mercari directly from your state.
Please consult a tax advisor or your state Department of Revenue as policies differ for each state.
You hereby agree to comply with any and all applicable tax laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Service, including reporting and payment of any taxes arising from a payment transaction or income received through sales made through the Service.

ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.

The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
==========
Costs of Arbitration.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
For claims under $10,000, Mercari will reimburse you for all arbitration fees, including the initial filing fee, if you are deemed the prevailing party by the arbitrator.
==========
Severability.
With the exception of any of the provisions in this Policy, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this policy is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Policy shall still apply.
If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in this Policy ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this section shall be null and void.

==========
Mercari will collect Taxes from Buyers on behalf of Sellers where required, specifically in those states that require marketplaces to collect Taxes on behalf of Sellers.
The collected Tax amounts will be reported by Mercari and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of Sellers.
Sellers are responsible for any and all Taxes except to the extent Mercari chooses or is required to calculate, collect, report and remit such Transaction Taxes according to applicable law.
You hereby agree to comply with any and all applicable tax laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Service, including reporting and payment of any taxes arising from a payment transaction or income received through sales made through the Service.
==========
For more information see our Sales Tax Policy.
Mercari may request certain information from you to comply with IRS reporting requirements, including but not limited to, completing W-9 taxpayer identification forms and submitting 1099-K sales reports when required to facilitate Mercari’s Tax obligations.
==========

Legal Disputes and Use of Arbitration
You and Mercari each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Mercari relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of these Terms, your use of or access to the Service, any goods sold, offered, or purchased through the Service, or any payments processed for goods sold, offered or purchased through the Service, SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, rather than through other legal proceedings in court, except that you may assert a claim in small claims court, if it meets the criteria for such.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit filed in court.
It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to limited review by courts.
You and Mercari agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Article.
==========
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
YOU AND MERCARI AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND MERCARI AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.
==========
Arbitration Procedures.
The assigned independent arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this or any other applicable Terms or Policies, any part thereof, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable.
==========
All arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable).
The AAA’s rules are available at http://www.adr.org.
A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at http://www.adr.org.
In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must also send a copy of the completed form to Mercari at the following address in order to initiate arbitration proceedings: Mercari, Inc.
==========
Attn: Compliance PO Box 60178, Palo Alto, CA 94306.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.
==========
The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Mercari User to the extent required by applicable law or regulation.
The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Costs of Arbitration.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
For claims under $10,000, Mercari will reimburse you for all arbitration fees, including the initial filing fee, if you are rendered an award by the arbitrator.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer Mercari makes to resolve the claim before an arbitrator was selected, then Mercari will pay User’s reasonable attorneys’ fees (not to exceed the actual amount of attorney's fees incurred by User) in addition to any substantive award.
Mercari will not seek its attorney's fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that User’s claim is frivolous.
==========
Severability.
With the exception of any of the provisions in this Policy, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this policy is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Policy shall still apply.
If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in this Policy ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this section shall be null and void.
