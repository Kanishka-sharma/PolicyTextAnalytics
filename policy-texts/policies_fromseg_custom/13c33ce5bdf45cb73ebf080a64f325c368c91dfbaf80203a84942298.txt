Privacy Policy
altitudedigital.com is committed to transparency and accountability in our privacy practices.
The following statement describes altitudedigital.com’s Privacy Policy as it relates to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information altitudedigital.com receives from users of http://altitudedigital.com (this “Site”) and altitudedigital.com’s online video advertising platform services (the “Services”).
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of the following:

About altitudedigital.com and Consumers
Altitude Digital is not in the business of collecting, using, or selling consumer data; however it does offer tools and technologies to advertisers and publishers that allow them to collect and use user data.
==========
This is done primarily to enable these buyers and sellers of online video-advertising space to try and ensure that the audience they desire sees their ads and that the advertising itself is delivered and the performance of the advertising can be analyzed.
Types of data that may be used for this purpose range from behavioral or interest-related information to geographical or demographical user data.
==========
Information Collected, and How It Is Collected
Personally-Identifiable Information.
altitudedigital.com does not collect personally-identifiable information in order to help our clients buy, sell, and deliver online video advertising.
“Personally-Identifiable Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other information that Altitude Digital.com collects may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you.
==========
There may be some opportunities, for example when you use this Site, where you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal details.
For example, if you were interested in becoming one of our clients or using our Services you could provide us with contact details through our Site.
Where we collect personally-identifiable information you will have clear notification of what we are doing so that you can choose not to provide it.
==========
Non-Personally-Identifiable Information.
Non-personally-identifiable information is information that, without additional information, cannot be linked to a specific individual by altitudedigital.com.
altitudedigital.com may collect non-personally-identifiable information while you are visiting our Site or the website of one of Altitude Digital.com’s advertisers or Web publishers (collectively, “altitudedigital.com Associates”).
For example, while providing the Services to website publishers, advertisers and those working for them, Altitude Digital.com may collect your IP address, Web pages that you visit, the time and date, and whether or not you clicked on various advertisements (collectively, “Web Surfing Data”).
==========

Sharing and Disclosure of Collected Information

altitudedigital.com may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform website-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, Web analytics, and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Services are used.
==========
These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.
altitudedigital.com may disclose information when necessary in cooperation with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
We will disclose any information about you to government or to law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including, but not limited to subpoenas), or to protect altitudedigital.com’s rights, property, or those of others.

Business Transfers.
In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that altitudedigital.com may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company or otherwise be reorganized or sold.
If that’s the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to your information.
==========
Security Precautions
altitudedigital.com makes efforts to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect.
We use various technologies, including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure security standards.
==========
altitudedigital.com treats data that is stored on its servers as confidential information.
altitudedigital.com has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs.
Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium.
==========
Therefore, although altitudedigital.com uses reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating its security measures does exist and none of our security measures should be viewed as a guarantee.
