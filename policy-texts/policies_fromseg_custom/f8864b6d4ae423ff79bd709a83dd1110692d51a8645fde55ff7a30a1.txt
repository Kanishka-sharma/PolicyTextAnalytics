The following statement describes the overall company practices of Crimson Tangerine Limited, including all advertising on our network of websites, as well as across other internal sites, and products and services that are offered by Crimtan (referred to as “Crimtan”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
This policy was created to let you know what information we collect when you visit our websites and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites, why we collect it, and how it is used.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Crimtan does not own or control, or to people that Crimtan does not employ.
WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
Crimtan may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a Crimtan website or the website of one of our business partners, including website owners, advertisers, and their representatives (collectively referred to as “Business Partners”).
This anonymous data includes information such as a consumer’s IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a consumer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a consumer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third-party advertising technology vendor.
We, and/or a third-party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels.
==========
In addition, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about a visitor as part of the registration process at our wholly owned websites or for our services (collectively referred to as “Crimtan Properties”).
Examples of the non-personally identifiable information that may be requested and collected with the visitor’s consent include age, gender, and interests.
None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as “non-personally identifiable data”), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual.
Consumers may elect not to allow us to use this anonymous data by following the Cookie Opt-Out procedures set forth below.
==========
Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
We do not ask for personally identifiable information on Crimtan Properties other than what is outlined below for the purpose of working with our Business Partners.
At some of the websites of our Business Partners, they may request and collect personally identifiable information about a visitor as part of their registration process.
Visitors to our Business Partners’ websites should review each Business Partner’s privacy policy.
==========
Other Information that is Collected
At some Crimtan Properties, including this one, Crimtan may collect personally identifiable information from individuals and companies who want to enter into a business relationship with Crimtan as a Business Partner (referred to as “Business Information”).
For example, we may request and collect Business Information from website owners who want to become part of the Crimtan network of websites.
Crimtan is committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all individuals and companies before the personally identifiable data is collected, and that they have opted-in to our use of their Business Information.
Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, and email address.
Crimtan maintains Business Information for the purpose of administering our Business Partner programs, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc.
We may share Business Information with third-parties who provide administrative services (these third-parties are also required to maintain the confidentiality of the Business Information), or to law enforcement or government officials, pursuant to a court order, as we deem necessary or appropriate.
HOW IS THIS INFORMATION USED?
==========
The non-personally identifiable data that Crimtan and/or its third-party advertising technology vendors collect are used to better target advertisements and offers to consumers across the different websites they visit within the Crimtan network of websites.
Crimtan may also use the non-personally identifiable data to better target content to consumers in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each consumer.
The data are also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different consumers.
In addition, the data may be combined with information collected from other sources so that we may better serve consumers with advertisements and offers that may be of interest to them.
==========
We may also share non-personally identifiable data with our subsidiaries and third-party partners for similar use.
Crimtan may retain non-personally identifiable data for up to 3 months.
After 3 months, we may store the non-personally identifiable data in aggregate form for up to 18 months.
==========
If a consumer elects to provide Crimtan with personally identifiable data, we may utilise such data for marketing purposes.
Consumers who have provided personally identifiable data may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the Data Opt-Out procedures set forth below.
The Business Information that Crimtan Business Partners provide to us for the purpose of entering or maintaining a business relationship with Crimtan are used only for the purpose of administering our Business Partner programs, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc., and are stored for as long as the normal course of business requires.
Sharing Information with Third-Parties
All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in confidence by Crimtan.
There are instances, however, in which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third-parties, as described below.
The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Crimtan on an anonymous basis.
With respect to personally identifiable information, Crimtan may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related to providing a Crimtan product or service.
Any third-party vendor so used will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Crimtan.
Crimtan may also share personally identifiable information with third-parties who enter into business relationships with us.
These business partners may include financial service providers (including credit bureaus and insurance agents); non-financial companies (including retailers, online and offline advertisers, membership list vendors, direct marketers and publishers); companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, and others.
We may also disclose information to a third-party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing such services ourselves.
==========
In such situations, we will provide our subscribers with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing.
Please note that Crimtan is very careful about which companies it does business with.
Crimtan may also disclose information we have collected when we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to:
Satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request
Enforce applicable Terms of Services including investigation of potential violations thereof
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues
Protect against imminent harm to an individual’s safety or rights
If Crimtan, or part(s) of the company, becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of a majority or all of its assets, any data we have collected may be one of the assets transferred.
==========
Third-Party Information Gathering
Our website or the advertisements we or our third-party technology vendors deliver may contain content or advertisements from third-parties or links to other websites, including those of our Business Partners.
These other sites and vendors may use their own cookies, pixels, and similar technologies to collect data or solicit information from you.
Crimtan is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such other websites.
Crimtan encourages our Business Partners, including those within our advertising network, to adopt privacy policies that fully inform the consumer about the Business Partner’s information collection practices, as well as their use of a third-party advertising network, and to offer choice regarding the advertising networks’ services.
We encourage you to read the posted privacy policies of our Business Partners and whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website.
Similarly, we do not have access to, or control of, the cookies that may be set by a third-party, including those of our Business Partners, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party.

Once we receive your transmitted information, Crimtan uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information.
