Effective as from 18 May 2010.
Spotify Limited, a company registered in the UK under number 06436047 (“Spotify”, “we” or “us”) wish to bring you the best music service available.
To be able to do this, and to offer you products and services available on the Spotify websites at http://www.spotify.com/ and other Spotify branded URLs (the ”Spotify Websites”).
Spotify will request some information from you and automatically collect information about your use of the Spotify Software Application, the Spotify Service (both as defined in the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use).
Further, Spotify will request information from other third party services if such services are activated via Spotify.
This policy (the “Spotify Privacy Policy”) describes what personal information we may collect from you and what we will and will not do with that information.

==========
How we collect and use personal information
 When you sign up for a Spotify account or purchase Spotify’s products and services available on the Spotify web page, we may ask you for certain personal information such as email address, postal address, age, gender and residence.
In addition, when you use the Spotify Software Application, Spotify Service and Spotify Websites, we will automatically receive information about your use of the application, service and website including personal information such as media that you access, queries you make, date and time of your request, your Internet protocol address, performance of your network and computer, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version.
Further, if you activate Spotify Social (as defined in the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use), we will receive and store your Facebook user name.
We will use your personal information (i) to provide the products and services that you have purchased or requested (including the display of customized content and advertising), (ii) to communicate with you concerning your account and customer service issues.

(iii) to personalize and improve the Spotify Software Application, the Spotify Service and the Spotify Websites, (iv) to ensure the technical functioning of our products and services, (v) to develop new products and services, and (vi) to protect the copyright-protected content of the Spotify Service (e.g. by limiting access to the Spotify Service content to users with a Spotify account).
If you have activated Spotify Social, we will share your Facebook user name and your Facebook profile picture to other Spotify users connected to Spotify Social.
Further, the default setting is that all your playlists (including created playlists, starred music and top lists) are visible for other Spotify users connected to Spotify Social.
If you do not wish for such use of your personal data taking place, you should not activate Spotify Social or adjust your Spotify Social settings.
