         Submitting 
        a WatchDog Report
TRUSTe created 
        the WatchDog Dispute Resolution Mechanism to provide you with a mechanism 
        for reporting and resolving privacy violations, misuse of the trustmark, 
        or specific privacy concerns pertaining to a member Web site.
We request 
        your name, email address, name of the Web site, URL, and description of 
        the privacy violation.
This information is used to look into the alleged 
        violation and bring it to a satisfactory resolution.
Certain personally 
        identifiable information like your name and email address may be shared 
        with the member site, but only if you indicate that we have your explicit 
        permission to do this by marking the appropriate boxes.
If you do not 
        give us your permission to share your personally identifiable information, 
        then we will not share it with anyone outside of TRUSTe.
However, in some 
        cases, this may limit our ability to successfully resolve your complaint.
Any contact information a user provides on the WatchDog page is optional 
        and will not be used for any other purpose than to investigate and respond 
        to your report.
·        
        For Licensees 
        Only
We also request 
        information within the For Licensees Only section.

        site is only accessible to TRUSTe licensees.

Either a username plus password, 
        or confirmation number is required to enter.

        are used to recognize you when you return and to allow you to access your 
        information.

        information for the site coordinator and other company personnel.
Contact 
        information includes name, email address, postal address, phone number, 
        fax number, and domain names.

        Coordinator should TRUSTe have to work with the site regarding implementation, 
        customer inquiries and other various reasons regarding the TRUSTe program.
This information also allows us to get in contact with the appropriate 
        people in order to conduct compliance reviews when appropriate.
In the 
        event there is a need for a compliance review, TRUSTe will notify the 
        site coordinator and gain their explicit consent to share the contact 
        information entered into the For Licensees Only section of the site with 
        a third party auditor only for the purpose of conducting the compliance 
        review.
TRUSTe will share the 
        contact information entered into this area of its web site if we are required 
        by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order 
        to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies,

        Join the Privacy 
        Partnership
Leading 
        online companies have come together along with TRUSTe to bring you the 
        Privacy Partnership campaign.
Though this grassroots campaign is the result 
        of the efforts of several companies, the information collected is used 
        solely by TRUSTe and is not shared with any of the privacy partners.
To demonstrate 
        support of the campaign, we ask companies who would like to add their 
        name to our list of supporters for name, email address, company name, 
        and URL.
The contact information requested when a company would like to 
        add its name to the list of supporters of the Privacy Partnership campaign 
        is used only to contact the supporter in direct regards to changes and 
        updates affecting the campaign.
The company name that is input is added 
        to the list of supporters, which is shown on the Web site, and is linked 
        to the URL that is entered.
==========
This 
        information is not used for any other purpose.

        Privacy Wizard
The TRUSTe Privacy 
        Wizard was designed to help you create a privacy statement.

        asks for information such as company name, Web site name and contact information.
It also asks questions in regards to your company’s information 
        collection practices.
The information that is entered into the Privacy 
        Wizard is used to generate a privacy statement, however, this information 
        is not saved or captured in any way by our servers.
