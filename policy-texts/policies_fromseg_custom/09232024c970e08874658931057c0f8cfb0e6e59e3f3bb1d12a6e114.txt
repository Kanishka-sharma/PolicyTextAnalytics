We take the privacy of our users very seriously.

If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at dpo@livinglymedia.com or in writing at: Privacy Director, Livingly Media, Inc., 201 Redwood Shores Parkway, Suite 300, Redwood City, CA 94065.
Online Privacy Standards.
==========
While there are limited official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at https://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy-online-fair-information-practices-electronic-marketplace-federal-trade-commission, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), and the Data Protection Act 1998 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the 27th of April 2016, General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
What This Policy Covers.
This policy covers Livingly Media’s treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or use our services.
We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address.
What This Policy Does Not Cover.
This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners and advertisers.
==========
In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you.
All of these sites operate independently of Livingly and they have their own privacy or security practices.
For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.
HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE

During the email newsletter registration process, we collect your email address.

As explained further in our Terms of Service, currently available at http://www.livinglymedia.com/terms-of-service/, you must be 13 years of age or older to register to use our website.

INFORMATION WE TRACK
Log Files.
Similar to many websites, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal information automatically and store it in web server log files.
This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole.
Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or members from which individual member identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.
==========
Cookies.
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, and what pages they view during their visit.
Similar to many websites, we store an encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you when you come back to our website without requiring you to log-in every time.
Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on our site.
==========
Our partners.
Some of our business partners may also use cookies on our site.
For example, some of our advertising partners may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
We have no access to or control over these cookies, and, as noted above, this privacy policy does not govern the use of cookies by our business partners or advertisers.
To be excluded from these services, please visit some of our partners’ websites and follow the instructions provided.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION
In Company Communications.
We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our websites as our primary means to inform our members of important service and promotional announcements.
Service-related Announcements.
We use your email address to deliver important service-related announcements.
==========
Example service-related announcements include: email verification during registration, requests for password reset, important security or server maintenance updates, software updates, upgrades, and new releases, or policy changes.
These service-related announcements are considered a fundamental part of our web service, and members cannot opt-out of these email announcements.
Promotional Announcements.
==========
In order to improve the experience for our users, we will offer you the ability to sign up for optional email communications, such as regular updates from our corporate website, or email alerts and newsletters for specific web guides.
These communications are enhancements to our service and are entirely optional.
We will ask for your consent before sending you promotional communications, and will make it easy for you to unsubscribe from these communications, either through the emails or though your member profile page.
==========
Site Statistics.
As noted above, we use information collected from our web log files to calculate and publish anonymous, non-personal, aggregate statistics that we believe our members are interested in viewing.
For example, we track and publish the total number of users who have viewed a particular web page.
We publish this data in aggregate form only, and do not tie it to any personally identifiable information.
For internal reporting and analysis.
As noted above, we use information gathered from log files and cookies to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and to gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole.
==========
We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.
HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION
WITH THIRD-PARTIES
Sharing, Renting, and Selling Information We Collect.
We will neither rent nor sell your personally identifiable information to anyone.
Occasionally we share anonymous, non-personal, or aggregate information about our user base with partners or advertisers, and we may publish these aggregate usage statistics on our website for the interest of our members.
We do not tie this shared or published data to personally identifiable information.
AS NECESSARY IN LEGAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Legal Requirements.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.
==========
HOW WE KEEP INFORMATION SECURE
Security of Account Information.
Your account information is password-protected.
We will not share your password with anyone.
Please do not share your password with anyone, and remember to change your password from time to time, to keep your account information secure.
==========
Network Security.
We have implemented a variety of commercially standard security technologies and procedures to protect information, including your personal information, stored in our computer systems from unauthorized access.
Please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Management Procedures.
We also maintain standard physical and electronic procedural safeguards that limit access to your personally identifiable information to our employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who, through the course of standard business activities, need to access your personally identifiable information.
==========
YOUR PERSONAL CHOICES
Receiving Communications.
If you subscribe to any optional promotional communications, you will be able to unsubscribe from through the emails we send you.
Editing / Deleting Member Account Information.
You can view information we may have collected from you during a user registration process in a member profile page, where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see fit.
You may also request deletion of your member account by emailing dpo@livinglymedia.com.
==========
HOW WE RESPOND TO “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS
Some internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference (the "DNT Signal") to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how websites should interpret DNT signals, nor a common definition of "tracking", we do not currently respond to DNT Signals on Livingly Media websites.
We engage in so-called online behavioral advertising on third-party sites (also sometimes called "retargeting" or “tracking”), through which information collected about the pages you visit on Livingly Media websites is used to display ads for Livingly Media services on third-party websites.
This information may uniquely identify a browser but is not personally identifiable.
==========
