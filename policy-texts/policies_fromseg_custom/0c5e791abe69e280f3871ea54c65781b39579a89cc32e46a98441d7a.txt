==========
We are committed to being transparent about the technologies we use, and we've outlined below how we use cookies when you visit our site www.economist.com.
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small snippet of text that a website asks your browser to store.
All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser.
Cookies can be removed in two ways: automatically, when they expire, or when you manually delete them.
We've included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies we use.
Does Economist.com use cookies?
Yes, with the primary purpose to make our website work more effectively.
What kinds of cookies does Economist.com use and why?
==========
We use different kinds of cookies for various reasons:
Session cookies - these are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you close your browser.
We use session cookies to grant access to content and enable commenting (things you have to log in to do).
Persistent cookies - these usually have an expiration date far into the future and thus stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them.
We use persistent cookies for functionalities like the "Stay logged in" tickbox, which makes it possible for registered users to return to the site without having to log in.
We also use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so we can improve the site for our customers.
This information is anonymised - when we look at the data, in other words, we look at patterns, but we do not see individuals' personally identified information (PII).
==========
What other cookies might I encounter on Economist.com?
There are also limited third-party cookies on the site.
These cookies could be session or persistent and are set by entities other than The Economist.
To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of third-party cookies to trusted partners of The Economist Group.
==========
For example, we currently allow:
Social sharing and login – When you register or log in to Economist.com with credentials from social networks like Facebook or Twitter, you authorise them to store a persistent cookie that will remember you and grant you access to our site every time you visit until it expires.
You can delete that cookie (and revoke the access it grants) by updating your preferences with each respective social network.
So if you no longer want to be able to log in through Facebook, you'll need to update your settings at Facebook.
==========
Audience measurement and validation - We use services such as Omniture, Chartbeat, and Google Analytics to understand how many people come and what is popular which helps us improve the website.
Additionally, we use tools like Quantcast and Comscore, to validate our understanding of that information for advertising.
No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored and site usage is always looked at on an aggregate (and anonymous) level.
Other functionality - we use Brightcove for our multimedia platform and Doubleclick (Google) for our advertising platform.
Those teams set cookies in order to control frequency and target advertising to the right section or geographic region.
We use third party data from validated third party sources (such as Bizo Private Audience Targeting), acquired through BlueKai Data Exchange, to enable us to target advertising by establishing a particular audience demographic based on cookie data.
These are validated by BlueKai, not by us.
==========
What kinds of cookies does Economist.com not use?
We do not use flash cookies (sometimes known as local shared objects or LSOs).
We do not allow third-party advertising networks to drop cookies on our site to behaviourally target advertising to our users, either.
Do any of the cookies that Economist.com use contain my personal details?
No.
==========
All the data contained in the cookies that we use is completely anonymous and doesn’t contain any personally identifiable information (PII).
Does Economist.com use cookies to sell customer information?
No.
==========
How can I delete or disable cookies?
If you want to delete or disable cookies, see: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies
To opt out of cookies from Google: www.google.com/privacy/ads
To opt out of cookies from Quantcast: www.quantcast.com/how-we-do-it/consumer-choice/opt-out
To opt out of cookies from Bizo: www.bizo.com/businessProfessionals/opt_out
Will the site work if I disable cookies?
You can browse Economist.com with cookies disabled, though some interactions may not work.
==========
For example, ticking the “Stay logged in” box at login will not actually keep you logged in to the site unless you have enabled cookies.
Why does the message explaining cookies keep appearing?
If you close the banner and it reappears the next time you visit us, you most likely have cookies disabled.
We use a persistent cookie to remember that you closed the banner, but this only works when cookies on our site are enabled.
==========
What are the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA) and Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)?
The European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA) is the single authoritative voice on advertising self-regulation issues.
It promotes high ethical standards in commercial communications by means of effective self-regulation, while being mindful of national differences of culture, legal and commercial practice.
==========
The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) is comprised of more than 500 leading media and technology companies that are responsible for selling 86% of online advertising in the United States.
The IAB educates marketers, agencies, media companies and the wider business community about the value of interactive advertising.
Working with its member companies, the IAB evaluates and recommends standards and practices and fields critical research on interactive advertising.
Why have The Economist signed up to the EASA and IAB?
==========
We want to make sure it is as simple and straightforward as possible for our readers to manage their preferences.
EASA is becoming an industry standard and reflects the same high ethical standards for which we strive.
For more information on cookies, see: www.allaboutcookies.org
For more information on EASA, see www.easa-alliance.org
The IAB is committed to the continued growth of the interactive advertising ecosystem in tandem with ethical and consumer-friendly advertising practices.
==========
The IAB Board of Directors is authorised not only to develop and maintain this Code of Conduct, but to also establish and implement procedures and guidelines for the purpose of determining when violations or failures occur and for allowing the Members to participate in a resolution and remediation process that is both reasonable and fair to the Members and the industry in which the Members do business.
For more information on the IAB code of conduct, see: www.iab.net/public_policy/codeofconduct
What changes have been made to the cookies policy?
We first launched this on May 23rd, 2012 and the change made on April 5th, 2013 includes:
We are now members of the IAB
We added some cookies for functionality (for example the Bizo cookie mentioned above)
We broadened the array of our targeting possibilities, including allowing re-targeting cookies (all anonymous)
We added opt out links for Google, QuantCast and Bizo cookies
