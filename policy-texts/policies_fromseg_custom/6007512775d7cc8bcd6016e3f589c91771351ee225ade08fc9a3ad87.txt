In order to use the Google +1 button, you need to have a public Google Profile visible to the world, which at a minimum includes the name you chose for the profile.
That name will be used across Google services and in some cases it may replace another name you’ve used when sharing content under your Google Account.
Google may display your Google Profile identity to people who have your email address or other identifying information.
