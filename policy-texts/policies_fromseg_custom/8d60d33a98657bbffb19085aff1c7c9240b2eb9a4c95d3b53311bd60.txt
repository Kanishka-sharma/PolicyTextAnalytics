Webshots Privacy Policy

Webshots is committed to protecting the privacy of its users, and making 
your Webshots experience enjoyable and safe.
Our data collection policies with regard to current and 
future services allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and to control how we use 
that information.
Read below to find out more.
Privacy Philosophy

The Internet is rapidly changing the way we communicate and interact with each other.
While the Internet 
allows us access to a greater array of information and services than has ever been available, these 
new online activities do raise new challenges, such as the privacy issues addressed in this policy.
==========
Having a relationship with our customers that is founded on trust is not only good manners, it is also 
good business.
Any feedback you'd like to provide to help us better meet your expectations in this arena 
is welcomed.
Webshots wants to make your online experience satisfying and safe.
Our goal is to provide 
you with a robust online experience while allowing you to control your privacy.
Webshots collects information 
online primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.
We request information 
from you in order to provide our strongest value to you - a personalized online experience.
Customers 
who personalize our service come back more often - and it's the customers that visit us often who make 
us successful - so we do everything we can to make Webshots your service with your name on it and to 
give you just the content you want.
Information We Collect

Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:

Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual.
==========
For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily 
know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.
What we collect from transactions such as 
this constitutes anonymous information, much like how your hometown's bus service knows how many people 
take a given route - but doesn't necessarily know who those people are.
Many of the individuals who 
access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore 
those individuals are anonymous to us and the data we collect is similarly anonymous information.
Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that is unique to you, such as your 
name or email address.
In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced 
service that you have requested.
==========
An example of the use of such information would be the Webshots eCards.
We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to judiciously provide Personally 
Identifiable Information to Webshots so that we may provide more valuable content and products to you.
The only way we know something about you personally is if you register as a user on our site.
In other 
words, we will know Personally Identifiable Information about you only if you choose to share this type 
of information with us.
==========
Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times 
to provide information such as your name, email address, or information about what you like and do not 
like.
On other occasions such as when we provide items for purchase online, we may request your credit 
card number to conclude the transaction, or your mailing address to ensure proper delivery.
Third Party Advertisers

We periodically use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.
In the 
course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a 
unique "cookie" on your browser.
(More information about cookies is provided below.)
These companies 
may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your 
visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about 
goods and services that may be of interest to you.
==========
Our Commitment to Your Family

Like you, we at Webshots have children of our own and are concerned about their safety when they use 
the Internet.
We want you and your family to be safe while visiting Webshots.
That is why we have established 
a special policy with regard to the use of our services by children.
The Federal Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) requires that service providers never knowingly request Personally Identifiable 
Information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting verifiable parental consent.
In accordance 
with COPPA, Webshots does not knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from children 
under the age of 13.
No one under the age of 15 should submit any Personally Identifiable Information 
to our Site.
In the event that Webshots determines that a user of this site is under the age of 13, 
Webshots will not maintain or use his or her Personally Identifiable Information.
==========
To ensure children's 
privacy, we urge parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to become familiar with 
the types of content available on the Internet.
Control tools are available on the Internet from online 
services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.

information on protecting children's privacy, visit

==========
Our Use of Personally Identifiable Information

We are committed to making your Webshots experience enjoyable and safe.
When you download our software 
or photos, register for our online services, or send our eCards or Photo Messages, the information you 
provide to us is used to customize your experience and to deliver email notifications to you (or people 
you designate as your recipients).
The names and email addresses you give us are NOT sold, compiled 
into any type of mailing list, or otherwise used for any type of email solicitation.
We may use the 
information we collect to complete the purchase and delivery of products or services you order from 
us, to continuously improve this site and our business, and to customize and improve your online experience.
We may at times send you information regarding important changes to your account or our service.
We 
may also send you news, updates and other information you may find useful, unless you specify in your
account that you do not want to receive these notices.
==========
Except as described below, we do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties.
We may share your information with our business partners and agents (such as Federal Express) only 
 to the extent necessary to complete the purchase and delivery of your order.
In the event that all or part of our business is sold or pledged as security, we may transfer the 
 information we collect on this site to third parties in connection with that transaction.
We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate for any of the following 
 purposes: to comply with the law or a request by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities; 
 to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect 
 the rights, property, or safety of Webshots, our customers or others.
This does NOT include selling, 
 renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing Personally Identifiable Information for commercial purposes.
==========
Cookies

To enable many of the features provided by Webshots, we will assign "cookies" to your Internet browser 
(such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer).
A cookie is a small text file that contains 
a unique identification number stored on your computer.
Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find 
out the identity of any user.
This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser 
- but not you - to our computers whenever you interact on our site.
When you visit our site, a cookie 
in effect says to our server computers, "Hello, I'm browser #655.
What do you do just for me?"
==========
Every 
Web page that you access that includes advertising or content served from Webshots will have the contents 
of your cookie reported in our server logs.
Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works 
today, and allow server computers to recognize your computer's browser when you return.
If you have 
ever gone to a Web page that automatically provides personalized content without you having to "sign 
in," this is almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie.
Since cookies are only text files, they 
cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability to search for or transmit other information from your 
computer.
==========
Security of Information

Webshots operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection 
systems.
Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and 
only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.
Any particularly 
sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, 
is encrypted prior to transmission.
==========
You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of 
your Webshots Username and password.
Please take care to store your Webshots Username separately from 
your account password, or better yet, choose a password that you don't need to write down at all.
How You Can Correct any Inaccuracies

Webshots believes strongly in providing you with the ability to access and edit the personal information 
that you have provided to us.
To update the information retained about you, please visit your Webshots
Account.
==========
General

If you choose to visit our Web site, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy 
Policy and our Terms of Use including limitations on liability, arbitration 
of disputes, and application of the law of the United States and the state of California.
This Privacy 
Policy is subject to change at any time.
Any changes will be set forth on this page.
