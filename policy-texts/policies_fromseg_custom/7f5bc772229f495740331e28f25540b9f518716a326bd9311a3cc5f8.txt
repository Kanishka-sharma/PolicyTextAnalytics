B. ONLINE INFORMATION COLLECTION
1.
==========
Personal Information
You can visit and browse the Edward Jones Web site and find out
about our services, check on career opportunities, get a quote
update, and access other information without providing Edward Jones
with your personal information.
Edward Jones collects personal
information when it is voluntarily submitted by clients or
visitors.
This information is used by Edward Jones and its
affiliates to offer you the highest level of service, complement
our marketing and research efforts, and ensure compatibility among
top browsers.
==========
Personal information may also be used in aggregate
for us to learn about our Internet-using customers.
Personal
information you provide online is not disclosed to external
organizations, other than businesses who provide services on behalf
of Edward Jones, unless we are required or permitted to do so by
law.

==========
IP Addresses
Edward Jones Web servers collect your Internet Protocol (IP)
address for the purpose of system administration and internal
reporting of aggregate information.
We use this information to
improve our Web site, develop marketing, monitor Web site
performance, and better meet client needs.
When you request pages
from our Web site, our servers log your IP address.
Using IP
addresses, we can determine the domain names of Internet service
providers (ISPs) used to access the Edward Jones Web site.
The
domain names are not personally identifying, which means that --
with the exception of AccountLink users -- a Web site visitor's
session is logged, but remains anonymous.

For the purposes of improving our service and adhering to
