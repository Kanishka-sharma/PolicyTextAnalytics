Six core privacy principles guide our data practices and operations at Mozilla.
These principles stem from the Mozilla Manifesto.
In short, we're a non-profit dedicated to putting the user in control and shaping the future of the Web for the public good.
These principles remind us that our users’ interests come first and encourage us to build a consistent approach to privacy and security:
No Surprises Only use and share information about our users for their benefit and as spelled out in our notices.
==========
Limited Data Collect and retain the least amount of user information necessary and share data anonymously whenever possible.
Real Choices Educate users at the point that we collect any data and give them the option to opt out whenever possible.
User Control Innovate, develop and advocate for privacy enhancements that put users in control of their online experiences.
Sensible Settings Establish default settings that balance safety and user experience appropriately for each transaction.
==========
Trusted Third Parties Make privacy a key factor in selecting and interacting with partners.
We know how much you value your privacy, so we try to collect as little information about you as possible.
Our privacy policies explain in detail exactly what our different products will and won't do with your information.
If you want to know exactly what gets collected when and for what reason, then be sure to check the relevant policy.
==========
Types of Information
Aggregate Data Non-Personal Information Potentially Personal Information Personal Information
Information recorded about people and collected into groups so it no longer references an individually identifiable person.
Information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.
Aggregate or non-personal information that could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify a person.
Information that a person provides to us that personally identifies him or her.
Overview of Information Uses
We collect non–personally identifying information, like your browser type, and potentially personal information, like your IP address, to understand how our sites are being used and how to improve them.
You can learn more about modifying your settings with regards to this practice in Your Choices.
We may ask for personal information, like your mailing address, when we need to ship you stuff, like a Mozilla membership card or an awesome t-shirt, or to detect and prevent fraud.
Sometimes, we post or share aggregate, non-personal information with our community to enhance their ability to improve Mozilla’s products and services.
==========
We collect non-personally identifying information contributed to us by our users on an opt-in basis for research and product-improvement purposes, like in Test Pilot.
We never share personal information publicly if we promised to keep it confidential at the time of collection unless we have your express permission to do so.
We sometimes share information with employees, contractors, subsidiaries, contributors or other people working with or for us.
We always endeavor to make them promise not to disclose or use that information except for Mozilla-related or non-commercial purposes.
We always try to put information in non-personally identifying forms when we can.
==========
When you give us suggestions, comments, and questions about our sites and products, we sometimes make them viewable by other people, and they may get re-posted on other sites.
Please don't include personal information when you submit comments and feedback, or when you post questions or answers on our support site!
Analytics
We use web analytics software to keep track of how many visitors we have, which links are most popular, and other information about how people use Mozilla websites.
We use this information to help make our sites more useful and usable.
If you don't want your session visit information on our websites to be collected and analyzed by Mozilla (or its third-party analytics providers), you can use the opt-out mechanisms.
Advertising
We think that we make great stuff, and we think that folks can get a lot out of using it, so we sometimes advertize on other sites.
==========
If you have enabled Do Not Track in your browser, our ads on other websites will honor your request not to be tracked.
For those who are using a browser without DNT, like older versions of Firefox or browsers produced by other vendors, we provide an opt-out cookie that you can install by visiting this page.
Email
If you signed up to receive a newsletter or other email communication from Mozilla, but no longer wish to do so, you can opt out from receiving them by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the next email you receive.
==========
Do Not Track
Do Not Track is a feature in Firefox (and some other sweet browsers) which lets you tell websites that you'd rather that they don't keep track of you thankyouverymuch.
You can read more about Do Not Track and how to turn it on in Firefox at http://dnt.mozilla.org.
Other Stuff
In all the stuff we make, there are a bunch of privacy and security settings and a whole load of functionality.
==========
There are also plenty of add-ons which you can use to get even more control over your online experience, interactions and information: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/privacy-security/
It takes a lot of work to bring you our many websites, products and services, but Mozilla can’t take all the credit.
We work with a number of third party service providers who we expect will respect your privacy and security.
Each of our third-party providers is under a licensing agreement with Mozilla.
==========
This agreement does three things:
It prohibits the release of personal or potentially personal information to the public.
It allows each provider to use this information only in conjunction with the service or services it’s providing.
It prohibits the correlation of any user data with any information collected through that provider's other products, services or Web properties.
