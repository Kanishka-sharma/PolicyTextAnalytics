I. Overview and Important Definitions
    This Terms of Use ("TOU" or the "Agreement") is a legally binding contract between SEOmoz, Inc. ("Moz") and you, as a user of or subscriber to Moz sites or
    services.
The Moz Privacy Policy and Moz Community Etiquette are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
Moz offers businesses and individuals access to a rich collection of resources related to search engine optimization, online marketing, and online local
    business listing management, including, without limitation, search engine optimization tools, link analysis tools, downloadable toolbars, application
    program interfaces ("APIs"), website profile services, search analytics, blogs, user-generated content, personalized content, industry surveys, and opinion
    polls.
==========
Collectively, we'll refer to these resources as the "Services" in this Agreement.
Moz Services may be offered across a number of web domains, including, without limitation, Moz.com and MozCast.com.
We'll refer to these domains as the
    "Sites" in this Agreement.
==========
You may access the Sites or Services with a free account as a user ("User").
While access to certain portions of the Sites and selected features of the
    Services is free, Moz reserves the right to charge fees for features and benefits associated with the Sites or Services at any time.
A User who pays for any portion of the Sites or Services shall be referred to as either a "Subscriber" or "Customer" in this Agreement.
Now that we've gotten these definitions out of the way, let's talk about terms specific to certain Services, followed by terms relevant to all Users,
    Subscribers and/or Customers.
==========
II.
Conditions Governing API Usage
    Moz may offer APIs for use by third parties, such as the Mozscape API.
While Moz may not charge for Mozscape API use under certain circumstances, any such
    use is subject to these TOU.
If Moz enters a separately negotiated agreement with you related to Mozscape API use, these terms will still apply, but any
    conflicting terms in that agreement will override terms in this Section.
All data associated with a Moz API is proprietary to Moz.
If you use or publicly display such proprietary data associated with this API, you must comply
    with any link and attribution guidelines set forth on the Sites from time to time in addition to these TOU.
==========
Moreover, you may not resell or redistribute
    proprietary Moz API data via your own API or offer it to third parties.
Regarding the Mozscape API, you may access the Mozscape API via a secret key only.
You agree to assume responsibility for your secret key, regardless of
    whether you authorized use of this key to another.
Mozscape API keys are limited to one per user and one per organization, and abusing Mozscape API keys
    may subject you to liability, including as described in this agreement.
Moz reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to any API at any time and for any reason, with or without cause.
If your access to an API is
    suspended or terminated, you have no rights associated with such API and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to any remuneration or compensation
    of any kind.
==========
III.
Conditions Governing Moz Local Subscribers.
If you purchase Moz Local business locations from any of the Sites, you are subject to the following terms and conditions related to your purchase.
==========
If you
    purchase locations via a separately negotiated agreement, these terms also apply, but in case of any conflicts between that agreement and this TOU, the
    terms in the separately negotiated agreement will apply.
Moz Local Service Fees
    : You agree to make an immediate payment to Moz for each location for a recurring one year term (the "Term") which begins on the date of payment.
This
    payment, plus any future payment for that location based on annual renewal, shall together be referred to as "Moz Local Service Fees".
You understand that
    Moz assumes costs immediately after you submit data to Moz and acknowledge that as a result no partial or complete refunds will be issued by Moz to you -
    at any time, for any reason - once you have made a payment for Moz Local Services.
Scope of Moz Local Services
    : In exchange for your immediate payment per business location per year and compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Moz will distribute
    data to certain location data aggregators and business listing services and may offer additional reports and tools related to this data.
These services are
    described in greater detail on the Sites.
Taxes:
    You are responsible for all taxes associated with your purchase of Moz Local Services (such as sales tax), and such taxes will be in addition to the Moz
    Local Service Fees quoted.
==========
Renewal:
    Each business location will renew annually within 30 days of the anniversary of the initial payment for that location.
Once a renewal payment is processed,
    no refunds will be provided for any reason.
If your renewal payment fails, you will no longer have any rights under this Agreement related to your
    previously purchased Moz Local business location(s), including the right to manage your listing, until you are in good payment standing.
Failure to renew a
    listing in a timely manner (prior to the date of annual renewal) will result in loss of custom pricing terms associated with a business location, if any.
==========
Change in Moz Local Service Fees Upon Renewal:
    Moz may change its Moz Local Service Fees from time to time; with respect to renewals, Moz will provide no fewer than sixty (60) days of notice of such a
    change by electronic mail and/or posting of any new fee schedule on the Moz.com/local website.
Customer Management Of Each Business LocationCancellation:
    You may cancel management of a business location from the Moz Local dashboard only.
Cancellation is immediate and is not reversible and must be initiated
    prior to the expiration of any Term to avoid fees associated with renewal.
==========
Cancellation removes a listing and its associated data from your dashboard.
Changes and Updates:
    You may make unlimited changes and updates to data associated with a purchased business location during the Term.
However, if you make changes to core data
    - such as domain name, phone number, or location address - that Moz is unable to validate using third-party services such as Google or Facebook, Moz may
    not be able to update your changes with location data aggregators and business listing services following submission.
This validation policy protects you
    and other customers from having business locations listing data hijacked by unauthorized agents.
Additional Moz Local Customer Obligations and Acknowledgements:By purchasing Moz Local listings, you warrant and acknowledge that you own each listing or are otherwise authorized to represent the business location as
    of the date you make any payment of Moz Local Service Fees.
==========
You agree to review and confirm the accuracy of submitted information about a listing periodically throughout any Term.
You acknowledge that Moz may occasionally require you to submit proof of authorization to represent a Moz Local business location via email, and that
    failure to comply with such spot-checks may result in cancellation of your listing(s).
You acknowledge that your business location listing(s) may be
    transferred to another person or entity if that person or entity can reasonably demonstrate ownership of those business location(s), and this will not
    entitle you to a refund under any circumstances.
==========
You acknowledge that another agent may submit information to Moz Local or a location listing provider which may override information you submitted about
    a business location.
You acknowledge that the services contemplated by this Agreement involve sending location data to third party location listing providers who will then
    have the right to use this data in any way they wish, and Moz has no control over this data once it is pushed to third parties.
You acknowledge that location data aggregators and business listing services are not obligated to accept your listing, or any or all of the information
    you submit via Moz Local related to a business location.
You acknowledge that Moz reserves the right to change the mix of Moz Local location data aggregators and business listing services in current and future
    TOU at our discretion.
IV.
==========
Conditions Governing Subscriptions 
    Moz offers subscriptions to various software as a service products (Pro, Content, Analytics, FollowerWonk, etc.) and these terms govern such subscriptions.
Payment for Subscriptions 
    As a Subscriber, you must agree to the payment terms presented to you at the time you sign up for Services on the Sites.
You are responsible for taking action prior to renewal if you do not want your subscription to renew automatically.
You may not receive further notice of
    your renewal after signing up for a subscription, and you must visit your Subscription and Billing page to find out when your subscription is set to renew.
Subscriptions recur either monthly or annually in most cases, depending upon the renewal term you choose during the signup process.
==========
You are responsible for ensuring that the credit card associated with your account or subscription is up to date, that information posted in connection
    with it is accurate, and that you are authorized to use that credit card.
Moz reserves the right to implement fraud-protection measures including, without
    limitation, temporarily charging small amounts to your credit card to determine that it is a valid credit card and you are authorized to use it.
Cancellation of Subscriptions.
For security reasons, an email or phone call to Moz is not sufficient to cancel your Moz subscription, which you may cancel at any time by selecting the
    cancel button on your Subscription and Billing page.
==========
Cancellation does not entitle you to a refund under any circumstances.
You will continue to have
    access to the Sites and Services you have paid for until the end of your subscription term, but will lose access if the subscription is not in good
    standing.
No Refunds.
Moz is not obligated to provide you a refund at any time.
If you choose to cancel your Moz subscription during your subscription term, you will not be
    refunded, in whole or in part.
If you choose to downgrade your subscription during your subscription term, you may be entitled to a pay a lower, pro-rated
    amount as of the date of renewal, but you are not entitled to a cash refund at any time.
Multiple Subscriptions.
==========
Each Moz account has a single credit card associated with it.
If a subscription to one Moz service is suspended due to Moz inability to process that credit
    card, and you subscribe to a second Moz service while that first service is suspended (by, for example, changing the credit card associated with your
    account) but before it is cancelled (a period which is currently 18 days, but is subject to change), Moz reserves the right to use the valid payment method
    associated with the second service to reinitiate the suspended service.

    Pro account) may be dependent upon demonstrating that you have paid for the subscription or Sites.
You acknowledge that if you sign up for any Services and pay via credit card, and Moz cannot charge your credit card at renewal, Moz may cancel your
    subscription and you may lose access to the Services and any data associated with your subscription.
While some Services may be paid for via invoice by mutual written agreement by you and Moz, Moz reserves the right to quote additional fees for invoiced
    accounts.

    all undisputed invoices within 30 days.
You agree that Moz may charge interest of 1.5% per month for past due invoices, or the highest rate permitted by
    law, and you agree to be liable for reasonable attorney fees and collection costs arising from Moz's efforts to collect on past due amounts; If you fail to
    pay an invoice, Moz reserves the right to cancel your subscription, access to any Services, and any data associated with your subscription or the Services.

When you post User Generated Content to the Sites, you authorize and direct Moz to make such copies as Moz deems necessary to facilitate the posting and
    storage of User Generated Content on the Sites and provide the Services to you.
You further authorize Moz to anonymize and aggregate User Generated Content and any data you share with us (“User Data”), including data associated with

You authorize Moz to use such content and data, by way of example and not limitation, to enable Moz to
    provide current or future services and for benchmarking, research and development, data products, or other marketing purposes.
By choosing to post, upload,
    or transmit data to the Sites (including authorization to access any third party account or profile), you grant Moz, its affiliates and partners an

    time without notice.
You agree that Moz shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the

They may be revoked at any time, for any reason, at Moz's discretion.
==========
In no event shall
    credits ever be redeemable for cash, exchanged, sold, or rolled into a separate account.
Unused credits may expire at the discretion of Moz.
If, for example, Moz issues Services Credits for a referred account that is later deemed not to be an actual person or company, or the referred account is
    otherwise not in good standing, was fraudulently obtained, or later sought a refund for any payments associated with it, such Services Credits may be
    revoked and voided.

    the possibility of the damages.
Some states, provinces and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or
    exclusions may not apply to Users in these jurisdictions.
