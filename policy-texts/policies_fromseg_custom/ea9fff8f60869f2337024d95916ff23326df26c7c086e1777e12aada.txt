==========
Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to user IDs and specific items.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, postage and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments.
However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and postage information.
How you should use the information you receive on eBay
When you are in a transaction with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as his/her name, user ID, email address, contact details, postage and billing address) to complete the transaction.
We encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect his/her privacy.
==========
In all cases, you must give the other user a chance to remove himself/herself from your database and give him/her a chance to review what information you have collected about them.
You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, postage, fraud complaints and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates.
Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.

You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent.

If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.
We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information.
This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.

Law enforcement, legal proceedings and as authorised by law
to comply with our legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property or safety
to law enforcement or governmental agencies, or authorised third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay user to legal liability.
We will only disclose information we deem relevant to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, city, state, postcode, telephone number, email address, user ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, bidding and listing history, and anything else we deem relevant
to eBay VeRO Program participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion deem necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity.
In such events, we will disclose name, street address, city, state, postcode, country, phone number, email address and company name
to credit bureaus as authorised by applicable law (e.g. information on late or missed payments or other defaults on your account that may be reflected in your credit report)
to third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they provide us with a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, or we otherwise believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
People you authorise us to provide it to
eBay users as authorised by you or your use of our Services (e.g. if you buy an item, the seller may view your email address and request and obtain your contact information â including phone number or email and postal address â to help complete the transaction)

Important Information
There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:
When you share your personal information on eBay â what happens?
Other users have access to the information you share on eBay.
For example, other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the members and collections you follow, Storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments.
==========
Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.
Your user ID is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public.
It is connected to all of your eBay activity.
==========
Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to user IDs and specific items.
So if you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.
To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, postage and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments.
However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and postage information.
How you should use the information you receive on eBay
eBay enables you to obtain personal information of others to complete transactions and collect payments.
==========
We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users.
In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.
==========
Use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, for using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, postage and fraud complaints), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates.
Using personal information that you have access to for any other purpose is a violation of our policies.
Unwanted or threatening email
Sending unwanted or threatening email is against our policies and constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.
To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to spam@ebay.com or spoof@ebay.com.au.
==========
Third party privacy practices
This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you.
If you disclose your information to others, their privacy notices and practices will apply.
We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information.
This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.
==========
