3.2 Voluntary Data
If you wish, you may provide additional information about yourself apart from the mandatory data on a voluntary basis (hereinafter referred to as "Voluntary Data"), to allow other XING Members to get to know you better and possibly encourage them to choose you as an appropriate business contact.
At the moment, you are able to choose from the following Voluntary Data, for example: your interests, your education, companies you have previously worked for, what you have to offer to other XING Members, what you are looking for from other XING Members, etc.
You may also upload a photograph of yourself, if you wish.
==========
The Voluntary Data you choose to provide to XING is accessible to all other XING Members, unless the data is particularly identified.
With regard to such particularly identified data you may choose in each individual case if the data shall be displayed to a specific other XING Member.
3.3 Your Profile, Contact Management
The following sections of the Personal Data you have made available to XING is visible to all other XING Members:

First name, last name
Professional status
Company name
Position (Title)
Industry
Country, state and city of your company


All other XING Members may access your Profile and view the information displayed on the Profile, including such Voluntary Data you have specified to be made available to all other XING Members.
==========
Certain XING Members may be able to access further of your Voluntary Data in accordance with your specifications (chosen settings) for the respective XING Member in each individual case.
If you send XING Members a request for personal contact, these XING Members are then saved in your Profile on a contact list.
Should a XING Member confirm your request for contact, this XING Member shall be listed as a so called "confirmed contact".
Confirmed and unconfirmed contacts shall be registered separate from one another.
Other XING Members may only ever view your list of confirmed contacts.
XING has set your privacy settings under "Privacy" by default so that your list of confirmed contacts is displayed to all XING Members.
However, you may change this setting at any time by yourself to the effect that your list of confirmed contacts is not visible to anybody at all or only to certain of your contacts, for example to the direct contacts of your contacts (i.e. second level contacts) or only to third level or fourth level contacts.
==========
The following of your personal statistics are visible to all XING Members at all times:

Number of your confirmed contacts
Number of hits on your Profile
Month and year of your membership
Type of membership

On your Profile you will find a so-called activity meter.
This meter indicates whether you use the XING Services regularly.
However, it does not show any details about the way or the times you use the XING Services.
The activity meter is intended as an indication for other XING Members to determine how often you use the XING Services so that the other XING Members can evaluate whether you will presumably react quickly to a request via the XING Services.
==========
You may choose to hide the activity meter at any time in your privacy settings under "Privacy" so that the activity meter is not visible to other XING Members.
XING has provided a guest book on your Profile to invite other XING Members to leave a comment if they wish to do so.
Entries in the guest book are visible to all other XING Members.
XING has set your privacy settings under "Privacy" by default to the effect that a guest book is available and displayed to all XING Members on your Profile.
You may change this setting at any time in your privacy settings under "Privacy", if you prefer not to have a guest book on your Profile.
==========
Other XING Members may send you private messages in order to establish contact with you.
XING has set your privacy settings under "Privacy" by default so that all XING Members may send you private messages.
You may restrict the ability of XING Members to send you private messages at any time to the effect that either no XING Members or only selected contacts may send you private messages, for example only the direct contacts of your contacts (i.e. second level contacts) or only third level or fourth level contacts.
As you can see, XING gives you complete control over your own privacy at all times!
4.
==========
Visibility of your Profile to Non-Members of XING
Under "Privacy" you can set the level of your privacy at any time.
This means that you decide whether to increase your level of privacy or opt in favour of more visibility online, enabling more exposure of your profile for potential business partners.
When you register, your default privacy settings rather promote the spirit of networking.
The data contained in your profile is visible to non-members of XING and traceable by search engines on the Internet.
This, however, does not include personal contact details such as email addresses or phone numbers.
If you signed up to XING before 17.08.2007 the following regulation continues to apply:
Your profile is preset to be invisible to non-members of XING and not traceable by search engines on the Internet.
You can, of course, adjust these settings at any time.
However, please note that if you do release your profile to non-members or search engines, this will automatically mean that the following sections of your registration data are displayed to non-members of XING: First name, last name, professional status, position (title), previous companies and positions, industry, country, state and city of your company
If your profile shall be visible to non-members of XING or traceable by search engines on the Internet, such voluntary data that you have specified in the settings under "Privacy" to be visible to other XING members will also automatically be visible to non-members of XING.
==========
Finally, a maximum of four (4) of your confirmed contacts will automatically be visible, chosen at random.
You may prevent the display of these four (4) confirmed contacts at any time by changing the setting for the display of confirmed contacts under "Privacy" to any other setting than "all members".
5.
Groups
On the XING Websites, XING offers certain groups, forums and similar services.
.
==========
Each group has one (1) or more moderator(s).
The moderator decides for each group whether the group is public or whether it is only accessible to a specific group of people, as well as who has read and/or write access for each relevant group.
==========
This information will be displayed on the XING Websites for the relevant group.
It is visible to XING Members and it may also be visible to non-members of XING, depending on the settings chosen by the moderator.
Please note: where a group is specified as "public" on the XING Website and in the event that the moderator has not restricted the access rights to the group, all contributions of XING Members to such a group can be read by all other XING Members, and these contributions are then also accessible to non-members of XING on the Internet without any restrictions.
==========
You may deactivate the traceability of your contributions to a group by Internet search engines or by so-called RSS readers in your privacy settings under "Privacy".
However, any contributions you posted on the group prior to deactivation will remain visible after the deactivation as well.
RSS readers are programs which trace updates of a website, providing the website technically supports the so called RSS standard.
Where Internet groups support the RSS standard, the RSS reader may track if, when and which new articles have been published.
6.
==========
Appointments, Activities, Event Management
On the XING Websites, XING offers you the possibility to enter your appointments, activities and events as well as similar services (collectively hereinafter referred to as "events").
With this function you may manage and coordinate your events with other XING Members and/or with non-members of XING, and you may also invite other XING Members and/or non-members to specific events.
==========
Each event has one (1) or more hosts (organizers).
The host decides for each event if and which information about the event is visible to other XING Members and/or for non-members of XING.
Among other things, this information may include whether the event is reserved to XING Members or whether it is a public event and as such accessible to non-members, whether the number of participants is limited, whether the guest list is visible without any restrictions or if and which restrictions should apply to the visibility of the guest list.
The above information shall be displayed on the XING Websites for the relevant event.
It is visible to XING Members, and it may also be visible to non-members, depending on the settings chosen by the host.
7.
==========
Invitations
As a XING Member you may invite others to join XING.
XING shall process personal data collected in the course of the invitation solely for the invitation and shall not use it for any other purposes.
Please note that the following sections of your Personal Data are displayed to the recipient of the invitation:

Your photograph
Number of your confirmed contacts
Number of hits on your Profile
Month and year of your membership
Type of your membership


8.
==========
What does "Clickpath" mean?
"Clickpath" is a function of the XING Services which registers access to XING Members’ Profiles by other XING Members or access to specific information within XING Members’ Profiles.
The information registered by Clickpath is only available to Premium Members of XING.
By using Clickpath you can see which Profiles of other XING Members you have visited.
You can also check which other XING Members have visited your Profile.
By the same token, all other Premium Members of XING can do the same, i.e. they may see whether you have visited their Profile.
==========
This feature is an essential part of contact management on XING and as such an essential feature of the XING Services: you are not able to deactivate this feature in your privacy settings.
If you do not agree that other XING Members may see that you have visited their Profile, you should not use the XING Services.
Furthermore, Clickpath registers which XING Members have visited your XING "About me" page which you can set up within the framework of XING Services, and which XING Members have visited the website of one of your previous companies.
Any information registered by Clickpath is deleted by XING automatically within one (1) week after its registration.
9.
==========
Search Functions
The XING Services offer various possibilities to search for particular XING Members, including a Powersearch feature and a Search Agent feature.
These various search functions may assist you, for example, in finding other XING Members with similar interests.
The search functions can also help you to initiate contact with other XING Members who offer exactly what you are looking for.
Thus, you can find the contacts you need - and systematically expand your personal network.
10.
==========
Newsletter, weekly Status emails
XING regularly sends out newsletters or weekly status emails (collectively hereinafter referred to as the "newsletter(s)") to all XING Members.
In these newsletters XING may inform you, among other things, about new features on XING, about your events in the upcoming week, and XING may also provide you with specific personal statistics from the respective past calendar week (i.e. the number of hits on your Profile, whether you have new contacts to be confirmed and/or new private messages, etc.).
Furthermore, XING may present three (3) new members of XING to you in each newsletter.
It may also be the case that XING presents you as a possible contact to other XING Members in a newsletter.
If you do not wish to be presented as a possible contact to other XING Members in a newsletter, you can change the settings under "Privacy" at any time so that this shall not happen.
==========
Finally, XING may inform you about three (3) random XING Members who have visited your Profile in the past week.
Of course, this may also apply to yourself vice versa, i.e. you may be one of those random XING Members with regard to another XING Member whose Profile you have visited in the past week.
You may choose to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by sending an email to the link provided at the end of each newsletter.
11.
==========
Cookies
After you have logged in to the XING Services with your username and password, XING uses cookies in order to identify you during the course of your session.
A cookie will be stored on your computer.
==========
Upon the termination of your session the cookie will be automatically deleted.
You can save this cookie on your computer to enable automatic login for subsequent sessions by activating the function: "Login automatically on this computer".
The cookie will then store part of your login data in encrypted form.
If you select automatic login, please be aware that this will then only be possible on the same computer on which the cookie was first saved, i.e. an automatic login on two (2) different computers is not possible.
12.
==========
Log Files
Each time you access a website from the XING Websites, XING will save the following data in a log file (the so called "server log"):

Your IP address (by which your computer can be clearly identified),
The name and IP address of the computer requesting the respective page from the XING Websites (the so called "remote host computer"),
The time, status, and amount of the transferred data, as well as the website from which you have reached the requested page of the XING Websites (the so-called "referrer")
The product and release information from your Internet browser (the so called "user agent").
This log file will be stored by XING in the standardized "combined" log file format for the Apache web server.
XING uses the data from this log file in anonymous form without reference to your person for statistical purposes.
In doing so, XING may analyze on which days and at which time the XING Services are particularly frequented and how much data volume is created on the XING Websites.
Furthermore, by using the log file, XING can identify defects on the XING Websites, such as defective hyperlinks or program defects, and thus continually improve the quality of the XING Websites.
XING does not attribute the website demands stored in the log file to specific individual users.
==========
However, XING reserves the right to review the log files from the last known IP address of a XING Member where XING has reasonable cause to believe that the member is using XING Services in breach of contractual agreements or the applicable legislation.
In doing this, XING is protecting other XING Members, the safety of XING Members’ data, as well as XING Websites and the XING Services.
13.
==========
Minors
Membership of XING Services is reserved for persons who have reached the legal age of 18.
Parents and legal guardians are responsible for the protection of their children's privacy.
14.
Accessibility of these Terms and Conditions on Data Protection
These Terms and Conditions on Data Protection are accessible from any website of the XING Websites under the link "Data Protection".
