The targeting of the video content of websites marketed by smartclip is operated by third parties, which also operate advertising for websites from other providers.
These third parties then create so-called user profiles by means of cookies and use their respective targeting systems to analyze the data that is collected for the purpose of selecting user-oriented advertising.

With the help of these targeting systems, it is possible for different target groups to receive the advertising that is most relevant to them.
This also benefits you because it means it is possible to minimize the distraction resulting from advertising that is irrelevant to you and to control the number of advertisements.
