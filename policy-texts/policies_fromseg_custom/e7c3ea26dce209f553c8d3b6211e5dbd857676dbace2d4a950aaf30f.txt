We strive to address all reasonable privacy and security concerns, encourage our users to act responsibly, and make Meebo a place where we can all feel safe and secure.
Below is our philosophical approach to privacy, security, and the pursuit of happiness here at Meebo.
privacy
As you review our full privacy policy, you should know it is based on a few simple principles.
We keep only what we need.
==========
We ask for personal data only when we think it's absolutely necessary to provide you the best Meebo experience possible.
We will be responsible with your data.
Our friends use Meebo.
We wouldn't have any friends if we shared their private info willy-nilly all over the internet, so we hold ourselves to a high standard.
We hate spam (and spim) and don't want you to get any more spam because of Meebo.
==========
We will be a transparent and open company.
We will communicate openly and freely with our users.
We will be quick to relay news, both good and bad.
Read our privacy policy
security
We take security seriously.
We know that security is important to our users.
After all, we use our products, too.
So here's the plan: We'll explain in detail some of the security measures we have in place so you can stay informed, and you'll be super careful with your personal data online.
