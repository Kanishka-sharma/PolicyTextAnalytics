Other Important Information
Advertising
You may see T‑Mobile and other advertisements on your devices - whether you are connected to our network or using another connection method (e.g., Wi-Fi or wireline connections).
In some cases, these ads may be targeted to your device based on information the advertiser has gathered about your online or offline behavior, or other data about your interests.
These online ads are sometimes called “interest-based” or “targeted” ads.
==========
Like most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T‑Mobile works with third-party advertising networks, which collect certain information about our customers and visitors to our websites and apps, serve ads for us and others, and measure their effectiveness.
The advertising networks that provide these ads may place cookies and web beacons or use mobile device identifiers and similar technologies on websites and apps.
This technology allows tracking of device activity over time across online properties.
The advertising networks’ use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies and those of the sites where they operate.
==========
T‑Mobile may also use its own online advertising services in connection with these ad activities.
We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
To learn more about ad targeting and our ad services please see our article on Advertising and Analytics in the T‑Mobile Privacy Center.
For more information on your choices, go to the Advertising Choices section.
==========
Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals are a web browser setting or other mechanisms used to indicate that you do not want your online activity tracked.
Because there is no universal standard of how to apply the DNT setting, we currently do not honor them.
However, we honor Do Not Sell settings as described below.
==========
Children
We believe it is important to protect the privacy and safety of children.
Generally, if you authorize a minor to use our Products or Services by providing them a device or other access associated with your account, any personal data associated with their use will be treated as your personal data under this privacy policy.
Where applicable, if you are the primary account holder, you will have the ability to set marketing and other preferences for other lines on your account, including those for any minors to whom you provide a device.
We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children (including Internet browsing and app usage).
See the Family Controls article in our Privacy Center.
==========
This privacy policy does not apply to data collected from third party apps and we encourage parents to review the terms and policies of such apps before downloading them.
Geolocation Data
If your mobile device is turned on, our network is collecting data about the device location.
We may use, provide access to, or disclose this network location data without your approval to provide and support our Services, including to route wireless communications, operate and improve our network and business, detect and prevent fraud, provide information to emergency responders about where to find you when you call public safety agencies, including through 911 or similar emergency services numbers, or as required by law.
Subject to your preference choices, we and others may also use location data to provide location-based services (LBS), or to personalize your experience and ads.
==========
To learn more, review our Cookies and Tracking Technology article and our Advertising and Analytics page.
Internet of Things
In many cases, we provide connectivity to Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices and services offered by other companies.
In such cases, we collect basic information about the information flowing over our network.
However, if you are a customer of a T‑Mobile IoT Service, we, and our application providers, also collect information from the IoT device and any related app to support the Service to which you have subscribed.
The information varies depending on the IoT Service but may include personal data like contact information and location, audio, and device activity and measurement data.
==========
Technologies in our Retail Stores
In some of our retail stores beacons have been deployed and we receive aggregate reports (none of which identify any individual or device) from these stores regarding store traffic that relies in part on information collected from such beacons through mobile applications.
We may also use technology that tracks aggregate traffic patterns and wait times in our stores using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth identifiers (e.g., a MAC address).
Where such technology is used, we will provide a prominent notice at the location.
If you wish to exclude your device from such in-store mobile analytics, you can opt out at any time by entering your MAC address at https://optout.smart-places.org.
We may use video monitoring and recording in our retail stores for security purposes as well as traffic pattern and other analytics purposes.
==========
Unaffiliated Websites and Mobile Applications
Our Products and Services may provide links to or the ability to access third-party websites, or the ability to install or use third-party mobile apps on your device not controlled by T‑Mobile or governed by this privacy policy.
These websites and mobile apps may collect personal data from or about you.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any website or mobile app that we do not control, and your interactions with such websites and mobile apps are governed solely by their respective privacy policies, not this privacy policy.
You may also choose to give personal data directly to third parties when using our Services.
==========
Except as otherwise notified, personal data you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions, and policies—not this privacy policy.
You should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.
For additional details, please review our article on Device Apps in the T‑Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Our Products and Services may also offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Products and Services with other media, and vice versa.
Your use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.
For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.
==========
US-Based Organization
T‑Mobile is headquartered in the United States and our data processing activities primarily occur in the United States.
You acknowledge that any personal data we collect may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States.
You further acknowledge that the United States has standards for the processing and storage of personal data that may not be equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen, and you consent to our collection, transfer, processing, and storage of your personal data in the United States.
==========
International Data Privacy
Sprint’s international Services are directed to business customers only.
Users of Sprint’s international Services are typically employees of those business customers, or prospective business customers, and personal data that we collect will generally be limited to information collected or generated in a business context.
Sprint’s International Data Privacy Policy describes our practices and policies regarding the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, and processing of personal data collected outside the United States in connection with Services offered by Sprint Business, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents.
