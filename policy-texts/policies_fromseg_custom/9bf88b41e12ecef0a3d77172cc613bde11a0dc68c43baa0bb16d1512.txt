This Privacy Policy explains Tesla’s policies and procedures regarding information we collect from or about our customers and their use of our products and services.
Tesla intends to provide you with a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information that we collect.
This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
By providing information to us or by using our products or services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
==========
Information We May Collect
We collect three main types of information related to you or your use of our products and services: (1) information from or about you or your devices; (2) information from or about your Tesla vehicle; and (3) information from or about your Tesla energy products.
Depending on the Tesla products and services you request, own, or use, not all of these types of information may be applicable to you.
From or about you or your devices
We may collect information from or about you (such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail, payment information, driver’s license or other government identification information) or your devices in a variety of ways, including:
Through our Digital Services: We may collect information from or about you through our websites, software applications, social media pages, e-mail messages, or other digital services (the “Digital Services”), e.g., when you sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or register your product with us.
Through credit applications and other forms: We may collect additional information from you or others on your behalf on our credit application and other forms to support our product lease or other financing offerings, such as date of birth, Social Security number, bank routing information, and credit related information.
==========
We also receive information about you from consumer reporting agencies such as credit history and capacity.
From other sources: We also may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, certified installers, third-party vehicle repair or service centers, and social media platforms.
==========
Tesla Account: Customers who purchase certain Tesla products will receive a Tesla Account, which is hosted on our website.
We may collect and process the following types of data for your Tesla Account that you elect to provide to us: your customer registration information; the status of your order; warranty and other documentation for your Tesla products; and general information about your Tesla products (including, for example, vehicle identification number or other product serial number, service plan information, or connectivity package), insurance forms, driver’s licenses, financing agreements, and similar information.
You can access your Tesla Account to update the information from or about you in that account at any time.
Offline: We may collect information from or about you offline, such as when you visit a Tesla store or repair facility, attend one of our events, sign up for a test drive, place an order over the phone, or contact our customer service or sales department.

==========
From or about your Tesla vehicle
We may collect a variety of information from or about your Tesla vehicle, including:
Telematics log data: To improve our vehicles and services for you, we may collect certain telematics data regarding the performance, usage, operation, and condition of your Tesla vehicle, including: vehicle identification number; speed information; odometer readings; battery use management information; battery charging history; electrical system functions; software version information; infotainment system data; safety-related data and camera images (including information regarding the vehicle’s SRS systems, braking and acceleration, security, e-brake, and accidents); short video clips of accidents; information regarding the use and operation of Autopilot, Summon, and other features; and other data to assist in identifying issues and analyzing the performance of the vehicle.
We may collect such information either in person (such as during a service appointment) or via remote access.
==========
Remote analysis data: We may be able to dynamically connect to your Tesla vehicle to diagnose and resolve issues with it, and this process may result in access to personal settings in the vehicle (such as contacts, browsing history, navigation history, and radio listening history).
This dynamic connection also enables us to view the current location of your vehicle, but such access is restricted to a limited number of personnel within Tesla.
==========
Other vehicle data: In order to help improve our products and services, we may collect and store other vehicle data, including: data about accidents involving your Tesla vehicle (e.g., air bag deployment and other recent sensor data); data about remote services (e.g., remote lock/unlock, start/stop charge, and honk-the-horn commands); a data report to confirm that your vehicle is online together with information about the current software version and certain telematics data; vehicle connectivity information; data about any issues that could materially impair operation of your vehicle; data about any safety-critical issues; and data about each software and firmware update.
We may collect such information either in person (such as during a service appointment) or via remote access.
Service history: In order to facilitate the servicing of your car, we may collect and process data about the service history of each Tesla vehicle, such as the customer’s name, vehicle identification number, repair history, any outstanding recalls, any bills due, any customer complaints, and any other information related to its service history.
Charging station information: We may collect information regarding the charge rate and charging stations used by you (including outlets) in order to, e.g., analyze which charging stations are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges are, and where additional charging stations are needed.
==========
Advanced features:
We may provide you with features in your Tesla vehicle, such as real-time traffic, Autopilot, and Summon, which make use of the road segment data of your vehicle and we may share this data with partners that contribute similar data to help us provide the service, but we only collect or share the data in a way that does not identify you or your car.
We also may collect similar data in connection with other features, such as the navigation data for the online routing feature, and may share it with business partners where necessary to provide the feature to you, but, again, we only collect or share the data in a way that does not identify you or your car.
We also only collect or share this data if you enable this collection, although if you do so, your vehicle may send this data to Tesla and its partners even if you are not actively using a feature that needs this information.
You can enable or disable the collection and sharing of this data at any time via the “DATA SHARING” setting in Controls > Settings > Safety & Security.
==========
To further help develop and improve autonomous safety features, we may collect short video clips using the car’s external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs, and traffic light positions.
These short video clips are not linked to your vehicle identification number and we have ensured that there is no way to search our system for clips that are associated with a specific car.
==========
You can enable or disable the collection of these clips any time via the “DATA SHARING” setting in Controls > Settings > Safety & Security.
If you no longer wish us to collect telematics log data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
Please note that if you opt out from the collection of telematics log data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle (with the exception of the Data Sharing setting detailed above), we will not be able to notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle in real time.
==========
This may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability, and it may also disable many features of your vehicle including periodic software and firmware updates, remote services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser functionality.
From or about your Tesla energy products
We may collect a variety of information from or about your Tesla energy products or your home from you, via a certified installer when one of our energy advisers visits your home, from your electric utility, or from the installed products (directly or via paired equipment, such as an inverter), including:
We may collect information about your product, such as your installation date, number of products installed, and serial number(s).
We may collect information about your home, such as the dimensions of your roof, the configuration of your electric system, and the capacity of any existing solar system.
==========
In order to provide and improve our energy products and services, we may collect data regarding where your product is installed and how it is configured, data related to the product’s use and performance, data regarding your home energy consumption, and other data relevant to diagnose issues.
If you no longer wish us to collect performance data or any other data from your Tesla energy product, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
Please note that if you opt out from the collection of performance data from your Tesla energy product, we will not be able to notify you of issues applicable to your energy product in real time.
This may result in your energy product suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability, and it may also disable many features of your energy product including periodic software and firmware updates.

Patent Pledge
On June 12, 2014, Tesla announced that it will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use its technology.
Tesla was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and this policy is intended to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting Tesla, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world.
These guidelines provide further detail as to how we are implementing this policy.
==========
Tesla’s Pledge
Tesla irrevocably pledges that it will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Tesla Patent through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith.
Key terms of the Pledge are explained below.
Definition of Key Terms
"Tesla Patents" means all patents owned now or in the future by Tesla (other than a patent owned jointly with a third party or any patent that Tesla later acquires that comes with an encumbrance that prevents it from being subject to this Pledge).
A list of Tesla Patents subject to the Pledge will be maintained at the following URL: https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-list.
==========
A party is "acting in good faith" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:
asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;
challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or
marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.
Transfer of Tesla Patents
Should Tesla ever transfer a Tesla Patent to a third party, it will do so only to a party that agrees, by means of a public declaration intended to be binding on such party, to provide the same protection that Tesla provided under the Pledge and to place the same requirement on any subsequent transferee.
Legal Effect
The Pledge, which is irrevocable and legally binding on Tesla and its successors, is a "standstill," meaning that it is a forbearance of enforcement of Tesla’s remedies against any party for claims of infringement for so long as such party is acting in good faith.
In order for Tesla to preserve its ability to enforce the Tesla Patents against any party not acting in good faith, the Pledge is not a waiver of any patent claims (including claims for damages for past acts of infringement) and is not a license, covenant not to sue, or authorization to engage in patented activities or a limitation on remedies, damages or claims.
==========
Except as expressly stated in the Pledge, no rights shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.
Finally, the Pledge is not an indication of the value of an arms-length, negotiated license or a reasonable royalty.
==========
What this pledge means is that as long as someone uses our patents for electric vehicles and doesn’t do bad things, such as knocking off our products or using our patents and then suing us for intellectual property infringement, they should have no fear of Tesla asserting its patents against them.

Payment Terms for Services
These Terms of Service describe your agreement to pay for future services and charges.
==========
Tesla may amend these terms and any changes are effective when posted to this page.
The services or charges described below may result in charges to you, even if someone else is using your vehicle.
==========
Tesla may collect payment from you, including by using the credit card saved in your Tesla Account.
Charges may include taxes as required by law.
You will be able to review a summary of transactions in your Tesla Account.
==========
If we are unable to collect payment, we may contact you based on your information on file, or may request payment when we are performing services for you.
If you do not pay past due amounts we may limit or block your vehicle's ability to use the related services until payment issues are resolved.
For information on how we handle your credit card information, please see our Privacy Policy.
==========
Idle Fee
In consideration of others who need to use a Supercharger, we ask that you move your vehicle when it is finished charging.
To encourage this, you will incur an idle fee for the time your car remains parked in a charging stall after it is finished charging.
We will waive the idle fee if your car is moved within five minutes after it is finished charging, and the idle fee will not accumulate while less than half of the charging stalls at your location are occupied.
==========
All vehicles are subject to idle fees, regardless of when your vehicle was purchased.
To avoid idle fees, we recommend you monitor your vehicle while using a Supercharger and encourage you to use the Tesla mobile app to track your vehicle's charge status.
Idle fees are incurred on a per minute basis.
==========
The idle fee rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicle touchscreen).
By remaining parked in a charging stall after your vehicle is finished charging, you accept the idle fee rate communicated to you through the map pin pop-up.
For additional information, please see our idle fee support page and address other inquiries to ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com.
==========
Pay Per Use
All vehicles ordered after January 15, 2017, and vehicles ordered by January 15, 2017 but built after April 15, 2017, are enabled for Supercharging on a pay per use basis.
Any credits for free Supercharging that are given with the purchase of a vehicle, including any annual renewal of credits, expire upon the sale or transfer of the vehicle and are not transferable to any subsequent vehicle owner, or to any other vehicle.
Credits for Supercharging expire after a set period of time and do not rollover into future periods.
==========
Pay per use billing is on a per kilowatt hour basis in jurisdictions where this is feasible, and as a service fee on a per minute basis in other jurisdictions.
The pay per use billing unit and rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicle touchscreen).
By charging your vehicle in a particular location, you accept the price of charging communicated to you through the map pin pop-up.
==========
For additional information, please see our Supercharger support page and address other inquiries to ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com.
Supercharger Fair Use Policy
Introduction
We are continually expanding our global network of Supercharger stations to enable personal long distance travel and to provide a charging solution for those without immediate access to home or workplace charging, thereby accelerating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.
When Superchargers are used beyond their intended purpose, it negatively impacts the availability of Supercharging services for others.
Supercharger Fair Use
To help ensure that Superchargers are available for their intended use, we ask that you not charge your vehicle using a Supercharger if your vehicle is being used:
as a taxi;
for ridesourcing or ridesharing (through Uber, Lyft or similar services);
to commercially deliver or transport goods;
for government purposes; or
for any other commercial venture.
If you charge your vehicle in a manner that does not comply with this Supercharger Fair Use Policy, we may ask you to modify this behavior.
We may also take additional action to protect the availability of Superchargers for their intended purpose, such as limiting or blocking your vehicle’s ability to use Supercharger stations.
This Policy applies to all Superchargers worldwide and all Tesla vehicles purchased, either new or used, whether from Tesla or a third party, after December 15, 2017.
Tesla may choose to exclude certain Supercharger stations or occasional trips from the scope of this Policy, such as to accommodate specific local circumstances.
==========
Charging Alternatives
We encourage the commercial use of Tesla vehicles while using appropriate charging solutions.
Please reach out to your local sales contact to explore vehicle and charging options that suit your needs.
For questions related to home charging, please contact charginginstallation@tesla.com.

If not resolved within 60 days, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Tesla will not be decided by a judge or jury but instead by a single arbitrator in an arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.

The arbitrator cannot hear class or representative claims or requests for relief on behalf of others purchasing or leasing Tesla products.

If a court or arbitrator decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate cannot be enforced as to a particular claim for relief or remedy (such as injunctive or declaratory relief), then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) shall be severed and must be brought in court and any other claims must be arbitrated.
If you prefer, you may instead take an individual dispute to small claims court.
==========
You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days after signing this Agreement by sending a letter to: Tesla, Inc.; P.O. Box 15430; Fremont, CA 94539-7970, stating your name, product, and intent to opt out of the arbitration provision.
If you do not opt out, this agreement to arbitrate overrides any different arbitration agreement between us, including any arbitration agreement in a lease or finance contract.

Entire Agreement
These Terms & Conditions is the entire agreement between you and us.
==========
It supersedes all other agreements, communications or representations, oral or written, between us, past or present.
We are not responsible for any statements, agreements, representations, warranties or covenants, oral or written, including, without limitation, any statements from third parties, concerning or relating to the Service provided to you pursuant to these Terms & Conditions, unless such statements, agreements, representations warranties or covenants are expressly contained in or incorporate by these Terms & Conditions.
==========
Survivorship

Waiver; Severability
No waiver of any part of these Terms & Conditions, or of any breach of it, in any one instance will require us to waive any other instance or breach.
If any part of these Terms & Conditions is declared invalid or unenforceable, all other parts of these Terms & Conditions are still valid and enforceable.
Assignment
We can assign these Terms & Conditions, in whole or in part, to any individual or entity we choose, at any time, without notice to you, in our sole discretion.
==========
Unsupported or Salvaged Vehicle Policy
An unsupported or salvaged vehicle is a vehicle that has been declared a total loss, commonly after extensive damage caused by a crash, flooding, fire, or similar hazard, and has been (or qualifies to be) registered and/or titled by its owner as a salvaged vehicle or its equivalent pursuant to local jurisdiction or industry practice.
Salvage registration/titling typically can never be removed from the vehicle so that all future persons understand the condition and value of the vehicle.
Tesla does not warrant the safety or operability of salvaged vehicles.
==========
Repairs performed to bring a salvaged vehicle back into service may not meet Tesla standards or specifications and that is why the vehicle is unsupported.
Consequently, any failures, damages, or injuries occurring as a result of such repairs or continued operation of an unsupported vehicle are solely the responsibility of the vehicle owner.
Until Tesla can confirm that the vehicle is in compliance with Tesla’s safety standards and vehicle specifications, Tesla does not perform or support repairs involving the HV (high-voltage) battery systems in the vehicle because of the potential for the salvage vehicle to have sustained damage that:
Makes the vehicle unsafe to drive
Makes the vehicle unsafe for any repair technicians that might work on the vehicle
Might damage Tesla equipment, such as Superchargers
When a vehicle is classified as a salvaged vehicle:
Any Tesla limited warranties and extended service agreements for the vehicle are void.
NOTE: Repairs due to recalls will be performed unless the safe repair of the vehicle is prevented either by the condition of the vehicle or by vehicle modifications not installed by Tesla.
If the Tesla Service Center determines that the vehicle is not safe to repair, the recall-related repair will not be performed until the customer has returned the vehicle to a condition that the Service Center determines is safe to repair.
==========
Supercharging is permanently disabled.
Parts availability is not affected.
==========
Any Unrestricted or Over-the-Counter part may be purchased for a salvage-titled vehicle.
A “Salvage-Titled Vehicle HV Safety Inspection” may be performed (at the customer’s expense) on the vehicle to determine if the HV-related components are safe to work on or access.

Tesla’s Supplier Code of Conduct
Download PDF
Last Updated June 2017
Human Rights And Conflict Minerals Policy
Tesla expects our suppliers to conduct their worldwide operations in responsible manner in adherence of this policy and the principles enumerated herein.
Tesla works collaboratively with our suppliers to encourage compliance with the following principles:
Legal And Regulatory Compliance
Tesla suppliers are to ensure their operations and the products and services supplied to Tesla comply with all national and other applicable laws and regulations.
Conflict Minerals
Tesla's suppliers are expected to use reasonable efforts to ensure that parts and products supplied to Tesla are DRC "conflict-free," meaning that such conflict minerals do not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
==========
Conflict-free means such parts and supplies do not contain metals derived from "conflict minerals" which are defined as:
(i) columbite-tantalite (tantalum);
(ii) cassiterite (tin);
(iii) gold;
(iv) wolframite (tungsten); and
(v) any derivatives of the above.
The goal of this policy is to ensure that Tesla's products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups through mining or mineral trading in the DRC and adjoining countries.
==========
Tesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems, consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, that are designed to accomplish this goal.
Tesla expects its suppliers to stay up-to-date with and to use validated conflict free smelters and refiners assessed by the Responsible Mineral Initiative and similar organizations.
Tesla performs ongoing due diligence and files annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
==========
Human Rights
Tesla is committed to ensuring that its suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking.
Tesla does not, and will not, tolerate the use of slave or child labor in the manufacture of its products and does not, and will not, accept products or services from suppliers that engage in human trafficking in any form.
Human trafficking, child labor and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law.
==========
These crimes exist in countries throughout the world.
Supplier Compliance
Tesla will do the following to ensure compliance by its suppliers with this policy as required by law and as needed:
Evaluate its supply chain to address risks related to conflict minerals, human trafficking, slavery and child labor;
Audit suppliers, to evaluate supplier compliance with Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;
Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Tesla products comply with the laws regarding conflict minerals, slavery, child labor and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business;
Discipline employees or contractors, including potential termination of contract, who fail to meet Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;
Train certain Tesla employees regarding conflict minerals, human trafficking, child labor and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the Tesla's supply chain;
Investigate if Tesla has a reasonable basis to believe that a Tesla supplier is engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals; and
Transition away from purchasing goods or services from any supplier that is believed to be engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals if the supplier does not take corrective actions within a reasonable period of time.
==========
Grievance Mechanism
You may contact Tesla's Board of Directors to provide comments or to report concerns.
Please write to:
Corporate Secretary
Tesla
3500 Deer Creek Rd.
Palo Alto, CA 94304
You may submit your concern anonymously or confidentially by postal mail.
