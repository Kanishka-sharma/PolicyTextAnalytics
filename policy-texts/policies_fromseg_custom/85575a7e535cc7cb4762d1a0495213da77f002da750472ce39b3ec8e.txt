==========
When do we disclose personal information and to what types of entities do we disclose personal information?
We may disclose personal information we collect, such as the categories described above, to make our financial products and services, as well as those offered by our service providers, available to you.
We may also use and disclose personal information as authorized by you.
If you decide to withhold certain information, it may limit our ability to provide you with the services or products you requested.
We do not disclose personal information about former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities.
We may disclose your personal information to the following entities: 


our affiliated companies (please see below to learn how you may limit the sharing of some of this information for marketing purposes by our affiliated companies);
other financial companies to jointly market to our loan portfolio customers in order to provide them with loan refinance options (California residents, please see below to learn how you may limit the sharing of this information);
non-affiliated third parties that perform services, such as marketing or market research, on our behalf (e.g., we may provide your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address to vendors that send our e-mail or regular mail);
companies that service, maintain, or process your transactions and accounts (e.g., companies that provide administrative, telecommunications, computer, trade execution, payment or securities clearing, prepare and mail account statements and transaction confirmations and other services in connection with the operation of our business);
non-affiliated third parties as permitted or required by law, or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities (e.g., government and regulatory organizations, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the UK Financial Services Authority and Information Commissioner's Office (and other international data protection authorities), as well as self-regulatory organizations of which we are a member, such as FINRA, and states we are registered with and to parties under court order or subpoena that request this information);
non-affiliated third parties at your direction or for which you have provided your express consent (e.g., any banking or financial institution with which you have or propose to have dealings); and
third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, insuring, sale, securitization, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets (including accounts) for the purposes of evaluating and performing the proposed transaction.
We require that commercial entities (as described above) with which we share your personal information agree to keep your information confidential.
We also prohibit those entities from using or disclosing your information except for a limited purpose and to the persons for whom disclosure was intended, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.
==========
Service providers to whom we disclose personal information must agree to contractual requirements consistent with our privacy and security policies.
We prohibit our service providers from using personal information except for the specific purpose for which we provide it to them, and require them to comply with legal obligations applicable to the personal information at issue.
We will not disclose information about your external financial accounts to non-affiliated entities, but we may disclose this information to our corporate affiliates to provide you with account aggregation services and for marketing purposes unless you opt-out of such sharing.
==========
How may you limit the sharing of your information?
The law allows you to limit or "opt-out" of our sharing personal information about you in certain circumstances with non-affiliated third party companies; that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures.
However, we do not currently share information about you with any non-affiliated third party that triggers this opt-out right.
Accordingly, there is no need at this time for you to opt-out or take any other affirmative action telling us not to share such information with non-affiliated third parties.
The law also allows you to opt-out of our sharing certain personal information about you (e.g., information other than your transactions and experiences with us such as your credit report) among our affiliated companies; that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures.
However, we only share your transactions and experiences information (e.g., account balance, trading activity, loan amount, and account history) with our affiliated companies.
Therefore, there is no need for you to exercise your opt-out right.
==========
Finally, the law also gives you the right to limit some kinds of marketing from our affiliated companies.
You may elect not to have our affiliated companies market their products or services to you where such marketing is based on information about you that we share with them.
Since our affiliated companies engage in such marketing from time to time, we are providing you with the ability to opt-out so that you do not receive these marketing communications in the future.To limit these marketing offers, please contact us by using the email or telephone contact information provided below.
Your choice to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies will apply until you tell us otherwise.
You may change your opt-out status at any time.
For consumers with joint accounts, an opt-out direction by one joint account holder will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint account holders.
==========
Where do we store personal information?
Generally, the personal information that we collect from you will be stored in the United States and other countries, which may have different privacy laws and standards than those in your country of residence.
Your personal information may be transferred to or processed in the United States by us or a third party service provider working for us, or for one of our affiliates or suppliers.
By submitting personal information via our website or other means, you agree to such storage, transfers and processing.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to treat your personal information securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
==========
It is important to note that some or all of your personal information provided to third party service providers may be held in countries other than your own, including in particular the United States.
You acknowledge and understand that your personal information will be subject to the applicable laws of each such jurisdiction, which may not provide for the same protection as your country of residence.
For example, government entities in the United States and other countries may have certain legislative rights to access your personal information.
If you have questions about our policies and practices with respect to service providers outside your jurisdiction, including the collection, use, disclosure or storage of such personal information by our service providers worldwide, you may contact our Chief Privacy Officer by e-mail at CPO@etrade.com.
==========
