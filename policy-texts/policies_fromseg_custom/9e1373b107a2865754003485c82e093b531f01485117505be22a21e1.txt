ShopAtHome.com's Privacy Policy is divided into two sections, Cash Back and Catalogs, so it can clearly address the issues relevant to each major component of our ShopAtHome.com Shopping Portal
Cash Back Privacy Policy
We at ShopAtHome.com take your right to privacy seriously.
We developed this Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our Membership Agreement, to ensure that:
You fully understand your rights as a ShopAtHome.com member and Toolbar user
You recognize ShopAtHome.com's responsibilities to you, and
You recognize our commitment to upholding your privacy.

What Information We Collect and Why
At ShopAtHome.com we aim to provide our members with the most current shopping information, keep them informed of the best deals on relevant products, and maximize their "Cash Back" rewards.
The primary way we accomplish these goals is by utilizing the power of our consumer membership base to gain access to special deals and promotions, and to negotiate sales commissions from both well-known national retailers as well as specialty boutiques (our "Affiliate Stores").
==========
We then share this commission with you, as a ShopAtHome.com member, in the form of real cash.
Consequently, when you first register with ShopAtHome.com, we ask you to provide your name, email address and password so we can notify you of your Cash Back rewards.
ShopAtHome.com may also collect certain information online deriving from your navigation of ShopAtHome.com and our Affiliate Stores.
We collect this information to ensure that you receive your cash back rewards and to better understand what type of stores and specials to pursue.
==========
When you make a credit card purchase on one of our Affiliate Stores, our system is notified that a credit card transaction has taken place.
This notification occurs to help ensure that your Cash Back rewards are properly credited to your account.
No individual credit card information is received by our Site.
==========
Members who have elected to download our Toolbar also receive shopping alerts based on their browser activity.
These alerts can be for special deals and/or stores that are pertinent to our members' shopping needs.
A history of links to our Stores may be kept in order to better personalize our members' shopping alerts.
==========
ShopAtHome.com uses cookie technology to understand general information on site traffic trends such as most frequently visited pages or Affiliate Stores.
This information is captured on an aggregate basis, is not specific to individual users, and enables us to continually improve our Web site content and navigation.
We also use cookie technology for login and navigation between the various components of our Site.
==========
We sometimes make available to users on our Site specific offers from third party companies.
Please note that any personal information that you provide on our Site to take advantage of such third party offers may also be retained by ShopAtHome.
This web site contains links to other sites.
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites.
We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

How We Ensure the Security of Your Information
ShopAtHome.com has security measures in place to protect the information within our control from loss, misuse or alteration.
We have appropriate industry standard procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.
However, no data transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure.
Consequently, while ShopAtHome.com makes every effort to protect your personal information, any information that you provide to ShopAtHome.com or its Affiliate Stores is transmitted at your own risk.
With Whom We Share Your Information
Our primary use of your personal information is to process your Cash Back reward checks and to maintain your Member account.
==========
Your browser activity is used to trigger personalized shopping alerts if you have elected to use our shopping Toolbar.
ShopAtHome.com may also store and use your personal information for our own internal mailing and database purposes.
The composite tracking information generated by cookies, as outlined above, may be shared with third parties for the purpose of documenting site activity and other trends.
In the course of our day-to-day business, we may employ outside companies and individuals to perform functions for us, such as removing duplicate information from customer lists or providing database analysis.
These vendors have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
==========
All emails distributed by Belcaro Group, Inc. d/b/a ShopAtHome, or ShopAtHome.com have simple opt-out mechanisms should you decide you do not want to receive these offers from us.
Your privacy as related to our Affiliate Stores

With these two pieces of information, we are able to make sure the right rebate goes to the right person.
