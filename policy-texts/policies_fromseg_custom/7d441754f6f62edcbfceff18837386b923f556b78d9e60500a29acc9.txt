Privacy Commitment

                Protecting privacy is important to us.
This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, and share the
                information that we collect about individuals who visit the websites, mobile apps, and other digital media
                properties (collectively “Digital Properties”) of our Marketing Partners (defined below), as well as the
                options
                available to such individuals.
In certain parts of this Privacy Notice, we refer to such individuals as “you”.
==========
We’ll
                try to make this all as clear and as simple as possible, but if you have questions, you can contact us
                privacy@zypmedia.com, and we’ll be happy to help.
What We Do

                ZypMedia provides a platform for advertisers to find inventory that suits their needs and reach individuals who
                may be interested in their products or services.
For companies, we help get advertisements in front of
                individuals who are most likely to find the advertisements interesting.
For individuals, we try to place
                advertisements that are the most relevant and useful to them.
In order to do this, we collect and analyze information about individual interests.
==========
Our main source of
                information is from our Cookies and Tags (more on that below) on our Marketing Partners’ Digital Properties.
In
                some cases, our advertising customers may also provide us with Platform Data that they have independently
                collected.
With this information, we try to understand the types of products or services that users individuals
                might find interesting so we can select the most relevant advertisements to be displayed to them and perform the
                Advertising Services described below.
==========
Scope of this Privacy Policy

                This Privacy Notice covers the information that we collect or receive, through our Advertising Services (defined
                below).
It does not address any information collected from or submitted to the ZypMedia website.
Some Helpful Terminology

                We use some words and phrases in this Privacy Notice that are unique to our business and/or unique to the online
                advertising industry.
Here are some of the key terms that you’ll need to know to make it easier to review this
                Privacy Notice.
==========
Marketing Partners refers to the Digital Property operators and developers that allow us to
                    collect
                    information about the individuals who use their Digital Properties.
All of our Marketing Partners have
                    installed ZypMedia Cookies and ZypMedia Tags (defined below) on their Digital Properties which allow us to
                    collect the information to provide the Advertising Services they have requested.
Advertising Services refers broadly to the entire set of services that we provide for our
                    advertising
                    customers (the companies that pay us to understand individual interests and place their advertisements), and
                    Marketing Partners, such as the collection of information about individuals who visit the Digital Properties
                    of our Marketing Partners, the analysis of that information, the provision of that information back to our
                    Marketing Partners, and the selection and placement of optimal advertisements based on that information.
Our
                    Advertising Services fall under the umbrella of what is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising”
                    or “online behavioral advertising.”
You can learn more about interest-based advertising at the following
                    links:
                    http://www.aboutads.info/consumers;
                    http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising;
                    and
                    http://www.youronlinechoices.com.
==========
Cookies Cookies are small files containing a string of characters that are sent to your
                    computer when you
                    visit a website.
When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser
                    and the website that places the cookie has permission to read its contents each time you visit the website.
Cookies may store user preferences and other information.
You may be able to adjust your browser to refuse
                    all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set.
However, some website features or services may not
                    function properly without cookies.
ZypMedia Cookies can be identified by their URLs: zypmedia.com or
                    extend.tv.
==========
Tags (aka pixel tag or becon) is a piece of code embedded on a Digital Property that
                    collects information
                    about individual’s engagement on that Digital Property.
The use of a Tag allows us to record, for example,
                    that an individual has visited a particular page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
When a user views
                    a Digital Property with a ZypMedia Tag, our servers (located at zypmedia.com or extend.tv) are notified, and
                    we are able to collect information about what the user does on the Digital Property.
==========
Platform Data refers to information about individuals that might serve to identify their or
                    their
                    household’s computer device (e.g., a phone, tablet, or connected TV), and/or browser.
For example, we
                    consider the following types of information to be Platform Data: Internet protocol (IP) address, device or
                    browser settings, Cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers
                    (“MDI”), OTT Identifiers for Advertising (“IFA”), details about your browser, operating system or device,
                    geo-location information, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after you use
                    Digital Properties, information about the links you click, and other information about how you use the
                    Digital Properties.
Note that we may use pseudonymous identifiers, such as a randomly generated Cookie
                    identifier, to consolidate information that we’ve collected about you across different Cookies in a practice
                    that is commonly referred to as “cookie syncing.”
Information we collect may be associated with other
                    identifiers and devices in a practice known as “cross-device tracking.”
==========
Depending on where you live, some
                    Platform Data may be considered “personal data” or “personal information.”
Information Collection and Use

                Our Marketing Partners have ZypMedia Tags installed on their Digital Properties and ZypMedia Cookies that launch
                upon viewing of their websites.
When you visit one of our Marketing Partner’s Digital Properties, the Marketing
                Partner permits us to collect certain information about what you do on that Digital Property, such as, IP
                address, the pages you visited, products you viewed, browser information and other Platform Data.
In addition,
                our Marketing Partners and advertising customers may provide us with Platform Data that they have independently
                collected.
We use this information according to their instructions, which may include determining what
                advertisements might be interesting to you and if we should serve you an advertisement.
==========
We may also engage in
                frequency capping of ads (which stops you from seeing the same ad too many times); performance analytics; fraud
                detection; developing new products and services; administrative and support services; ad reporting and
                conversions; and location based advertising where permitted by law.
Information Sharing
Information Shared With Our Service Providers

                We may work with third party service providers to provide and improve the Advertising Services and our software.
These service providers may only use this information as we instruct them.
==========
Information Shared with Marketing Partners and Advertising Customers

                The Platform Data that we receive from our Marketing Partners’ Digital Properties may be shared back with the
                Marketing Partner that permitted us to collect the Platform Data.
Thus, if one of our Marketing Partners allows
                us to collect information about individuals who use or visit its Digital Property, that Marketing Partner may
                also ask us to send that information back to them for their own purposes.
In some cases, we may also share some
                Platform Data with our advertising customers, attribution and analytics partners, and other related parties to
                provide the Advertising Services.
Information Shared in Aggregated or De-Identified Form

                We may use Platform Data to create de-identified and aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic
                information, de-identified location information, de-identified information about the computer or device from
                which you access Digital Properties, or other de-identified analyses we may create.
De-identified or aggregated
                information is not personal data, and we may use such information in a number of ways, including to provide the
                Advertising Services, research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purposes.
De-identified or aggregated data may be shared with our advertising customers, business partners, Marketing
                Partners, and other third parties.
==========
Information Shared in a Change of Ownership

                If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership,
                purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then the information we have collected
                may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

                It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal system, whether by
                individuals, entities, or governments, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law.
However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties
                where appropriate.
Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose information about you to government or law
                enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or
                comply with any applicable law, regulation, or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including
                subpoenas, warrants, or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights, and safety and the rights, property
                and safety of third parties, or the public in general; and (iii) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be
                illegal or unethical.
==========
Your Choices

Website: If you are browsing the web and prefer not to receive relevant advertising from our
                advertising
                customers, you can request to opt out from our services (click here to see details).
We will then place a cookie
                on your browser that identifies you as having opted out.
Remember that opting out is browser-specific.
So, if
                you
                have multiple browsers or multiple devices you use to access the internet, you’ll need to opt out from each
                device
                or browser.
==========
Mobile Applications and other Digital Properties: If you are using a mobile application or
                other Digital Property
                and would prefer not to receive relevant advertising from our advertising customers, you can limit ad tracking
                by
                adjusting the settings as each application and/or device may permit.
In addition, users of “smart” or
                “connected”
                TVs may opt out of some OTT advertising by visiting optout.tv and following the opt out instructions.
To
                separately make choices for some mobile applications on a mobile device, you can download DAA's AppChoices
                application from your device's app store.
Please note that in most cases you must separately opt out on each
                device.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from
                some data partners and advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs.
You can access these
                and
                also learn more about interest-based advertising, consumer choice, and privacy at
                www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp,

Our Legal Bases for Processing

Legitimate Interest.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and ZypMedia
                is a controller
                of your personal data, our legal basis for processing your personal data depends on the data concerned and the
                specific context in which we collect or use it.
Normally, we rely on our and our Marketing Partners’ legitimate
                interests, except where these interests are overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms.
These legitimate
                interests may include:
              


Providing and operating ZypMedia and the Advertising Services;


Compiling statistics about the advertising transactions occurring through our Advertising Services;


Conducting research and development for our own internal business purposes;


Analyzing and reporting on campaign and ad performance;


Investigating, protecting against and deterring malicious activity, fake traffic or fraudulent,
                    unauthorized or illegal activity.
==========
Consent.
In some cases, we may rely on your consent which Marketing Partners obtain from you
                when you visit their
                Digital Properties.
If our processing of your EEA personal data is based on your consent, you may withdraw your
                consent at any time.
==========
Legal Obligation.
In limited scenarios, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
                data from you.
If you have any additional questions about our legal bases for processing EEA personal data, please contact us
                as set forth below.
==========
Individual Rights

                In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to: (i) request confirmation of whether we are
                processing your Platform Data; (ii) obtain access to or a copy of your Platform Data; (iii) receive an
                electronic copy of Platform Data that you have provided to us, or ask us to send that information to another
                company; (iv) restrict our uses of your Platform Data; (v) seek correction or amendment of inaccurate, untrue,
                incomplete, or improperly processed Platform Data; and (vi) request erasure of Platform Data held about you by
                ZypMedia, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights,
                please contact us as set forth below.
We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.
To protect your privacy, ZypMedia will take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
Please
                note that because Platform Data, by itself, cannot be used to identify an individual in the real world, we may
                not be able to authenticate your identity.
==========
Data Retention

                Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly target or collect any information
                from children under 13.
Nor do we collect information from websites or mobile apps that are directed to children
                under 13.
If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we delete that information as soon as
                possible.
==========
The Security of Your Information

                ZypMedia takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy
                Notice.
Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the
                security of any Platform Data.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for
                unintentional disclosure.
Where We Keep Your Information

                Platform Data may be transferred, processed and stored outside of your state or country (including in the United
                States), where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those where you live.
==========
Third Parties We Work With

                This Privacy Notice does not cover the privacy practices of the advertising customers, Digital Properties, and
                Marketing Partners we work with.
The advertising customers, Digital Properties, and Marketing Partners have
                their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage you to read those terms and policies.
Our Policy Toward Children

                Our Advertising Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other ages as required by local law), and we
                do not knowingly target or collect any information from children.
Nor do we collect information from Digital
                Properties that are directed to children.
If we learn that we have collected Platform Data from a child, we will
                delete that information as soon as possible.
==========
Supervisory Authority

                If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
                authority if you believe our processing of your EEA personal data violates applicable law.
Changes to the Privacy Notice

                We may revise this Privacy Notice from time to time.
If we make any material changes to this Privacy Notice that
                effect personal data previously collected about you, we’ll post the changes on our website.
