5.
==========
DATA RETENTION

Falk eSolutions AG currently retains information in the chronological "log file" of the advertisements we serve and events that we process on behalf of clients for accounting and data backup.
However, those log files are not in an easily searchable format.
==========
Falk eSolutions AG purges these log files on at least a year schedule.
Marketing score information "decays" or falls out of the database on average basis of 45 days.
That means that if you have not visited any sites in the Falk eSolutions AG group of sites that are sharing information for the creation of a marketing score in the past 45 days, your cookie will likely not have any scores associated with it, and your browser will see advertisements based on other information.
a) Internet Ads


Advertising Services


Falk eSolutions AG provides advertising services to companies that have websites and to companies that wish to advertise on the web.
Advertising Technology


Falk eSolutions AG also provides technology solutions that allow websites to serve ads and advertisers to deliver advertising and to analyze the success of their advertising campaigns online.
These services are founded on Falk eSolutions AG's in-house technology, called the AdSolution technology.
The AdSolution technology is the primary engine of advertising delivery for Falk eSolutions AG's client websites and advertisers.
What information is used when ads are served on to websites?
==========
In the normal course of providing these products and services, Falk eSolutions AG does not use personally identifiable-information about you.
Falk eSolutions AG does, however, place an adserving cookie on your computer to allow your browser to be recognized as unique but anonymous.
Please refer to the section on cookies for further information on the purpose of the Falk eSolutions AG adserving cookie and how you can opt-out of having anonymous information associated with the Falk eSolutions AG adserving cookie.
Using the information collected by the Falk eSolutions AG adserving cookie, Falk eSolutions AG, the advertiser and/or the website may be provided with information identifying your service provider, the region from which you're logging in, your IP address, and the websites on which your browser has encountered an advertisement or a clear GIF file.
b) Marketing Scores


Some of Falk eSolutions AG's website clients share non-personally-identifiable information about their visitors with us for the creation of a marketing score if the website has provided an explanation of this activity in the site's privacy policy.
Information about what ads your browser has seen and what sites your browser has visited may be used to decide which ads you receive in the future.
This information may also be used to provide website owners and advertisers with aggregate reports relating to the effectiveness of their ads and usage of their website.
==========
Falk eSolutions AG provides targeted online advertising through its "Intelligent Targeting".
These products use a Falk eSolutions AG adserving cookie to uniquely and anonymously identify your computer's browser.
==========
This allows a company to show your browser ads that relate to their products, in response to a visit your cookie makes to that company's website.
Intelligent Targeting categorizes the types of websites your browser visits, in order to provide your browser with advertising that most closely reflects your apparent interests.
==========
Intelligent Targeting allows advertisers to send ads to consumers who have indicated a specific interest area, either through recent or frequent visits to particular types of websites.
This allows a website to target visitors to that site by advertising to those anonymous visitors when they visit other Falk eSolutions AG client sites.
Falk eSolutions AG does not develop marketing scores that indicate a user's individual detailed financial, health condition, information, sexual orientation or behavior, information that appears to relate to children under 14, or information that specifies racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical opinions or beliefs, even though that information is linked only to a cookie and not to personal information such as a name or address.
6.
==========
POLICY CHANGES

As Falk eSolutions AG introduces and acquires new products and changes are made to existing products, Falk eSolutions AG reserves the right to amend this policy at any time.
Information collected about you by us under a particular policy is used in the manner disclosed to you at the time it was collected, unless Falk eSolutions AG obtains your consent to use your information in a different way.
7.
==========
SENSITIVE DATA

Falk eSolutions AG acts as an agent or processor for a wide variety of companies that may have sensitive information.
For example, a user might visit a credit institute information website and may click on an ad we have placed on that site.
Thus our log files may reflect the activities of a computer browser on sites that could be deemed sensitive, but Falk eSolutions AG does not use such information in a Marketing Score to deliver ads to you when you are on other websites.
8.
==========
CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE

If all or part of the company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the information, whether personally-identifiable or otherwise, associated with the services provided by that part of the company may be transferred as part of that transaction.
However, Falk eSolutions AG will take steps to assure that the information is used in a manner consistent with the Falk eSolutions AG privacy policy under which it was collected.
9.
==========
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

Falk eSolutions AG may transfer information to a company that provides services that assist Falk eSolutions AG in its business.
Those companies act as our agents and are bound to use the information only for the purposes for which Falk eSolutions AG has shared the information.
However, please note that information is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders.
