Our technology solutions ("Technology") include programmatic advertising platforms that empower our clients with both self-serve and managed service capabilities, and include real-time bidding for media placement and analytics.

By analyzing consumer information and targeting ad placement, we are able to optimize the performance of an ad campaign for an advertiser while providing a more relevant and meaningful online experience for consumers who view the ads we deliver.
This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices with respect to the information we collect on behalf of our clients through our Technology, as well as the information collected on our own Web site.
RUN is committed to privacy and this Privacy Policy outlines the kinds of information we collect, how we collect information, how we use and disclose collected information, and how you can control, correct and/or update the information.

Information Collection through our Technology for Interest Based Advertising
Information We Collect through our Technology

  Our Technology does not collect information that can be used to directly identify an individual, such as your name, physical address, e-mail address, Social Security Number, credit card number, account numbers, passwords, personal health information or precise, real-time geographic location derived through location-based services such as GPS-enabled devices.
As part of the process of delivering ads through our Technology, we do collect information about your interaction with our Technology, your web browsing activity and your device, which in some jurisdictions may be considered personally identifiable information.
This information may include information such as your device type (e.g., a computer, tablet, smartphone, gaming console or smart/connected TV), your IP address, device identifiers, non-precise location information, the date and time of your visit, browser type, web pages visited when viewing an ad, and information about your interaction with our Technology when viewing content on your device, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (viewed a video ad to completion or clicked on an ad), and what content you viewed (which advertisement we delivered to you).
For example, if you visit a number of automobile-related web sites, you may be flagged as being interested in purchasing an automobile.
==========
RUN also obtains non-PII such as behavioral, contextual and demographic information from third party providers that we can use to serve interest-based ads.
RUN's Technology may process information to retarget an individual across multiple devices (e.g., you may receive advertisements about automobiles on your computer because based on your browsing activity on your mobile device, you have been flagged as being interested in purchasing an automobile).
In order to provide content-relevant ads to mobile users, we may also collect carrier IDs (from US users only), information about the apps you use and the location of your device if you have elected to provide that information to the publishers with whom we have partnered.
As described in the next section, since this information is collected through cookies, we require our clients to obtain any legally required consents to allow us to place cookies on their web sites and collect information from you.
Even if you consent, you can revoke your consent at any time by opting out as described below.
==========
How We Collect Information through our Technology

  For information that we collect, directly or indirectly, we typically employ the use of "pixel tags" and/or "cookies," which are commonly used on the Internet.
Pixel tags and cookies help us understand how you use a publisher's web site and the effectiveness of an ad so that we can more accurately deliver the types of ads that are relevant to your interests.
Pixel tags or cookies do not in any way damage your operating system or files.
You can refuse RUN cookies, but doing so may result in the receipt of the same ads or ads that do not cater to your interests.
To permanently object to the placing of RUN cookies on your computer, you can use the opt-out process described below.
==========
Pixel tags are small bits of code that reside on a web site and provide a method of information delivery allowing the operator of the page or a third party to collect information about the visitors to the page.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on the browser of your computer that assign an anonymous identifier to your browser and provide information to the cookie sender.
In addition to cookies, RUN also uses mobile identifiers such as device IDs that are specific to an individual’s hardware, as well as statistical methods for identifying an individual across multiple devices with a high degree of accuracy.
==========
RUN also receives information from 3rd party data providers who collect and make available information such as behavioral, contextual, and demographic information, for our clients to use in targeting ads through our platform.
For example, our clients may use health-related segments such as an inferred interest in health and wellness (e.g., personal training or gym membership).
(Click here for a complete list of Health-related segments provided by 3rd party data providers that may be used in RUN's platform).
How We Use Information Collected Through Our Technology

  RUN uses information it receives and collects through its Technology to tailor, target, and assess the effectiveness of the ads we deliver to you, and to avoid showing you the same ads repeatedly.
==========
Our analysis includes contextual and demographic elements, behaviors and viewing preferences, and we use this information to predict the characteristics and preferences of the viewers on web sites that use our Technology.
We report this information to our advertiser clients in an aggregated, anonymous form to assist them in targeting their ad campaigns to a relevant Internet audience, and to our web site owner clients to gain an understanding of the general make-up of individuals who visit their site(s).
Collectively, this information assists advertisers and web site owners in delivering effective ad campaigns to their audience and allows for a more relevant and meaningful ad experience for the consumer.
==========
We may offer our clients the use of a data management platform to enable them to manage their own customer information.
Each of our clients’ separate privacy policies govern the collection and use of this information.
However, if you opt-out of our services by following the instructions below, you will no longer receive interest-based ads from RUN.
Information Collection from Our Company Web Site

  We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) from our Web site when you choose to provide it to us.

Once collected, we will maintain your PII for as long as reasonably required to fulfill your request, carry out the purpose for which the PII was collected, or satisfy RUN’s legal and business obligations.
We also automatically collect information via the Web site through the use of various technologies, including cookies and pixel tags.
We collect IP address, browsing behavior and device IDs.

We use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Web site and to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to improve our online presence.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can adjust the preferences in the browser of your computer or device to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or to block some or all cookies.
While you may still use our Web site if you reject cookies, your ability to use some areas of our Web site may be limited.

RUN is an active member of the industry associations that govern the use and policies around online consumer privacy including the IAB, the DAA in the US (including the DAA AppChoices Program for smartphones and tablets), the DAAC (youradchoices.ca) and the NAI (www.networkadvertising.org).
RUN complies with the IAB Code of Conduct, the NAI Code of Conduct and the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
We believe that these codes and principles help protect and ensure individual consumer privacy.
RUN also uses a DAA-Approved platform to comply with the ‘Enhanced Notice' standard as dictated by the cross-industry Self-Regulation Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
As part of this service, advertisements served by RUN's platform or other parties we do business with, are sometimes delivered with icons that serve as a signal to consumers that behavioral information has been used.
Through the icon, consumers can learn how their information is being used and by what companies, and access tools to control the collection and use of their information.
==========
When you opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from RUN, we will place a cookie in your web browser that identifies you as opted-out.
Our Technology will recognize your opt-out cookie and will preclude advertisers using RUN Technology from displaying interest-based ads to you.
However, the choice to opt-out is unique to the browser in which you set it and you may need to repeat your opt-out election if you use a different computer or change browsers.
Also, the opt-out cookie cannot be set if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
==========
Opting out via this method does not prevent the use of cookies or similar means that are necessary for the operation of the Web site or other legitimate purposes unrelated to serving interest-based ads.
Information may still be collected about your web browsing activities for these other purposes.
While you will not receive ads based on your interests derived from your online behavior, you will still see advertising, including contextual ads that are based on the content of the web page that you visit.
For US users only, RUN's mobile platform Technology allows us to provide interest-based ads based on information we collect through our carrier partner, Verizon.
If you are a Verizon customer, you may opt-out of this targeting by calling 866-211-0874 and following the opt-out instructions or by signing in as a registered user at MyVerizon.com, clicking on the link entitled, "Manage Privacy Settings" and selecting your preferences regarding Relevant Mobile Advertising.
