Our use of cookies and web beacons
We may collect information about you automatically when you visit the Website, using cookies and web beacons.
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by your web browser when you first visit the Website.
The cookie allows us to identify your computer and find out details about your last visit.
A web beacon is a small graphic image placed on a web page that is designed to allow us to monitor traffic on the Website.
==========
Cookies and web beacons are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide business and marketing information to the owners of websites.
If you choose not to receive cookies, we cannot guarantee that your experience with the Website will be as quick or responsive as if you do receive cookies.
The information collected by cookies and web beacons does not personally identify you; it includes general information about your computer settings, your connection to the Internet e.g. operating system and platform, IP address, your browsing patterns and timings of browsing on the Website and your location.
==========
Most Internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer but turning off cookies may adversely affect the way in which the website operates.
Five types of cookie may be used during your visit to the Website:
1.
Session Cookie
These are used to maintain your identity on the Website.
Non-persistent cookies are saved only while your web browser is running.
They can be used by a web server only until you close your browser when they are deleted.
They are not saved on your disk.
==========
Session cookies do not collect information from the user’s computer.
They typically will store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user.
==========
Persistent cookies are stored on your computer hard disk.
They stay on your hard disk and can be accessed by web servers until they are deleted or have expired.
Persistent cookies are used to collect identifying information about the user, such as web surfing behaviour or user preferences for a specific site and so that we can recognise you on your return, eg if you want to remain logged in to the Website.
You can change settings on your browser to accept non-persistent cookies but reject persistent cookies if you wish.
2.
Analytics cookies
These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it.
This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance.
3.
Personalisation cookies
These are used to recognise repeat visitors to the Website and in conjunction with other information we hold to attempt to record specific browsing information (that is, about the way you arrive at the Website, pages you view, options you select, information you enter and path you take through the Website).
These are used to recommend stories we think you'll be interested in based on what you're read before.

Our advertising partners will serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to the Website and other websites (this information is anonymous in that it does not include your name, street address, e-mail address or telephone number).
In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer.
