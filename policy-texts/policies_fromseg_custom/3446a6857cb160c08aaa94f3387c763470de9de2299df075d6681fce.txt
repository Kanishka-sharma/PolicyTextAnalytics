At Ookla, we understand that our business is built on trust.
You're trusting us to measure your broadband speeds accurately, but it's just as important that you're trusting us to not abuse your privacy.
Helping you understand your connection isn't just about giving you the raw numbers.
==========
Identifying what they mean as part of a bigger picture empowers you to get the most for your money.
While we do collect some information to help paint that bigger picture, it's information about your broadband connection, not you personally.
We use that data to build powerful tools like Net Index, which helps you evaluate ISPs around the world.
We contribute back through Google's Public Data Explorer, so everyone from researchers to laypersons can chart how broadband has changed tremendously over just the last few years in all parts of the world.
And sometimes we get the opportunity to work with individuals, companies, and even governments throughout the globe, helping them understand the broadband picture and recognize your needs.
Just as we want you to understand your broadband connection, we also want you to understand what sort of data we're collecting with Speedtest.net, associated online services and our mobile applications ("Ookla Services").
So below, we've explained it in full detail.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
==========
Test Results
We may store the results of any tests that you run on Ookla Services ("Test Results").
The Test Results may include the actual measurement numbers, your network address, details of the device and network on which the test was run, and location information.
We use geolocation data based on your network address, Google's Location Service or global positioning services to determine approximately where you are located.
==========
Registration Information
Registering an account for certain Ookla Services may require a valid email address.
We may email you with information related to Ookla Services, but we will never give your email address to others.
Partner Sites
Some Ookla Services are accessed through third party sites.
Personal and other information that you send to those sites may be sent to us.
