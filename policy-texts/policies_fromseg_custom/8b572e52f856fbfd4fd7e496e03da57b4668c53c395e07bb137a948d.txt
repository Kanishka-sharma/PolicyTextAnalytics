CondéNet Inc. and the Condé Nast Publications (the "Service Providers") understand and respect our customers' desire for privacy.
To that end, we would like you to know how we use the personal information you provide to us.
We collect certain information (e.g., name and address) that is necessary to fulfill magazine subscriptions.
This information is collected from all customers.
We collect other information (e.g., e-mail address or telephone number) so that we may more efficiently communicate with subscribers when necessary.
While we request that subscribers provide this information, it is not required.
Occasionally, we also attempt to collect demographic data from our subscribers (e.g. job, title, age, etc.).
This information is used by our editors to better understand our subscribers and by our advertisers to target their advertisements.
It is not required for magazine fulfillment and should be submitted at the subscriber's discretion.

In addition, we may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer.
The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, but allows us to relate a user's use of our site to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided.

All data entry forms are sent to a third party solely for purposes of fulfilling your order and processing your requested transaction.
Sometimes we also use and/or provide your personally identifiable information (excluding your credit card number) to third parties who we feel may have information of interest to you.
