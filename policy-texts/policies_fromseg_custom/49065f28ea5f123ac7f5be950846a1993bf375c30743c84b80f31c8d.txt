If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.
Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out for use of your personal information by third parties for their own marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
We qualify for the alternative option; If you are a California resident and you want to opt out of such sharing, please send your request via email or postal mail.
To make such a request, please send an e-mail to LegalPrivacyTeam@quickenloans.com or write us:
Quicken Loans Inc.
Attn: Legal Team
1050 Woodward Avenue
Detroit, MI 48226
All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.
For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email.
Please include your zip code for our own record-keeping).

Legal rights applicable to personal data collected in the EEA.
Pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679) (“GDPR”) natural persons (called data subjects) are afforded certain rights regarding their personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of, and receive a portable copy in a usable electronic format of your personal information.
You also have the right to withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us.
==========
If you would like to exercise any of the rights outlined above, and the law of your jurisdiction requires us to honor that request, please send your request in writing to the address above.
To assist us in processing your request in timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so.
Your request should include any information relevant to your request, including, without limitation: (i) your name, email and postal address; (ii) the specific right you are asserting (e.g., removal); and (iii) if you are requesting removal, a brief explanation of why you believe such information should be removed.
To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies your identity.
You need not provide a government-issued document; a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice.
You may also obscure parts of the document such as identifying numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you.
If you are making the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of your authority to make such request.
All requests for removal will be reviewed by Dictionary’s legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.
==========
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about privacy.
If, however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your complaint or concern, you may have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your country of residence.
