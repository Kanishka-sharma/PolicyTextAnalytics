Notice of privacy practices
Dear Mayo Clinic Patient:
Mayo Clinic has always been a leader in protecting patients' medical information.
Maintaining patient privacy is part of our mission to serve the needs of the patient first.
Controlled use of medical information by staff at Mayo Clinic is essential to providing optimum patient care.
The United States government created rules for the use and protection of medical and health information by hospitals, clinics and other medical practices.
==========
The rules are a result of the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
They are meant to provide all patients in the United States with standard privacy protections.
One rule requires hospitals and clinics to provide all patients with a Notice of Privacy Practices to explain how patient medical information is used.
The same rule requires hospitals and clinics to keep records showing that patients have received the notice.
We are happy to provide you with this copy of Mayo Clinic's Notice of Privacy Practices.
We hope it will answer any questions you may have about how patient medical information is used here.
==========
In accordance with the federal government HIPAA rules, please sign the form that came with this notice and bring it with you to your appointment.
Signing the form will show that you have received the notice; it will in no way affect the care you receive at Mayo Clinic.
If you have questions about anything contained in this notice, please feel free to contact the site privacy officer for the applicable Mayo Clinic entity.
Contact information for these individuals is provided in the final section of this notice.
Thank you for placing your care, and your trust, in Mayo Clinic.
Sincerely,


John H. Noseworthy, M.D. President and CEO, Mayo Clinic

Mayo Clinic's duties
By law, Mayo Clinic must keep protected health information private.
The federal government defines protected health information as any information, whether oral, electronic or paper, which is created or received by Mayo Clinic and relates to a patient's physical or mental health or condition, or payment for the provision of medical services.
This includes not only the results of tests and notes written by doctors, nurses and other clinical personnel, but also certain demographic information (such as your name, address and telephone number) that is related to your health records.
==========
Mayo Clinic is required by law to give you this notice and to follow the terms and conditions of the notice that is currently in effect.
Mayo Clinic will report breaches of your unsecured protected health information as required by law.
How Mayo Clinic fulfills these duties

Mayo Clinic considers patient privacy as part of its mission to serve the needs of the patient first.
Mayo Clinic takes necessary precautions against inappropriate use or disclosure of protected health information.
Mayo Clinic employees are expected to access protected health information only as necessary to perform their jobs.
Mayo Clinic employees who violate these rules and policies are subject to sanctions, including discipline and termination.
The Health Care Providers Covered By This Notice
This notice covers Mayo Clinic and Mayo Clinic personnel, volunteers, students, and trainees.
The notice also covers other health care providers that come to Mayo Clinic's facilities to care for patients (such as physicians, physician assistants, therapists, and other health care providers not employed by Mayo Clinic), unless these other health care providers give you their own notice of privacy practices that describes how they will protect your protected health information.
Mayo Clinic may share your protected health information with these other health care providers for their treatment, payment and health care operations.
==========
This arrangement is only for sharing information and not for any other purpose.
A Word about Federal and State Law
Federal and state laws require Mayo Clinic to protect your medical information and federal law requires Mayo Clinic to describe to you how we handle that information.
When federal and state privacy laws differ, and the state law is more protective of your information or provides you with greater access to your information, then state law will override federal law.
For example, where we have specifically identified additional applicable state law requirements in this notice, the referenced Mayo entities will follow the more stringent state law requirements.
==========
Part I — Most Common Uses and Disclosures
This section describes the most common circumstances in which Mayo Clinic may use or disclose protected health information.

This includes communication and consultation between health care providers — doctors, nurses, technicians and other members of your medical team.
This applies to disclosures for treatment purposes to health care providers both within and outside of Mayo Clinic.
For example, following orthopedic surgery, your doctor may refer you for rehabilitation.
Information will be shared between caregivers to ensure continuity of care.
==========

Minnesota Law generally requires patient consent for disclosures of protected health information by Mayo Clinic in Minnesota entities for treatment purposes, unless the disclosure is to a Mayo-related entity or consent is not possible due to a medical emergency.
Wisconsin Law requires your written consent to disclose information from your mental health records for treatment outside a treatment facility and in non-emergency situations.
Payment

Here are some examples:

To reduce the infection rate after a surgery, it would be necessary to look at medical records to determine the rate of infections that occurred.
To be licensed to do a certain procedure, a doctor may be required to show that he or she has successfully completed a number of procedures under the supervision of another physician.
==========
A Federal Drug Administration inspector may review patient records in a laboratory to ensure that accurate and complete records are maintained for patient safety.
Mayo facilities across the country, including but not limited to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Mayo Clinic in Florida and Mayo Clinic in Arizona, and the Mayo Clinic Health System clinics and hospitals in Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, also work closely together to improve health care operations across the Mayo Clinic system, and we may use protected health information for those activities.

Mayo Clinic does not sell or rent patients' names or addresses to any organization outside of Mayo.
==========
Facility Directory/Patient Census
Mayo Clinic may include your name, location in a facility, health condition (in general terms, such as "good," "fair") and religious affiliation (should you choose to provide one) in current patient lists for our facilities.
This information is maintained for Mayo Clinic personnel to assist family members and other visitors or persons in locating you while you are in Mayo Clinic's facilities.
For example, a relative may wish to visit you in the hospital and would need to know your hospital room number.
==========
A family member meeting you for an appointment may have forgotten which floor your appointment is on.
This information is only shared with people who ask for you by name or with members of the clergy.
If you indicate a religious affiliation, it will be shared only with members of the clergy.
==========

Family Members and Others Involved in Your Care
Mayo Clinic may disclose relevant protected health information to a family member or friend who is involved with your care.
==========
We find that many patients want us to discuss their care with their family members and others to keep them up-to-date on your care, to help you understand your care, to help in handling your bills, or to help in the scheduling of your appointments.
In a disaster situation, we also may disclose relevant protected health information to disaster relief organizations to help locate your family members or friends or to inform them of your location, condition or death.
If family members or friends are present while care is being provided, Mayo Clinic will assume your companions may hear the discussion, unless you state otherwise.
If you do not want Mayo Clinic to disclose your protected health information to your family members or others who are involved with your care or handling your bills, please inform the person assisting you during registration and/or admission.

Additional Applicable State Law Requirements
Iowa law permits mental health professionals to disclose a limited amount of protected health information (including information about diagnosis, medication, and treatment plan) to your spouse, parent, adult child or adult sibling if you have a chronic mental illness.
The disclosure will be made only if the family member is directly involved in your care and if the disclosure is necessary to assist the family member in caring for you.
Unless you have been found incompetent, we will notify you of these disclosures.
Wisconsin law requires your written consent to share protected health information in most situations to family members or friends.
==========

Additionally, with respect to behavioral health treatment, except drug and alcohol treatment programs, Mayo Clinic Health System may provide a patient's attorney and guardian ad litem, as well as County Corporation Counsel, your protected health information to prepare for matters related to detention, admission or commitment; release protected health information that would assist apprehension of a patient who has left the behavioral health unit without permission (where such permission is required).
You have the right to request a restriction on the above notifications.
==========
Medical Research
Medical research is vital to the advancement of medical science.
Federal regulations permit use of protected health information in medical research, either with your authorization, when your name and most other identifiers have been removed and the recipient of the information signs a data use agreement, or when the research study at Mayo Clinic is reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board before any medical research study begins.
In some situations, limited information may be used before approval of the research study to allow a researcher to determine whether enough patients exist to make a study scientifically valid.
Additional Applicable State Law Requirements
Minnesota law generally requires patient consent for disclosures of protected health information by Mayo Clinic in Minnesota Entities to outside researchers for medical research purposes.
Mayo Clinic in Minnesota Entities will obtain such consent from their patients or refusal to participate in any research study, or will make a good faith effort to obtain such consent or refusal, before releasing any identifiable information to an outside researcher for research purposes.
==========
Wisconsin law generally requires a written consent before we may disclose protected health information for research purposes to a researcher who is not affiliated with Mayo Clinic.
In some situations, Mayo Clinic may disclose protected health information for research purposes to a researcher who agrees to protect the privacy of your information.
Private pay patients may be able to opt out of the use or disclosure of your information for research purposes.

Part III Patients' Rights with Respect to Protected Health Information
This section describes the rights of Mayo Clinic patients to protected health information.
Right to Inspect and Copy
You have the right to inspect and to request a copy of information maintained in Mayo Clinic's designated medical record about you.
This includes medical and billing records maintained and used by Mayo Clinic to make decisions about your care.
To obtain or inspect a copy of your protected health information, submit a written request to the applicable Mayo Clinic entity and address the request to the attention of the Health Information Management Services.
Mayo Clinic generally may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee to cover the expense of providing copies.
Mayo Arizona Entities are not permitted under Arizona law to charge a fee if the information is needed for treatment purposes.
Most patients have full access to inspect and receive a copy of the full medical record.
On rare occasions, Mayo Clinic may deny a request to inspect and receive a copy of some information in the medical record.
==========
For example, this may occur if, in the professional judgment of a patient's physician, the release of the information would be reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the patient or another person.
Additional Applicable State Law Requirements
Wisconsin law permits most patients to have full access to inspect and receive a copy of the full medical record.
On rare occasions, Mayo Clinic may deny a request to inspect and receive a copy of some information in the medical record when, in the professional judgment of a physician, denial of access is necessary to prevent an imminent and substantial danger to the patient or others.
Right to Request Alternate Methods of Communication
You have a right to request that Mayo Clinic communicate with you in certain ways (such as a letter or by phone) or at a certain location.
==========
For example, you may ask that we contact you only at home or only at your place of business.
In this situation, you may submit a written request to the applicable Mayo Clinic entity specifying the communication method or alternative location being requested.
The request should be addressed to the attention of the Site Privacy Officer.
Mayo Clinic will accommodate reasonable requests.
However, if the request could result in Mayo Clinic not being able to collect for services or cause significant administrative burden, Mayo Clinic reserves the right to require you to provide additional information about how payment for services will be handled.
Right to Request Amendment
You have the right to request that your protected health information in Mayo Clinic's designated medical record for you be amended.
If you wish to request amendment of the information in your record, submit a written request to the applicable Mayo Clinic entity and address the request to the attention of the Health Information Management Services.
==========
The request must include a reason to support the amendment.
Mayo Clinic may deny a request for amendment based upon any of the following circumstances:

the request is not in writing or does not include a supporting reason; 
the information you want to change was not created by Mayo Clinic, and the originator of the information is available to make the amendment; 
the information is not part of the designated medical record; or 
the information in the record is accurate and complete.
If Mayo Clinic denies your request for an amendment, Mayo Clinic will give you a written explanation of the denial.
If you still disagree with the explanation provided, you can submit your written disagreement to Mayo Clinic as referenced above, or you can ask that your request for amendment and explanation of the denial, or an accurate summary of such information, be included in any future disclosure of the pertinent protected health information.
If you submit a statement of disagreement, Mayo Clinic may include a rebuttal statement addressing your statement of disagreement in the designated medical record.
==========
Right to a List of Certain Disclosures
You can ask Mayo Clinic for a list of the persons or organizations to which Mayo Clinic has disclosed your protected health information.
This list would provide you with a summary of certain disclosures Mayo Clinic has made that you would not otherwise be in a position to know about.
The following are examples of disclosures that would not be included in the list:

disclosures to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations; 
disclosures made directly to you (the patient) or disclosures that you have specifically authorized; 
disclosures made from the facility directory/patient census; 
disclosures to persons involved in your care; 
disclosures incident to a use or disclosure that is otherwise permitted or required by law; 
disclosures made for national security or intelligence purposes; 
disclosures made to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials having custody over a patient; or 
disclosures that took place before April 14, 2003.
To obtain a copy of the list, submit a written request to the applicable Mayo Clinic entity and address the request to the attention of the Site Privacy Officer.
==========
Your request must state a time period (beginning no earlier than April 14, 2003 when the federal privacy rules go into effect and for no longer than six years).
The first list requested within a 12-month period shall be provided at no charge.
For additional lists requested during the same 12-month period, Mayo Clinic may charge for the costs of providing the list.
Right to Request Restrictions
You can ask Mayo Clinic to restrict the use or disclosure of protected health information about you for treatment, payment, or health care operations.
If you or someone on your behalf pays for a health care item or service in full, you can request that Mayo Clinic not disclose information about the item or service to your health plan for payment or health care operations purposes, and Mayo Clinic will agree to your request unless required by law to make the disclosure.
Your request must be in writing and submitted to the applicable Mayo Clinic entity.
The request should also be addressed to the attention of the Site Privacy Officer.
Mayo Clinic will carefully consider all requests.
However, because of the integrated nature of Mayo Clinic's medical record, Mayo Clinic is not generally able to honor most requests, nor is Mayo Clinic legally required to do so.
==========
Right to Notice of Privacy Practices
You have the right to obtain a paper copy of this notice upon request, even if you have agreed to receive the notice electronically.
To obtain a paper copy of this notice, submit a written request to the any Mayo Clinic entity.
The request should be addressed to the attention of the Site Privacy Officer.
