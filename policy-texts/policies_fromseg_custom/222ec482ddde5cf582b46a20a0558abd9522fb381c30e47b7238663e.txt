Terms of Service
This is the terms of use agreement (the “Agreement”) that governs your use of Social Blade’s website, apps, and data.
If you do not agree with these terms, please stop using Social Blade’s website, uninstall our apps, and refrain from using our data.
General Terms
Social Blade may change any of the terms and conditions in this Agreement at any time for any reason.
A notice of material change will be posted on Social Blade’s website, and you are responsible for reviewing the changes.
If you do not agree with them, do not continue to use Social Blade’s website, uninstall our apps, and refrain from using our data.
Social Blade does not provide any guarantee or warranty of the accuracy of any data.
By using Social Blade, you are certifying that you are over 13 years of age and have your legal guardian’s permission.
==========
The data Social Blade provides is public information.
It is gathered by Social Blade’s proprietary software from 3rd party sources.
The data is then collated, organized, manipulated, and displayed in unique ways by Social Blade.
This makes the data proprietary.
==========
Data Rights
Sharing Social Blade’s data, including screen shots or images of Social Blade’s website, is allowed providing you credit Social Blade as the source of said data and/or images.
The acceptable way to do this is to provide a link back to the source of the data, and clearly state in text that Social Blade provides the data.
==========
This includes sharing our data on Social Media websites, on blogs, and in any sort of publication.
Data that is shared from Social Blade on YouTube videos should include a link in the description, and a verbal or written acknowledgement of Social Blade as the source of the data in the video itself.
Mass copying data from Social Blade’s website (to include botting, crawling, scraping, etc.) is not allowed and may result in you being blocked from Social Blade’s website and data.
The only way you may gather large amounts of data is through our custom reports function, or by requesting data directly from Social Blade (email our staff, or submit a support ticket).
It is Social Blade’s policy to not delete data on our website.
All the data on our website is gathered from public sources, and Social Blade will continue to display said data.
==========
If you want us to stop displaying the statistics of your channel/account from a third party (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, Instagram), you will have to adjust your privacy settings on said third party website.
Again just to reinstate, the data shown on Social Blade is the same public data anyone could get by visiting your profile on various social media sites and writing it down.
We do not display private data.
If we were to delete or change any of the data shown it would ruin our journalstic/encylopedic integrity.
If you want a private social media profile simply mark it as private on that site and we won't collect its public data, otherwise we will.
Data Sources
In order to keep statistical data updated, Social Blade utilizes API services of third parties including but not limited to Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, Twitter, Daily Motion, and YouTube.
==========
Unless specific access is asked for at time of use (i.e. to validate your identity), we are only gathering publicly available data from each of the API services, not anything private about your account.
When private data is granted, collected data via the private token isn't being stored, it is just being used to verify various things such as how many views you recieved in the last month to see if you qualify of for services and to show that you are the verified owner of the account.
If you wish to revoke access you can do so via each platform's connected services page, or open a support ticket and we will delete the token form our system.
==========
Channel Management / Consulting
By signing up for channel management, the channel owner will be authorizing Social Blade to work on their YouTube channel as a channel manager.
The channel owner also agrees that Social Blade is not liable for any damages to the YouTube channel.
In both Channel Management and Consulting sessions Social Blade will use best business practices to promote managed YouTube channels using Search Engine Optimization, but results are not guaranteed.
