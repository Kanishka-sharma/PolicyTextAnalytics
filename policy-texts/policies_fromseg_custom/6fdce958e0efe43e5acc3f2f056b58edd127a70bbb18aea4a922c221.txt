MICRO FOCUS MARKETPLACE END USER PARTICIPATION TERMS
These MICRO FOCUS MARKETPLACE END USER PARTICIPATION TERMS ("Participation Terms") are a legal contract between you and, as applicable, Micro Focus International plc or one of its group companies or affiliates ("Micro Focus") and apply to your use of a Micro Focus marketplace (the "Marketplace") and your use of applications made available in the Marketplace (each, an "Application").
These Participation Terms are effective beginning with your initial use of the Marketplace.
1.
==========
INTRODUCTION: Before accessing the Marketplace or any Application, carefully read these Participation Terms which are in addition to the Micro Focus Website Terms of Use set forth at www.microfocus.com/about/legal ("Website Terms of Use").
To the extent there is any conflict between these Participation Terms and the Website Terms of Use, these Participation Terms shall control.
The licensor of each Application (the "Application Provider") is either Micro Focus or a third-party licensor.
The Application Provider licenses the Application to you, the original end user, either for free or for a charge, solely for your organization's internal purposes as set forth below and subject to the applicable end user license agreement.
Your use of each Application that you download through the Marketplace is governed by the terms of the End User License Agreement specified by the Application Provider (the "EULA").
Where Micro Focus is the Application Provider, the license to the Application is governed by the Micro Focus EULA found at www.microfocus.com/en-us/legal/software-licensing, effective beginning with your initial use of that Application.
Please note that Micro Focus has authorized third parties to contribute Applications of such third parties to the Marketplace and the use of that third-party Application is governed by the terms and conditions specified by the third party rather than by the Micro Focus EULA.
==========
If you do not agree to these Participation Terms, you may not use, download from, or otherwise access the Marketplace.
Using, downloading, or otherwise accessing any part of the Marketplace indicates that you accept these Participation Terms.
You must be at least 13 (thirteen) years of age to use or access the Marketplace.
If you are at least 13 but under the age of 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use or access the marketplace.

==========
LIMITED ROLE OF MICRO FOCUS: Your agreement with each third-party Application Provider is a binding agreement between you and that Application Provider only.
Such third party is solely responsible for the corresponding Application, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims relating to that Application.
You acknowledge that, except in situations where Micro Focus is the Application Provider, Micro Focus is not a party to the agreement between you and the Application Provider.
Micro Focus is not responsible for any third-party Application, the content therein, or any warranties or claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Application.
You further acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any Application for which Micro Focus is not the Application Provider, Micro Focus is a third-party beneficiary of the corresponding EULA and, in such capacity, has the right to enforce such EULA against you.

Each Application is licensed for use only for a single Micro Focus account, and you may not distribute or make the Application available over a network or for use with multiple devices.
You may not modify or alter an Application or use it other than as expressly authorized by the corresponding EULA; provided that, if applicable law permits you to copy or modify the Application, then you may copy and modify the Application solely to the extent, and for such purposes as, expressly permitted by applicable law.

Micro Focus may, without prior notice or liability to you, remove, disable access to, block, or modify remotely any Applications previously downloaded by you from the Marketplace.
