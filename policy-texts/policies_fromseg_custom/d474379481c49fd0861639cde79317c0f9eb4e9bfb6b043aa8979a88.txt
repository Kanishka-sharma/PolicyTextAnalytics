The Casale Media Online Advertising Network uses cookies for the purposes of tracking when an Internet user has seen an advertisement.
These cookies do not and will not provide Casale Media with any Personally Identifiable information.
Instead, these cookies are used to inform the Casale Media Online Advertising Network if an advertisement has been served to the same computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served.
We use both session and persistent cookies on our website.
These are needed for site navigation and aggregate analysis of what is viewed on our site.

Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information
All information shared with both advertisers and publishers within the Casale Media online advertising network is done so in an aggregate fashion.
This allows us to provide members of the advertising network with broad percentages regarding the users who are receiving advertisements through the network.
However, this data is not linked to any form of Personally Identifiable information.
Information collected by advertisers on their websites who are members of the Casale Media online advertising network may contain Personally Identifiable information.
However, data such as this is provided by the individual Internet user in the form of online order forms, contests, or otherwise through the members website, not casalemedia.com.
==========
This Personally Identifiable information collected outside the Casale Media Online Advertising Network is subject to the privacy policies of the individual advertisers involved.
The Casale Media Online Advertising Network prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to Internet users.
Our proprietary targeting methodologies enable advertisers to effectively target their campaigns to the audience(s) they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices, which invade the privacy of Internet users.
==========
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.
This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
