What personally identifiable information does MapQuest.com collect from me?
MapQuest.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of Web sites.
Some personal information is gathered when you register.
During registration, MapQuest.com asks for your name, email address, and other personal information.
The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience.
==========
Once you register you are no longer anonymous to MapQuest.com and are able to take full advantage of MapQuest.com's many offerings.
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by MapQuest.com and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase at MapQuest.com's store; when you make travel arrangements using MapQuest.com; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services.
MapQuest.com also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for internal research.
Wherever MapQuest.com collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
What are cookies and how does MapQuest.com use them?
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, MapQuest.com may use cookies to store and sometimes track your information.

How does MapQuest.com use my information?
MapQuest.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites.
==========
This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you.
In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements.
By knowing a little
about you, MapQuest.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.
In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, MapQuest.com plays the middleman.
Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old).
==========
MapQuest.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria.
In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information.
Only MapQuest.com has access to individuals' accounts.
==========
This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email.
You will only receive special offers via email from MapQuest.com if you have indicated during registration that you would like to receive them.
You can change your preferences at any time.
==========
MapQuest.com does internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, or from our server log files.
We do this to better understand and serve our users.
This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
==========

How does MapQuest.com protect my personal financial information?
Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us.
As with all personal information, MapQuest.com will never rent or sell your personal financial information.
Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements.
But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission.
Please note that there may be places on the MapQuest.com network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes.
Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format.
We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
==========
Your MapQuest.com registration information is password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information.
You may edit your MapQuest.com registration information by using your MapQuest.com username and password.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
MapQuest.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.
We recommend that you should not ask MapQuest.com to remember your username or password on a computer that can be accessed by others.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
==========
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, MapQuest.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
==========
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration information.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
