Our Privacy Policy
Our policy is simple: any information of any sort we hold about our users (for example email addresses) we don't, and we not ever, share with anyone else.
A note about cookies: We provide Google adverts on many of our pages.
Users should be aware that:

Google uses cookies to serve these ads on this site.
A cookie is a small token that is saved by your browser and, in this case, indicates that you have visited our site.
==========
This may enable Google to provide more relevant adverts for you when you visit any other site.
The name of the cookie that Google uses for this is the DART cookie.
If you prefer not to have this cookie saved by your browser, you may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
Third party companies like Google  may  may use information (not  including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about  your visits to this and other websites in order to provide  advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
We use a Google Analytics feature  based on Display Advertising (e.g. Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).
You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customise Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings.
We  will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that are based on the DoubleClick cookie unless we have  notice of, and the your prior affirmative  consent to, that merger.
