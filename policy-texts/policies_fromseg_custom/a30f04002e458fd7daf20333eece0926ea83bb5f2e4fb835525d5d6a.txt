Legacy.com, Inc., Privacy Policy   
      Our pledge to you   
   Legacy.com respects your privacy.
We do not sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information to any third party about our visitors.
Any information you give us is treated with the utmost care and security.
==========
Terminology   
   Legacy.com realizes many of our visitors may be unfamiliar with some of the terms contained in our Privacy Policy.
To facilitate each visitor's understanding of our Policy, many terms within this Policy contain links to their respective definitions on www.whatis.com, an online dictionary of information technology terms.
Use of information   
      General
Legacy.com does not collect personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.
==========
Examples of personal information are name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number.
Personal information is collected from Legacy Guest Book submissions and Legacy Notice and Life Story orders.
This site makes Legacy Guest Books, Life Stories, and Notices available to all our visitors.
Please remember that any information disclosed in a Legacy Guest Book, or any information posted within a Life Story or Notice, becomes public information.
You therefore should exercise caution when disclosing any personal information in these forums.
==========
Information also is collected as our server logs automatically receive and record information from your browser, including your IP address and the page(s) you requested.
Legacy.com uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our Web server, and to administer our Web site.
Other purposes of collecting such information are to customize the advertising you see on our pages and to fulfill visitors' requests for certain products and services.
IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
==========
Legacy.com will never share any information about our visitors with partners or other third parties, and will never sell or share any information at the individual customer level, unless our visitors have provided consent for us to do so.
Advertising
Non-personally identifiable information provided by visitors may be used to enhance advertising campaigns on behalf of the organizations advertising at the Legacy.com site, thus ensuring visitors to the site receive advertisements they may find relevant.
For example, geographical information may be used to ensure that visitors only view advertisements for businesses and organizations located within their region.
Although information may be used internally to develop advertising, it will not be provided to the organizations advertising at our site and it will never be associated with visitors' online activities (whether involving purchasing trends or general Internet usage trends).
Legacy.com currently uses the DoubleClick DART ad serving solution to host our advertising program.
It is DoubleClick's ad serving technology that is responsible for serving the advertisements visitors see at Legacy.com.
The primary purpose of this arrangement is to assure our advertisers that advertising campaigns are being executed in the best possible manner.
Additionally, it provides advertisers with a means to review their advertising campaigns at any given time.
==========
Finally, through DoubleClick technology, visitors are more likely to receive those advertisements that are relevant to them.
The Legacy.com Privacy Policy does not apply to any advertisements appearing on this site.
Legacy.com Web site visitors are thus strongly encouraged to review DoubleClick's privacy policy.
Cookies
In an effort to provide personalized services, Legacy.com uses cookies to store certain information about your visit to our Web site.
To ensure cookies are not stored on your hard disk drive, thus minimizing their possible impact on your computer, Legacy.com uses temporary cookies to track information about visitors' activities at our Web site.
==========
Monitoring specific activities allows Legacy.com to provide a customized environment for our visitors.

The Legacy.com Privacy Policy applies only to Legacy.com and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link.
Privacy alert   
      Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online — for example, in a Legacy Guest Book entry or through information contained within a Notice or Life Story — that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.
