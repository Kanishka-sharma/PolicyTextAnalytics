GE APPLIANCES PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE INTERNET
The General Electric Company ("GE") is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet.
We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we receive via the Internet.
GENERAL POLICY
In general, you can visit GE on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are 
or revealing any information about yourself.
==========
Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail 
addresses, of visitors.
This information may be aggregated on a "no names" basis to measure the number 
of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc.
GE uses this information to measure the 
use of, and improve the content of, our sites.
DISCLOSURE DETAILS
There are times, however, when GE Appliances may need information from you, 
such as your name and street 
and/or e-mail address.
==========
When information is needed, we will try to let you know, at the time of 
collection, how we will use the personal information.
Usually, the personal information we 
collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access 
specific account information.
Individual information may also be shared within the GE family of 
companies to better serve our customers' interests and needs.
Occasionally, we may make the e-mail 
addresses of those who provide information available to other reputable organizations or companies 
who products or services we believe you may find interesting or useful.
In these cases--and in the 
event you receive solicitations for products or services that are not of interest to you--you should 
promptly notify the solicitor that you do not wish to receive any further unwanted solicitations.
If you register with one of GE's business units online, we may use this information to provide you 
with custom information about GE's offering in support of your business needs.
==========
A technology called "cookies" may be used to provide you with tailored information.
A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may 
then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize when you return.
You may set your 
browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

YOUR GE APPLIANCES PRIVACY OPTIONS
GE Appliances recognizes that some customers providing their personal 
information may wish to exercise choice over how that information is used.
To accommodate our 
customers' privacy preferences, GE Appliances offers you the opportunity to "Set Your Privacy 
Options" at each point where your e-mail address is collected by us online.
By simply clicking 
your "Privacy Options" button, you will be taken instantly to an entire page dedicated to providing 
you with privacy choice.
==========
There you will be afforded the option of "opting out" of receiving online 
special promotions, discounts, or updates from GE Appliances or GEA-sponsored sites to the e-mail 
address you provided.
You will also be given the option to opt out of receiving such offerings 
from GE Appliance's carefully selected partners, such as other GE businesses and GE affiliates 
and from businesses not affiliated with GE.
If you are reading this privacy policy, and would 
prefer not to opt out--and for those customers for whom these matters are not a concern--you need 
do nothing:  your options have been pre-set to allow you to receive all the offerings described 
without further action by you.

HELPFUL PRIVACY TIPS
1.
Only provide your personal data to companies' brands you know and 
trust and whose privacy policies are clearly disclosed for you to read.
2.
==========
Spam, or unsolicited bulk e-mail, can be reduced by avoiding the following practices: 
· Posting to an online service or any Internet bulletin board
· Posting in a usenet newsgroup or mailing list
· Spending time in chat rooms or with an online service that displays your address
· Including yourself in an unprotected online service members director
· Opening any attachments to unsolicited e-mail
· Signing up for a "removal service" - you may be adding your name to a spammers list

3.
Pro-active anti-spam steps you can take include:
· Be careful about replying to a spammer, as it only confirms your active e-mail address-if you can confirm their address, send them a certified letter instructing them to stop further unsolicited e-mails 
· Open a second e-mail account for "public postings" such as newsgroups or chat rooms.
· Check whether your browsing is disclosing your address-if so, reconfigure your browser or use a free product to block it.
· Report spammers to your Internet service -their anti-spam policies may help.
