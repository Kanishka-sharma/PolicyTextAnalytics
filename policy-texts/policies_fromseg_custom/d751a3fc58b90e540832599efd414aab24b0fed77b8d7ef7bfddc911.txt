Change.org’s mission is to empower people everywhere to create the change they want to see.
We believe the best way to achieve that mission is to be a technology company using the power of business for social good.
Our Privacy Policy outlines how we get and use information about you, who we share it with, and how you can control your privacy settings.
This information helps us build technology to show you campaigns and other content that are most likely to matter to you.
This Privacy Policy covers your activities on Change.org, our platform that enables people to create the change they want to see, and Change Politics, our platform that empowers voters to make informed election decisions (“platforms”).
These platforms allow people to start and promote “campaigns”, which include petitions and fundraisers on Change.org, candidate questions and endorsements on Change Politics, and related actions like creating and sharing content via our platforms and third-party sites and services.
==========
Information we collect
To run our service and show you relevant content we need to know a little about you and your interests.
Here we outline what information Change.org collects, and how we collect it.
a.
==========
What we collectWhen you sign or create a petition via our Change.org platform, an account is created for you.
All your campaign activities are then tied to this account.If you create a Change Politics account, you submit to Change.org certain information about you for your profile, and all of your activities on the Change Politics platform are then tied to this account.
You must create a separate account for Change.org and Change Politics.Through these activities and upon your general use of our platforms, we may collect and/or receive the following information about you that reveals your specific identity, or is directly tied to your specific identity:
your name
your postal address
your telephone number
your email address, or non-email authentication if you are using a mobile device
your profile picture
other information you voluntarily submit (for example: photos, Twitter handle, biography, political party affiliation)
your unique mobile device ID number if you access our services via a mobile application
your social media account ID and information shared with us via your social media account
your specific activities on our platforms – for example, petitions you have started or signed, sponsored petitions you have signed, or campaigns you have shared or promoted
And possibly:
information inferred about the issues you care about and candidates you support based on your activities on the platforms (e.g. animal rights, climate change);
information about you available in public records, or other publicly available databases, such as civic data APIs, which, as an example, we use in the United States to help match citizens with the elected officials who represent them at all levels in government;
information about you that we get from third party data providers.
We obtain this data with assurance from these providers that you have consented to the collecting and sharing of this data.
We don’t actively collect sensitive public data such as medical data.
==========
In addition, we only collect information that is permissible to collect in each country where we operate.
If you use the Change.org platform for fundraising (either by setting up or contributing to a fundraiser), we will collect additional information:
the currency of the contribution
the amount you contributed or received
the goal amount of the fundraiser
the country and location of the fundraiser
the amount of any refund
We also collect information that does not reveal your specific identity, or does not directly relate to you, such as:
browser and device information
information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies
demographic information and other non-identifying information provided by you (such as a zip code or general geographic area)
b.
How we collect it
When you create accounts on our our platforms, you will be asked to create a user profile that includes information such as your user name, city, state, and country.
You may choose to upload photos and provide additional information as well.
==========
When you are signed in to your account, your activities on the platforms are tracked and are associated with your account.
Such activities may include signing a petition, creating a petition, sharing someone else’s petition, posting a comment, submitting or upvoting a question to a candidate, posting a candidate endorsement, following a candidate, creating or participating in a fundraiser, opting in to being contacted by an advertiser, or skipping a sponsored campaign.
When you download and use our existing or future mobile applications, we’ll collect your unique device ID and all your account and activity information will be tied to that unique device ID.
In addition, we may track and collect app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the app, and this information may be associated with your Change.org or Change Politics account.
When you use a website that allows for the posting of content to Change.org through our Application Programming Interface (“API”), your activities are recorded as if they were directly on our site and applications.
We may collect information through your activities offline, for example when you respond to user surveys or provide information if we assist you by telephone.
==========
We may obtain information about you from public records, publicly available databases, and third-party providers as described above.
We may obtain certain information through your social media accounts if they are connected to your Change.org or Change Politics account.
If you log in to Change.org or Change Politics via Facebook, we ask for your permission to access certain information about your Facebook account, activities and friends.
Social media sites make information available to all apps through their APIs, such as friend lists.
The information we receive depends on what information you or the social media site decide to give us.
Browser and device information: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the platform you are using.
==========
Cookies and online tracking: We, our service providers, and any ad networks who help us deliver relevant ads to you may use cookies, pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs), and other similar technologies to measure and track general user activities on Change.org and on third party websites.
Like other websites, Change.org will not function properly if cookies are not enabled.
Please review our Cookies Policy for more information.
==========
Third-party analytics providers: We use third-party analytics services like Google Analytics provided by Google Inc. (“Google”) and the Mixpanel service provided by Mixpanel, Inc. (“Mixpanel”).
These analytics services use cookies and similar technologies to analyze how people use our services and compile statistical reports.
Such services may also collect information about platforms’ visitors’ use of other websites.
For more information on your choices, please see our section below entitled “Your privacy choices”.
==========
IP Address: Your “IP Address” is a designator that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet service provider (ISP).
An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you use our platforms and services, along with the time of your visit and the specific page(s) that you visited.
How we may use your information
Here are the ways we might use your information to run our platforms, provide our services and serve you better content.
We use your information to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as when you create petitions, sign petitions, post comments or endorsements, upvote questions, contribute to fundraisers, or participate in other activities on our platforms, sites, apps, and third-party sites who use our API, and to complete and fulfill your transactions with us.
We need your contact information to send administrative information to you, for example, information regarding our services and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
We use your information for general business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new services, enhancing, improving, or modifying our platforms, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of campaigns, and operating and expanding our business activities.
We personalize your experience by presenting petitions, campaigns and offers tailored to you based on what we know about you.
==========
We may also send you promotional communications that we believe may be of interest to you.
If you create a Change Politics account, we may also send you emails about actions you can take, such as asking a question to a candidate or making an endorsement, and notifications about your activities and the activities of those you follow (for example, trending questions, candidate responses, upcoming town halls, and messages from candidates and organizations you follow).
We may also send you reminders around elections and in connection with other major political events.
We use your information to allow you to participate in events and similar promotions and to administer these activities.
==========
Some of these activities have additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and disclose information about you, so we suggest that you read these rules carefully.
We need information about your social media account and activities to facilitate social sharing functionality, such as sharing petitions or other content, through our platforms and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
We use your account information to allow you to send email messages to your email contacts through the Change.org platforms, such as to share a petition.
By using this feature, you guarantee that you have the right to use and provide us the names and email addresses you submit.
==========
We use information about your computer or device to ensure that our site, apps, and APIs function properly and are optimized for your computer or device.
If you are using one of our mobile applications, we use your device ID to recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings.
We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to measure and improve our services and develop features and functionalities on our sites, apps and APIs.
For example, if we see that people using a certain device use the platform the most, we might decide to build an app specifically for that device.
We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to improve the relevance of our marketing campaigns and those of our advertisers.
For example, if you signed a petition regarding the protection of animal rights, you may subsequently see sponsored campaigns from animal protection organizations.
We use IP Addresses for administration and security purposes, such as calculating usage levels of our sites, apps and API, helping diagnose server problems, and detecting fraud and spam behavior.
==========
We may use and share aggregated and anonymized information to better understand and serve our users or for optimization of our marketing and ad targeting efforts.
For example, we may compile statistics like the percentage of our users in a state or country who care about animal rights, or the age range of those users.
In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information (for example, we may combine your name with your geographical location or combine your name with information about your activities on our platforms ).
In such case the combined information will be treated by us as personally identifying information and protected accordingly.
==========
In some instances, we may combine information about you from your activities on the Change.org platform and on the Change Politics platform.
For example, we may personalize your experience on Change.org and send you petitions we think may interest you based on the issues you support or questions you post or upvote on the Change Politics platform.
Or we may display to you on Change.org an advertisement on behalf of a political party that you have endorsed on Change Politics.
==========
As described above, we may combine the information you submit to us with information about you from public records, publicly available databases, and third-party providers.
Who may receive your information
Here we outline when and how information can be shared – either by you via the platforms, or by us.
Organizations can pay to promote their campaigns (that’s what helps keep the platforms free to use), but we won’t share your contact details with them without your permission.
