Additional Regional Privacy Disclosures
11.1 Individuals within the European Economic Area (EEA)


Data Controller




If you reside in the EEA, Dianomi PLC will be the controller of your Personal Data provided to, collected by or for, or processed by Dianomi in connection with our Services.
Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data


If you are a customer, Site visitor, or user from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the [Personal Data] described above (also referred to in this Section 5.1 as “EEA Data”) will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).
Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
==========
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us at: privacy@dianomi.com


Your Rights to Your Information
You have the right to request that Dianomi (i) provide you with access to the Personal Data we hold about you, (ii) correct your Personal Data, (iii) Export your Personal Data, (iv) delete your Personal Data, and (v) cease or restrict processing of your Personal Data.
If you are a user and would like to understand what Personal Data and behavioural information Dianomi holds about you, specifically, and how you can exercise any of your rights with respect to your Personal Data, please contact us at: privacy@dianomi.com.
You may also submit a data subject access request by emailing us at privacy@dianomi.com so that Dianomi may either respond with the relevant information.
==========
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data.
To learn more, please contact your local data protection authority.
However, if you have any questions about our collection and use of your Personal Data, please first contact us at: privacy@dianomi.com.
==========
EEA Data Transfers
We share your personal data within the Dianomi Group.
This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and Dianomi has in place an Inter Group Data Transfer Agreement across its international entities, which is based on the European Commission’s approved Standard Contractual Clauses, which are contractual privacy and security commitments between companies that transfer personal data.
We may also share your personal data with our external data partners who may be based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA, and such transfers will rely on adequacy determinations and/or be based on the European Commission’s approved Standard Contractual Clauses.
11.2.
==========
Individuals in the State of California
California law requires us to disclose the categories of personal information we collect and how we use them, the categories of sources from which we collect personal information, and the third parties with whom we share personal information, which we have explained in this Privacy Notice.
You also have the right to request what information we collect and how we use and disclose it.
Additionally, you have the right to access and delete your personal information.
==========
Please note that we must take steps to verify your identity before we can fulfil any consumer request.

==========
In addition, we are required to provide you with certain information about the business and commercial purposes for which we collect and share your personal information.
We use and disclose the information we collect for the business purposes described in the how we use your Information section of this policy, including: to allow our clients to select and display advertisements, to understand how users interact with our Services, for auditing purposes, to detect security incidents, to prevent fraud, debug, and repair errors, and for other purposes described above.

Civ.
Code § 1798.100-§ 1798.198).
