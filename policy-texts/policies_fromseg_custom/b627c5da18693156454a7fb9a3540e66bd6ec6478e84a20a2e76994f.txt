Cookies 
        We use "cookies"  (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain pages of the Site to help  analyze our web page flow, customize our services, measure promotional  effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.
We use cookies to provide services to you.
A few important things you should know about cookies are  that: 

We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.
Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted  from your hard drive at the end of a session.

You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Site.

You to enter your password less frequently during your use of our Site.
Us to provide information that is targeted to your interests.

Account Protection 
        Your password is the key to your account.
Use unique numbers, letters, and special  characters and do not disclose your Demandbase password to anyone.
If you do share your password or your  personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all  actions taken in the name of your account.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control  over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions  taken on your behalf.
Therefore, if your  password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us  and change your password.
==========
Accessing,  Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information 
        You can see, review and change most of your personal  information by logging into the Site.
Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because  it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely.
You must promptly update your personal  information if it changes or is inaccurate.
Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal  information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account  activity and in accordance with applicable law.
We do retain personal information from closed accounts in order to  comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,  troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User  Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
Security 
        Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States.
We treat data as an asset that must be  protected and use certain tools (encryption, passwords, physical security,  etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and  disclosure.
==========
However, as you probably  know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private  communications.
Therefore, although we  work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not  expect, that your personal information or private communications will always  remain private.
Phishing
        In order to protect yourself from email that appears to be  from Demandbase, but may be from a disreputable third party, you should never  provide any personal information directly in response to an email you believe  you have received from us.
Rather, you  should always close any such email, open your browser, log directly in to the  Demandbase Site and change, update or modify any such personal information only  using our Site.
In the event that you  believe that you have received a request for personal information in an email  message that is made to appear that it was sent by us, please inform us  immediately.
General 
        We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the  amended terms on the Site.
All amended  terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the  Site.
