A culture of accountability is essential to succeed in a data-driven world, made more complicated by increasingly advanced uses of data, and is the only path to driving business value long-term.
How We Operate
Our world-class data ethics program ensures we operate in compliance with jurisdictional laws, co-regulation developed by industry self-regulatory groups, and our own rigorous standards for ethical practices.
==========
Our Commitment
Through the application of data ethics, we are committed to diligently working to detect and prevent uses which are neither just or fair, and ensure that permitted uses of data create value for all stakeholders.
Evaluating Data Ethics Case by Case
Our data governance program assesses the impact of data use and interrogates and controls risk at each phase of innovation, production, delivery, and service.
We also consider the potential complications of increasingly advanced uses of data to ensure future preparedness.
