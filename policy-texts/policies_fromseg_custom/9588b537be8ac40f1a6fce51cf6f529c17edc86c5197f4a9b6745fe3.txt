You should be able to decide who sees your personal info.
Not just among your friends, but with every advertiser and company on the internet — including us.
==========
That’s why everything we make and do honors our Personal Data Promise
Take Less
We make a point of knowing less about you
All tech companies collect data to improve their products.
But it doesn’t need to include so much of your personal info.
The only data we want is the data that serves you in the end.
==========
We ask ourselves: do we actually need this?
What do we need it for?
And when can we delete it?
==========
Keep it safe
We do the hard work to protect your personal info
Data security is complicated — or at least it should be.
Which is why we take the extra steps to classify the data we have, maintain rules for how we store and protect each type, and never stop iterating on our processes.
==========
We prioritize your privacy.
We invest in it.
We’re committed to it.
We even teach other companies how to do it.
==========
No secrets
You’ll always know where you stand with us
There’s no hidden agenda here.
Our business doesn’t depend on secretly abusing your trust.
Our Privacy Notice is actually readable.
Anyone in the world can attend our weekly company meetings.
If you want to dig into every datapoint we collect, our code is open.
And so are we.
Why trust Firefox?
Because we put people first.
