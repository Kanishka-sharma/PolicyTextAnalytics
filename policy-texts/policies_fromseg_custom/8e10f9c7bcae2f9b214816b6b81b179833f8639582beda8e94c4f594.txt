Our Services
At StackAdapt, in accordance with the privacy policies of the websites we work with, we collect Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser information, recent search history, and activity on various websites in order to display effective native and video advertisements.
Native advertisements are advertisements that are integrated into the content of a given platform, such as a website.
Based on the behaviour and preferences of the users, we seek to group them into certain categories and display the most relevant advertisements to the users in those categories.
==========
We strictly follow the privacy policy of the website or other platforms we interact with.
For example, we would never collect data from a website user who has opted out of cookies.

Our Method
We use "pixel tags" and/or "cookies".
Pixel tags are small bits of code that provide a method of delivery information on a webpage which allows the operator of the page or a third party to collect the IP address of the users of the page.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on the browser of a computer that uniquely identify the browser and provide information to the cookie sender.
Many websites send cookies to the browsers that are visiting those sites, and many browsers are initially configured to accept cookies.
Users can change the browser settings to refuse cookies or to alert them when a cookie has been placed on their browser.
The user can check the browser for details in this regard.
Use of Data
We use the data we collect in order to display advertisements that we believe may be relevant to the user.
In seeking to identify relevant advertisements, we use this data to create and refine user segments, to develop and refine algorithms, and to understand better how users' interaction with a website might be of interest to advertisers.
==========
Data Security, Storage and Retention
We employ all reasonable industry standard measures to protect against the unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or destruction of the information we collect and our levels of safeguards correspond to the level of sensitivity of the information.
While we are committed to ensuring the security of the information, no protection measure can provide a 100% guarantee of security.
Consequently, we do not warrant or guarantee the security of the information.

Sharing Data
We share data with advertisers, partners, vendors, service providers and other trusted third parties.
When we share data with a third party, we have agreements with them for their use of our services on the StackAdapt Platform.
These agreements include clauses that hold our partners to the same high level of privacy protection we apply to the data and to never use the data for any other purpose than what we have committed to.
We may share information with our business and promotional partners to send you information, by email, telephone or other means, about products and services you may like.
Users may opt-out of receiving communications at any time.
Disclosure
We never disclose any personal data unless we are required by law and we would only do so having verified the lawful authority of the request, such as to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us and to defend against legal claims.
