Free online encrypted notepad keeps it simple
The biggest knock on the encryption offered by many cloud storage services is that the company itself can decrypt the data.
The free ProtectedText encrypted online notepad claims it can't decrypt the text you save on its servers.
In addition, ProtectedText requires no registration, and the company promises not to track you.
Nor does it display any ads, which do their own tracking.
Lack of a business model aside, the new service appears to have a lot going for it.
You devise the text file's URL: protectedtext.com/[anyURLnotalreadytaken].

How to opt out of some targeted Google ads
Google might be the king of online ads, but it still gives you a way to limit how some of your data is used to sell you things you don't need.
With its new Shared Endorsements coming on November 11, Google will make the ads you see more personalized by referencing your Google+ username, profile photo, and implied endorsements via comments and +1s.
Short of an ad-blocker, there's not much you can do to avoid ads completely.
But Google does provide a few controls for restricting how much of your online behavior shows up in ads.

How to deal with the new Facebook search settings
This week Facebook has reminded us it's putting an end to the ability to hide your profile from its Graph Search.
In the past, users were given the choice to allow other users to search for their profile by name on Facebook, or to hide their profile from the search.
For those of you who are still using this feature, you'll see reminders over the next few weeks as the setting is removed from the service altogether.

Enhance privacy by being deliberately inaccurate
When I go to the local sandwich shop, I don't care whether the person taking my order knows my birthday or my mother's maiden name.
So why does Google or some other Web site I register with need to know so much about me?
==========
Especially considering the company is likely to barter and sell the information to third parties, who aggregate, analyze, repackage, and resell it.
There's nothing new about purposely providing false information when registering for a Web service -- from a simple throwaway e-mail address all the way to a phony name.

How to set up two-step verification for Evernote
Two months after introducing two-factor verification to its Premium account users, Evernote has made it available for all users.
With this security feature enabled, you will need to enter your password along with a verification code sent to your mobile phone in order to log in to your account.
==========
What this means is that if someone gets a hold of your Evernote password, this nefarious individual would also need to be in possession of your phone to access your data.
To enable two-factor verification, log on to your account and go to Evernote's Security section.

Secure your Facebook account in six easy steps
Facebook wants its customers to share, and the company is very good at convincing users to make their private Facebook information available to the public.
According to a study published last year by Carnegie Mellon University researchers, changes in December 2009 to Facebook's privacy controls, and the introduction of Community Pages and Connected Profiles the following April very likely caused users to share more.
This reversed a four-year trend (2005 to 2009) of Facebook users tightening their privacy settings to share less, as Bianca Bosker described on the Huffington Post last March.
Facebook's recent proposal to change its … Read more
Find out (some of) what one big data broker knows about you
At least one big-name data broker thinks I'm an Asian who owns a cat and a boat and loves to travel.
Sounds like someone who leads a much more interesting life than I do.
That's the profile Acxiom revealed when I plugged my name, address, and other information into the data broker's free AboutTheData.com service.
The beta of the service was released last week.
Mine is one of hundreds of millions of profiles Acxiom sells to advertisers and other public and private organizations, which explains all those yachting ads I'm being served up.

How to opt out of Google's new personalized search results
Google recently added new voice recognition capabilities to its Search applications on Android, iOS, and within the Chrome browser.
The update includes similar features to those found in Google Now, such as the ability to track flights, search for photos you have taken, check reservations, and track recent purchases with a simple voice command.
In a blog post on Wednesday, Google revealed that it pulls the information directly from a user's Gmail, Calendar, and Google+ accounts.
Although the data is sent through an encrypted connection and only visible to you, some people may not be comfortable with Google going … Read more
Use URL Uncover to check if a shortened link is safe
There is no shortage of Web services to help you verify that a shortened link is legit and not something that's going to load you up with malware or steal personal information.

But when it comes to online privacy, it's always good to have options.
Instead of adding a "+" to the end of a bit.ly link, or using Unshorten.it, give URL Uncover a look the next time you get suspicious.
Addictive Tips recently wrote about URL Uncover, which will let you enter a shortened URL from over 100 different shortening services.
