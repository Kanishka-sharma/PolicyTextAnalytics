Cookies
The Register site sets cookies in order to help with the management of it's advertising.
The data is used by our Advertising Server, purely to help decide which adverts to display on the page, and for no other purpose beyond this.
You may of course choose to block these cookies if you wish, and the site will continue to function normally.
IP Addresses and Server Logs

This information is used solely for monitoring the volume of traffic the site receives and measuring the number of readers.
We do not use the information for tracking the activities of specific visitors to the site.

Advertising
The Register contains links to many third-party Web sites and displays advertisements from third-parties through third-party advertisement servers.
Current Register advertising server partners include DoubleClick.
DoubleClick's privacy policy stresses that it does not use any information gathered through its cookies for its own use.
Such data as it makes available to us is not used beyond the collation of broad calculations to measure the size of our readership.
Concerned users can opt out of its cookie system here.
If you encounter any problems with the advertising please contact: Philip Mitchell.
