Additional details

==========
Our processing (i.e. use) of your Personal Data is justified on the following legal bases:

Performance of Contract: the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you or
    take steps to enter into a contract at your request;
Compliance with Law: the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal
    obligation (for example, laws which require us to collect tax information from customers, carry out checks on
    customers, or which compel us to disclose information to public authorities or regulators);
Our Legitimate Interests: the processing is in our legitimate interests, subject to your
    interests and fundamental rights, and notably our legitimate interest in using applicable data to conduct and
    develop our business activities, such as developing and maintaining relationships with our customers (the
    majority of the processing covered by this Privacy Notice is legitimate interest based);*
Defend Our Rights: where the processing is necessary to the establishment, exercise or
    defense of legal claims; or
With Your Consent: you have consented to the processing (for example, where we are
    required by local law to rely upon your prior consent for the purposes of direct marketing).
* In all cases where legitimate interests is relied upon as a lawful basis, we take steps to ensure that our
legitimate interests are not outweighed by any prejudice to your rights and freedoms.
This is achieved in a number
of ways, including the application of principles of data minimization and security, and by taking steps to ensure
that Personal Data is collected where it is relevant to the lawful business activities, and, where using Personal
Data, is reasonably necessary for those activities.

==========
International Transfers of Personal Data 
Transfers outside of the EU.
If Personal Data is transferred outside the EU to other SolarWinds group
companies or to third-party service providers, we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data receives the
same level of protection as if it remained within the EU.
This includes entering into data transfer
agreements, using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification
schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield.
For transfers to other SolarWinds group companies in the United States
(a country that has not received a decision from the European Commission determining that the United States provides
adequate protection to Personal Data), we have put in place European Commission approved Standard Contractual
Clauses, which protect Personal Data transferred between SolarWinds entities.
You have a right to obtain details of
the mechanism under which your Personal Data is transferred outside of the EU by contacting privacy@solarwinds.com.
We contractually require agents, service providers, and affiliates who may process Personal Data related to the
Services to provide the same level of protections for Personal Data as required under the Principles.
SolarWinds
currently does not transfer Personal Data to a third party for the third party’s own use, but only for
SolarWinds’ purposes as outlined above.
==========
SolarWinds will remain liable under the Principles if one of its
third-party processors processes Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, if we are responsible
for the event giving rise to the damage.
Vendor Data Protection Requirements.
SolarWinds recognizes that the use of third party vendors must be
properly managed.
Before entering into third party relationships, we take deliberate steps to conduct an assessment
of risk related to the vendor relationship.
We take care to understand the compliance, reputational, strategic,
operational, and transactional risks relating to a particular vendor before entering into a contractual
relationship.
==========
Any vendor who has access to Personal Data is expected to demonstrate their security policies, processes, and
procedures and prove that they are able to provide adequate protection of such data, including against misuse or
compromise.

The Sites, Services and portal are not for use by children under the age of 16 years and SolarWinds does not
knowingly collect, store, share or use the Personal Data of children under 16 years.

16 years and you have provided Personal Data, please ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) to notify SolarWinds, and

a statute of limitations, so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints
or challenges.
