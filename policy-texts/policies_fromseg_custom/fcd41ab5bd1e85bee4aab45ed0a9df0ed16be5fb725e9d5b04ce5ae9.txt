Whom Do We Share the Collected Information With?
First and foremost, you should know that Padlet does not sell or rent your personal information to any third-party for any purpose.
We share information we collect from you under the limited circumstances set forth below: Information Shared With the Public Through the Service All registered users have a public profile (e.g. https://padlet.com/doodlebug).
The profile has the user’s profile photo, name, username, bio, and their public padlets.
These profiles are accessible to and searchable by all Padlet users.
These profiles may also be indexed by search engines like Google and Bing.
==========
Any content you post on a public padlet is also indexable by search engines and, as such, is open to the public.
Information Shared With Other Padlet Users Through the Service When you collaborate with other people, they can see your profile photo, name, and username.
Information Shared With Service Providers in Order to Operate and Improve the Services We work with many vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf.
These service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions.
==========
E.g.: We use Front to manage customer support requests.
We share your name, your email, and your messages with them.
==========
We use Sentry to notify us when a user encounters an error so we can fix it promptly.
We share your device information with them.
==========
We use Chargebee to manage billing.
They store your name, email, and credit card information.
==========
These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Policy.
Padlet has also entered into Data Processing Agreements with parties who process data on our behalf or in connection with the use of the Padlet Service.
Information Shared with Third Parties We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other de-identified or non-personally identifiable information, with users, partners, press, or other third-parties in order to, for example, demonstrate how Padlet is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for Padlet.
Any aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any personal information.
==========
Information Disclosed to Fulfil Legal Obligations We may disclose personal information if necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process.
We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Padlet, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.
This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to law enforcement and government requests.
==========
Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Padlet, or its users.
In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.
==========
Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers Over time, Padlet may grow and reorganize.
We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Policy.
In the event that all or a portion of Padlet or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party.
This Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).
==========
We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within 30 days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by emailing you on your email address on file.
If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.
==========
In the unlikely event that Padlet goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third-party.
Information Shared to Enforce Content Policy To make sure that all content on Padlet conforms to our content policy, we run all user content, no matter the privacy, through a series of automated checks.
If any content is flagged to be in violation of our content policy, an authorized personnel at Padlet may look at it to determine the appropriate action to be taken against that content.
==========
This helps us keep the Service safe and appropriate for all users.
Information You Share with Third Party Services You may access Third Party Services through the Service, for example by watching a YouTube video on a padlet.
You may also choose to share information that you provide to us with Third Party Services (e.g., by posting your padlet to Twitter or Facebook).
==========
These services have their own privacy policies which we don’t govern.
We encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information.
Information Shared With Your Consent or at Your Request Other than the cases above, we will share your information only if we have your consent.
