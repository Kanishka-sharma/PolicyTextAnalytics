Key Definitions
In this Privacy Policy, we use the following key definitions.
Other terms are defined in the body of the policy.
==========
“Clickstream Data” means the information that TechTarget collects through cookies, log files, beacons and clear GIFs, as described in Section 4 below.
“Content Provider” means a third party that owns a white paper, analyst report or other document and allows TechTarget to link to or display that document on the Sites.
“User” or “you” means any person viewing any page of the Sites.
==========
“Third Party Content” means the white papers, analyst reports and other documents available through the Sites and owned by Content Providers.
This Privacy Policy Does Not Apply To Third Party and Co-Branded Websites
Bitpipe.com is one of the properties within the TechTarget network of sites.
Bitpipe.com hosts thousands of white papers as well as white paper Research Libraries on third party sites and other TechTarget properties.
Some Third Party Content made available through the Research Library sites is maintained on the website of the Content Provider, and not on the TechTarget network of sites.
This means that when you click through to that Third Party Content, you will be leaving the Research Library and the TechTarget network.
It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to a website in TechTarget network of sites.
==========
This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information you choose to disclose to the Content Provider on the Content Provider site.
In addition, the Sites you are viewing may be co-branded, meaning that the Sites are branded with the logos of both Bitpipe and a third party (“Co-Branded Sites”).
If you register or log in on a Co-Branded Site, you are choosing to disclose information to both TechTarget and the third party with whose brand the site is co-branded.
This Privacy Policy only governs TechTarget’s use of your information.
The third party’s use of that personal information is governed by the partner's privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy.
==========
What Information Do We Collect?
Profile Information: Our primary goal in collecting profile information (which may include your name and the following business – and not home or personal – information: title, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address) is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities to obtain other products and services from us and our partners.
Because we derive revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users.
We collect profile information when you provide it to us through the following: when you register on one of our sites, subscribe to a print magazine or an e-mail newsletter, register for one of our events or register to use certain services (like webcasts and white papers) or through surveys.
==========
Several of the services that we offer on our sites may require registration as a condition of use.
Once you register with one of the TechTarget network of sites, including Bitpipe and The ServerSide.com Community sites, you are no longer anonymous to us.
We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as Dunn and Bradstreet, and add it to the information you provided to us.
==========
Cookies: When you view the Sites, a small file called a cookie is placed on your hard drive.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
(However, by not accepting cookies, some of our web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.)
==========
If you register as a member of TechTarget by providing your name, email address and other contact details (a “Member”), TechTarget will use cookies to authenticate your identity when you visit the Sites and to personalize your user experience, such as by displaying your username when you log on.
In all cases, TechTarget uses cookies to obtain anonymous information such as the number of visits to the Sites that a certain user has made, the movement of the user through the Sites, and the searches that the user conducts on the Sites.
Clear GIFs & Servers: We use electronic images known as "clear GIFs" -- sometimes called "transparent GIFs", "Web bugs", “pixel tags” or "beacons" -- that allow us to track general user traffic patterns (and not personally identifiable information).
==========
TechTarget also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested (though these automatic updates do not include your name or other profile information).
Subscriber Information: If you subscribe to an email newsletter and become a “Subscriber”, TechTarget collects your email address, password and area of interest.
Member Information: If you register as a Member (such as by registering on a search site, subscribing to a newsletter, signing up for My Bitpipe or Library Membership or to access a LeadIQ document), TechTarget collects additional information, including your name and corporate title, the name of your company and the department in which you work, your industry group, country, zip code and telephone number (“Member Details”).
At the time you register to become a Member, or later when you access a particular page or document, TechTarget may collect additional information, including but not limited to: information about software or hardware your company is using, plans your company may have to purchase additional information technology, etc..
All of this information together is included in the definition of “Member Details”.
Event Registration Information: When registering to attend a TechTarget event, the registration form requires users to provide information such as name and corporate title, company name, address, telephone and email address.
TechTarget may also collect additional information, including but not limited to: information about software or hardware your company is using, plans your company may have to purchase additional information technology, etc.
==========
LeadIQ Document Information: Some of the content found at the Sites or delivered to users by email consists of interactive documents known as “LeadIQ Documents”.
All LeadIQ Documents are clearly labeled as such.
Before you access a LeadIQ Document, you are asked to register as a Member and provide Member Details as indicated above.
In addition, TechTarget tracks certain aspects of your use of the LeadIQ Document, such as when you open the document, print the document, which pages of the document are viewed, the time spent viewing them, information about your computer such as host name and IP address.
This “LeadIQ Activity Data” is stored in a temporary file on your hard drive and also communicated to TechTarget.
==========
Third Party Personal Information: The Sites include an “email a friend” feature, which allows a user to email an article to a third party.
The email addresses of third parties to whom such articles or documents are emailed are the only third party personal information collected at the Sites.
Supplementary Information: TechTarget may supplement Member Details with publicly available information about a Member’s company.
For example, if a Member indicates she works for X Company, we may obtain information showing that X Company has a certain number of employees and a certain estimated annual turnover.
==========
This information is called “Supplementary Information”.
System Information: TechTarget’s webcast application provides a system test that determines whether you can view a webcast from your computer.
This information is used to optimize the viewing experience and to troubleshoot webcast viewing problems.
We do not collect or retain personally identifiable information in conducting these tests.
==========
Transaction Information: When you order paid Third Party Content from the Sites, we ask you to complete an order form that requests certain information from you, including a credit card number and expiration date and general contact details.
Sharing Information: We aggregate profile information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes.
Except for the specific instances of information-sharing described above, we do not disclose to third parties any information that could be used to identify you personally.
Aggregated user statistics (for example, 25% of our users are interested in Networking) are collected in order to describe our services to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
