What information does Webshots gather/track and how is it used?Use of traffic dataEach time a visitor comes to the Webshots 
                website, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience.
We collect the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from cnet.com or ucsd.edu), their IP address (a unique number 
                that identifies a computer), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a Webshots website), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh 
                platform).
In addition to collecting these types of information, Webshots collects visitor information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising.
We also count, track, and aggregate the 
                visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within Webshots, etc).
To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which 
                may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but Webshots will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission.
When Webshots does present aggregated information to outside 
                companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.Use of cookies Webshots websites use cookies for internal reporting.

                code, we can do some basic customization (such as horoscopes and weather) and as a check in case you forget your "Password."

                general statistics for our internal usage and for advertising purposes.2.

                organizations whose products or services Webshots thinks he or she might find interesting, users can choose the appropriate option when registering for newsletters, sweepstakes, contests, or other events that Webshots sponsors.
