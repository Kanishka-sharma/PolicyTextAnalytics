Updated, November 18, 2016.
Overview
Madison Logic, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Madison Logic”, or “we”, “us”, “our”) respect your privacy.
This Privacy Policy details the information we may collect through registration forms, resource libraries, advertising units, widgets, web sites and web pages, whether accessed via computer, mobile or tablet device, or other technology (collectively, the “Platform”), collection and licensing of data through third parties we work with, and how such information may be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it, and your choices in controlling its use in connection with our marketing activities.
Data Collection
Our purpose in collecting information is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions, or other relevant content delivered through targeted advertising.
We will not willfully disclose any identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your explicit permission, as explained in this privacy statement.
We collect the following information that identifies you: your name, address, email address, and telephone number (“Personal Information”) when you choose to provide it to us for example, by submitting a registration form in order to access free content.
==========
We may also receive this information when you provide it to a business partner of ours.
We may receive business profile information about you, such as your industry, company size and job title from other sources, and add it to the information we hold about you.
This helps us to promote content that is relevant to you and as described below.
If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.
Madison Logic stores Personal Information in a separate database from any Usage Information.
The madisonlogic.com website may also collect another recipient’s email address to help you to initiate and email the recipient you have selected, when you forward a position to them in our careers pages.
The recipient may contact us at privacy@madisonlogic.com to request that we remove this information.
==========
How We Use the Information We Collect
Madison Logic may use the information we obtain, license and collect about and from you for a number of business purposes, including for example, to: better tailor website and promotional content to visitor interests; verify your profile information; deliver targeted advertising; inform our partners and Clients of your business-related interests; improve the Platform for internal business purposes; help our advertising partners and Clients better understand the audience they are reaching; and for purposes we disclose at the time you provide your Personal Information.
Cookies / Tracking Technologies
We Madison Logic and our publishing partners, Clients, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer websites, track users’ movements around websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
==========
As to information submitted to, through or on our website, we may likewise use service providers to host content, host or implement blogs and forums, or conduct data and marketing analytics with respect to information captured.
Madison Logic may use a variety of technologies, including “cookies” that automatically or passively collect information from your computer, mobile device or other technology when you are visiting a Madison Logic or partner or Client website or on a 3rd party’s behalf when we serve advertisements and store it in log files.
Information collected may include data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, your responses to advertisements delivered by us, date and time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests (“Usage Information”).
This information may be associated with anonymous business profile information about you, such as your industry, company size, and job title.
The purpose of this information is to keep the Platform updated and interesting to our users and tailor content to each individual’s interests.
==========
Madison Logic does not use this information to discern your identity or to disclose your identity to any 3rd party.
You may click here to opt out of certain cookie-based ad targeting facilitated by Madison Logic current partners.
This link will take you to the NAI’s industry opt-out page where you will be able to opt-out from Interest-Based Advertising from Madison Logic and other NAI members.
Please note: This opt-out relies on a cookie, so if you wipe all your cookies, we will no longer know that you have opted out.
==========
A cookie is a small file stored on a user’s device containing information about the user.
We may use cookies to reduce or pre-populate registration fields so that you can receive free content more easily, deliver targeted advertising, or understand your interests and focus areas of research.
We believe this enables us to provide users with a more meaningful online experience.
We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash to store content information and preferences.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
==========
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information.

Advertising / Behavioral Targeting; How to Opt-Out
If you wish to opt out of certain cookie-based ad targeting facilitated by current partners of our Platform, please visit this opt-out page.
We may use third party vendors to enhance the Platform (e.g. for purposes of retargeting).
We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but they may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device and they may otherwise collect or have access to anonymous Usage Information.
When you use the opt-out mechanism above, Madison Logic will no longer use or share any of your Personal or anonymous Usage Information, unless you recently submitted Personal Information (within last 30 days) in order to access free content, in which case only the Content Provider associated with the content you recently acquired will have access to your information.
When you opt out of the Platform, we place a cookie on or otherwise identify your browser or device (and/or employ similar technology) to prevent future collection of Usage Information.
Opting out of the Platform is not the same as blocking cookies.
When you opt out of Madison Logic’s Platform, we will place a special Madison Logic cookie on (or otherwise identify) your device or browser in a way that informs our systems not to record information related to your business research activities.
If you browse the web from multiple devices or browsers, you will need to opt out from each device or browser to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them.
For the same reason, if you procure a new device, change browsers or delete the Madison Logic opt out cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out task again.
Disabling Cookies
If you would prefer not to accept certain cookies, you may be able to do the following, with your browser:

change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or
set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies

However, not all browsers offer these features for all types of cookies, and we cannot promise that this technique will work.
Please also note that cookies are used for a variety of reasons, not just marketing-related, so this may adversely impact your online experience.
==========
Sharing of Information
Except as denoted in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any partners or other third parties without your consent.
We may share Personal Information and Usage information with Clients.
We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregated demographics, user statistics, interest categories, and Usage Information with third parties.
We may combine your Usage Information with those of other users of the Platforrm in order to share trend information with third parties, always in aggregated and anonymous form.
We may aggregate Usage Information associated with your Personal Information into business-related research events, which include the form of engagement and content type, topics derived from the content of the event, and date/timestamp of when the event occurred, always in anonymous form.
An interest event may be, for example, the downloading of a whitepaper on cloud computing, or clicking on an advertisement related to SSL certificates.
We may share any type of information with companies that assist us in operating our business or providing our services such as our blog and career pages.
==========
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
