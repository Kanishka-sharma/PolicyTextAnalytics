Web Beacon - Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF.
Used in 
                                                combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, 
                                                usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or in an 
                                                e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or 
                                                sending the e-mail.
When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to 
                                                retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the 
                                                IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was 
                                                viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and 
                                                previously set cookie values.
Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of 
                                                a site.
==========
A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page 
                                                and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of 
                                                the site.
Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from 
                                                tracking the user's activity.
The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous 
                                                visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.

  - (Top)


                                                At DAI, children’s privacy is important to us.
Therefore, we take additional 
                                                measures to help children protect their privacy while online including not 
                                                asking them to disclose more personally identifiable information than is 
                                                necessary for them to participate in an activity and encouraging them to use 
                                                non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names.
DAI is dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal 
                                                information we obtain from you with care and respect.
This Children's Privacy 
                                                Statement is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies 
                                                and principles with respect to children under the age of 13.
DAI recognizes the 
                                                need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit our website 
                                                at www.subway.com.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform 
                                                parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal 
                                                information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent 
                                                of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use 
                                                certain features of our website.
Also, when we use the term "parent", we mean to 
                                                include legal guardians.
Children can participate in many of our features without providing personally 
                                                identifiable information.
However, to enable their participation in certain of 
                                                our interactive features, we may ask children to provide us with personally 
                                                identifiable information.
The types of information we may request include first 
                                                name as well as the child’s and parent’s email addresses.
We use a child’s email 
                                                address to respond to a specific request to participate in an activity (e.g., 
                                                participate in a contest or sweepstakes, respond to their question, enable them 
                                                to subscribe to a newsletter).
We use parents’ e-mail addresses to obtain their 
                                                consent or notify them of their child's online activities and enable the parent 
                                                to unsubscribe the child from a newsletter or other similar activity.
We 
                                                do not share children's personally identifiable information with outside third 
                                                parties not bound by this Privacy Policy.
==========
Sometimes, we use agents or 
                                                contractors to help us conduct a contest or sweepstakes, send prizes to winners, 
                                                or provide customer service related to activities on the site.
In these cases, 
                                                we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to 
                                                use it only for the specific services they are performing.

                                                any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information 
                                                from their child and can request that any personal information we have collected 
                                                be deleted from our records.
We 
                                                will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we 
                                                intend to collect, use, and/or share their child’s personal information.
Please 
                                                note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to 
                                                provide us a current email address.
If you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have 
                                                collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request 
                                                that there be no further collection or use of your child's information, or if

                                                prospective franchisee’s ability to become a franchisee.
Once a prospective 
                                                SUBWAY® restaurant franchisee becomes a franchisee, they may then reference 
                                                themselves by their Franchise Agreement Number.
In order to better service 
                                                franchisees, a franchisee’s Personal Information may be shared between DAI and 
                                                its affiliates within the SUBWAY® Group, pursuant to the service contracts 
                                                between them.
In order to effectively implement the SUBWAY® Gift Card 
                                                Program, and to provide purchasing services to members, a franchisee’s Personal 
                                                Information may be shared with an independent purchasing cooperative or other 
                                                independent third party.
The Personal Information shared with the independent 
                                                purchasing cooperative shall include, but will not be limited to: name, address, 
                                                credit card information, and other related information necessary for billing 
                                                purposes, such as a mailing address for credit card validation, and bank account 
                                                information, you provided to DAI to establish your pre-authorized account for 
                                                the payment of royalties, advertising fees, and other charges.
Subject to a 
                                                franchisee’s agreement with the independent purchasing cooperative, the 
                                                independent purchasing cooperative may bill a franchisee’s bank account for fees 
                                                and other costs associated with the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program.
If a franchisee 
                                                does not wish to disclose this information, they must notify the Privacy Officer
