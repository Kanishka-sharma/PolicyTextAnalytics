Information Collection Technologies

Our use of cookies: ART19 uses a technology that is commonly known as "cookies."
A cookie is a file our server writes to your hard drive that contains an alphanumeric identifier.
We use the identifier in a cookie to help us manage and report on your interaction with the Service.
==========
Through cookies, we are able to collect information that we use to improve the Service, keep count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, authenticate your login credentials, or manage multiple instances of the Service in a single browser.
We may also collect other data such as the page or site that referred you to the Service, the date and time you visited the Service, and your current IP address.
==========
The cookies we place on your hard drive are known as "first-party cookies."
We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
A session cookie expires when you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You may be able to remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your browser's "help" section.
If you do not accept first-party cookies you may still use our Service, but your ability to use some areas of our website, and the ability to stay logged in, will be limited.
==========
Advertisers' and other third parties' use of cookies: Advertisers and third-party advertising partners that deliver ads to you on the Service may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive.
These types of non-ART19 cookies are known as "third-party cookies."
==========
Advertisers and third-party advertising partners may use third-party cookies in order to collect information about you, which may include how many times you have seen their ads or whether you have interacted with an ad.
They may also use third-party cookies to provide you with interest-based advertising.
Most major web browsers provide users with the option to accept or reject third-party cookies.
The use of third-party cookies is not covered by this privacy policy.
We do not have access to or control over cookies placed by advertisers and other third parties.
==========
HTML5 Local Storage: ART19 and its advertising and technology partners may, in some instances, use HTML5 Local Storage (collectively, "Local Storage") to enhance your listening and advertising experiences on the Service.
For example, we use Local Storage to keep track of the current podcast playing in the event your browser window reloads inadvertently, that way we can continue playing that podcast starting at the same position it was prior to reload.
Our advertising and technology partners may use Local Storage to detect your bandwidth speeds for optimal video playback performance.
==========
Each browser implements HTML5 Local Storage differently and provides tools for managing content stored within local storage.
Review your browser's privacy settings to manage the content stored within HTML5 Local Storage.

For example, when you share information through integrated social networking platforms, such as Facebook, you are agreeing to allow the ART19 service to communicate or "talk" with the other service in order to make the social features available for your use.
These service partners may have their own data collection, use, and sharing practices that may also be applicable to your personal information, and that are not covered by this Policy.
You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those third-party service providers and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policies of the third-party service providers and the methods they use for changing the privacy or sharing settings on such services.
