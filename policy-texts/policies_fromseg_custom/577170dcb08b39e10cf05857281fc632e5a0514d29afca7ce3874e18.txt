The LKQD Advertising Platform
The LKQD Platform helps publishers and advertiser groups power their business by generating revenue from advertisements.
To help publishers and advertiser groups serve accurate and relevant ads, we collect and use a variety of information through our platform, which we describe below
3.
About Data Collected and Used by the LKQD Platform
We collect information about viewers of the advertisements that are made available through our platform.
The primary purpose for collecting this information is to enhance the likelihood that an advertisement seen by a viewer is relevant to the viewer.
We also use the data we collect to improve and analyze our service, create new services, and report performance metrics to our customers.
The information we collect is not intended to personally identify a specific viewer.
For example, we do not collect a viewer’s name, address, phone number, or account information.
==========
Instead, we collect information that indicates that a specific device tends to be used in ways that suggest certain types of advertisements would be relevant to the device’s user.
The data the LKQD Platform collects and uses includes, but is not limited to:
a.
The type of browser, hardware model, operating system, unique device identifiers, your Internet provider, and IP address.
b. Device IDs associated with a User’s mobile device.
This includes mobile advertising identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA and Android’s Advertising ID.
c. Information about websites, applications, and other content that you interact with, which may be tied to a unique identifier, and can include the date and time of your visit to a website, and the referring URL or mobile application name.
d. Web pages and advertisements you view.
e. Clickstream data.
f. Unique identifiers that we, or a partner of LKQD has associated with a User’s browser, through browser cookies, web beacons, or similar locally stored objects or code that can identify the physical location of mobile devices and operating system device identifiers.
g. Information about your interaction with video content, such as the type of content viewed.
h. Information or inferences about a user’s interests.
(collectively, “Services Data”)
In addition to data that we collect, we receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support.
The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by LKQD.
Additionally, we may associate user’s devices using probabilistic methodologies to accurately target and serve ads across devices.
Services Data does not include information that by itself, individually identifies an individual, such as your e-mail address, phone number, or name.
==========
For the purposes of EU data protection law, some Services Data such as an IP address, device ID and other data may be considered personal data.
LKQD does not however collect any "sensitive" or "special categories" as defined under EU data protection law.
LKQD is the controller of the personal information it collects from you.

==========
How We Collect Information?
When LKQD, or LKQD, on behalf of a client, purchases online advertisements on a website/application, and such individual interacts with such advertisement or visits the website/application, Services Data is collected on such website or application through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, and other similar technologies.
Once collected, the Services Data may be used by LKQD to target advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, and to deliver interest-based advertisements on behalf of LKQD’s clients.

How We Use the Data We Collect
The purpose for collecting this information is to enhance the likelihood that an advertisement seen by a viewer is relevant to the viewer.
We also use the data we collect to improve and analyze our service, create new services, and report performance metrics to our customers.
The information we collect is not intended to personally identify a specific viewer.
For example, we do not collect a viewer’s name, address, phone number, or account information.
Instead, we collect information that indicates that a specific device tends to be used in ways that suggest certain types of advertisements would be relevant to the device’s user.
We may use the data to create, or collect from LKQD partners, data segments associated with UIDs, cookies, or device advertising IDs.
Data Segments may be based on inferred interests or geo-graphic locations, such as those collected by mobile applications.
Cookies.
A cookie is a small text file created by a website and stored in a user’s web browser.
LKQD uses cookies to store data for: advertising and/or interest-based advertising purposes; delivery and reporting of advertisements; tracking users’ responses to an ad (e.g., click rate and conversions); reviewing the frequency and time of the display of an advertisement; storage of user preferences; and the collection, aggregation and analysis of anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior.
Further, to better serve relevant ads to you, we may also assign an identifier (“ID”) to your device, computer, or browser when serving an ad.
The ID may be implemented on your computer/device through a cookie.
Such method does not enable LKQD to personally identify you.
The ID can be used to attempt to match an assigned user by inference, based on the user’s activities tracked across multiple devices or browsers.
==========
Tags, Beacons, and Pixels.
Tags are computer codes incorporated into a HTML/JavaScript code of a web page and delivered to a web browser or application when the web page loads.
A beacon, web beacon, or a pixel is a transparent web image that can be placed on a web page.
Overall, LKQD utilizes tags, beacons, and/or pixels to set cookies, collect data, extend audiences between multiple marketing partners, and to serve more relevant ads.
Our third-party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may also use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of the information displayed or delivered over a website/application.

The legal basis for processing will depend on what data we are collecting and what we are using it for.
However, we will not use your personal data for the purpose of our legitimate interests when our interests are overridden by the impact on your data protection interests or fundamental rights or freedoms.
