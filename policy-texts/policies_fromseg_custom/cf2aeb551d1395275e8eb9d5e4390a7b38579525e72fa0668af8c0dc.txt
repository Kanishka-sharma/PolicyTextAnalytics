First Draft of Resource Timing Published
24 May 2011 | Archive
The Web Performance Working Group has published the First Public Working Draft of Resource Timing.
This specification defines an interface for web applications to access timing information related to HTML elements.
==========
User latency is an important quality benchmark for Web Applications.
While JavaScript-based mechanisms can provide comprehensive instrumentation for user latency measurements within an application, in many cases, they are unable to provide a complete end-to-end latency picture.
While the Navigation Timing specification address part of the problem by providing timing information associated with a navigation, this document introduces the ResourceTiming interface to allow Javascript mechanisms to collect complete timing information related to resources on a document.
