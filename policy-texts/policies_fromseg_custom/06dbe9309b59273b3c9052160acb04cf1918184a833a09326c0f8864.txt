Little League Internet Privacy Policy 

 The 
              Little League Baseball Internet Privacy Policy has been written 
              to answer questions you might have about online privacy.
As a youth 
              organization, we are very concerned about privacy and go to extraordinary 
              measures to safeguard any personal information we may collect about 
              you or your children.
==========
Advice to Children and Parents - 
              We strongly advise children to get their parent's or guardian's 
              permission before submitting any kind of personal data over the 
              Internet.
We urge parents to be very clear with their children regarding 
              the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in 
              person) they don't know.
We also encourage parents and guardians 
              to spend time online with their children and to participate in the 
              activities offered on the sites they visit.
==========
Parents and legal guardians have the opportunity to restrict Little 
              League Baseball’s access to any personal information collected 
              from children under the age of 13.
In addition, parents and legal 
              guardians have the right to request that any information currently 
              held by Little League Baseball that has been collected online about 
              their child or children be deleted.
==========
What personal information do we collect?
At Little League Baseball, we don't collect personal information 
              about you or your children online (name, address, e-mail, and so 
              on) unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.
The only 
              times we will ask for personal or contact information from you will 
              be:

to enable us to respond to your inquiry,
to register you for a contest, or 
to take your subscription for a Little League Baseball publication 
                that is being delivered electronically.
If you do not want your personal information collected, even for 
              these reasons, please do not submit it to us.
Do we disclose it?
Little League Baseball Incorporated does not sell, loan, exchange, 
              or make available in any way the names, addresses, or any other 
              contact or demographic information concerning our volunteers or 
              players.

              Incorporated.
No information collected on this website from children under 13 
              years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever,

In that case, 
              the information collected is used only for the specific contest 
              and is not saved in any form after the end of the contest.
Contests and Submissions
              We sometimes offer contests, games, and promotions; or invite you 
              to submit stories, comments, or questions to certain areas of our 
              site.
On these occasions, we may ask you to voluntarily submit your 
              e-mail address along with your contest entry or submission so that 
              we can notify you if you are a winner, or to respond to (or ask) 
              questions.
If you are under the age of 13 years, you must provide us 
                with your parent's or legal guardian's e-mail address and obtain 
                permission from your parent or legal guardian before collecting 
                your prize.
Your parent or guardian will then be notified that 
                you have entered a Little League Baseball contest.
We will send 
                them an e-mail message giving them an opportunity to limit your 
                participation, if they wish.
