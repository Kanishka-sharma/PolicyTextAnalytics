We may reach out to you in different ways, for example, to tell you about a new version of an application you’ve purchased, to show you how to use a particular feature we think you may enjoy, or to tell you about a new application.
However, we also let you tell us you’d rather not hear from us with this type of communication.
Adobe email, telephone, and postal mail marketing
If you agree to receive email, telephone, or postal mail marketing from us, we try to make it useful for you, based on your likely interests.
Please let us know if you’d rather not hear from us.
==========
If you are a business customer and agreed to receive Adobe marketing communications, we may share your information with our resellers and other sales partners.
Note that we do not share personal information about consumers with third parties for their own marketing purposes unless the consumer agreed to that sharing.

Advertising within Adobe websites and applications
When you are using an Adobe website or application, we may show you content, offers, or recommendations that are based on your likely interests.
Learn about your privacy choices related to content, offers, and recommendations tailored to your likely interests.
Adobe sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display ads to you based on your likely interests.
We may learn your likely interests when you use our websites and applications and from other companies and websites that help us understand your likely interests.
These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads” or “online behavioral advertising.”
We hire “ad networks” to display these Adobe ads on websites across the Internet.
The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests.
==========
We and our ad networks learn which Adobe ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page they were displayed.
We allow you to choose not to receive tailored Adobe ads shown on other websites based on your activity on our websites and online services.
If you tell us not to send you these types of ads, you may still see Adobe ads on other companies’ websites, but they will not be based on your activity on our websites and online services.
Choose your preferences for interest-based ads
For more general information about interest-based ads and your choices, visit these sites: the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Network Advertising Initiative, and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe.
Adobe websites do not currently respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals.
If a standard is developed for how such signals should be interpreted, Adobe will re-evaluate whether to respond to the signals.
==========
Adobe also runs other kinds of online ad campaigns on social networking websites and other non-Adobe websites and apps.
Some of these ads may be based on information we have about users (for example, customers who have an outdated version of Adobe Photoshop may see an ad for the latest version).
These ads may also be based on information the user provided to the website or app (for example, Chief Marketing Officers on LinkedIn may see an ad for Adobe web analytics services).
If Adobe provides information to a website or app for these advertising purposes, the information may only be used to display the Adobe ad.
==========
The website and app providers we hire to display these ads may set their own cookies on your browser, and may use web beacons and device identifiers (such as IP addresses) to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests.
Adobe and the website or app may learn which Adobe ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and where they were displayed.
Please see the privacy policy of the website or app where an Adobe ad is shown for more information about its privacy practices and privacy choices it may offer.
