Introduction: Marriott has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy.
We understand that visitors to our website may have questions about whether and how this website collects and uses information.
Accordingly, we have prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern Marriott.com (including marriotthotels.com, courtyard.com, residenceinn.com, fairfieldinn.com, conferencecenters.com, execapartments.com, execustay.com, towneplacesuites.com and springhillsuites.com)
Please note that a separate privacy statement and separate terms and conditions apply to the Marriott Rewards program (http://www.marriottrewards.com/rewards/terms/default.asp).
==========
Browsing: Visitors who browse this website do so on an anonymous basis.
We have not configured this website to collect any information from your computer without your input.
This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with information, we will not know your identity, your e-mail address, or any other information identifiable to you.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet.
When users request a page from our site, our servers log the userâ€™s current IP address.
We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems.
We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
==========
Thus, each user session is anonymous.
Cookies: Our website makes only limited use of "cookie" technology.
"Cookies" are strings of text that a website transmits to a user's computer.
Cookies enable a website to keep track of a user's preferences and activities relating to that website.
Our website creates a temporary cookie for each visit in order to facilitate your visit.
==========
For example, our cookies are used to "remember" the purchases of gift certificates that you place in the "shopping basket" for that visit, to customize the appearance of our website based on the hotel brand you initially sought to visit (i.e., based on the website address you initially typed in), or to prevent the same user from making repeated enrollments in our Marriott Rewards program                  (see http://www.marriottrewards.com/rewards/terms/default.asp for the specific terms and conditions and privacy statement that apply to that program).
Our cookies expire automatically after you leave our website.
These cookies transmit no information about you or your computer back to Marriott.
If you do not wish to receive these cookies, you may set your browser to reject the cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our website.
==========
Information: When we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.
For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card type, credit card number, expiration date and room preference (non-smoking room or no preference) to process your reservation.
We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the reservation.
The same type of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate transaction.
When we ask you for personal data when making a reservation or purchasing a gift certificate, including your name, address and credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.
==========
This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet.
This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer.
You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock icon in the lower right hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position.
==========
In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address with change from "http" to "https."
After information reaches Marriott it is stored on a secure server that resides behind a firewall that is designed to block access from outside the Company.
We may also ask you to fill out an online customer survey, to obtain your suggestions or comments about your use of Marriott services, or for similar purposes.
Providing this information is voluntary.
==========
We also, at times, may use an interactive dialogue product to assist visitors while on certain web pages.
The content of the dialogue is not identifiable to you unless you voluntarily provide us with your name or other information regarding your identity.
The dialogue product is used only to facilitate your visit by providing the additional information you request, and the content will not be stored and used by us except for quality assurance and statistical analysis purposes, so that we can better anticipate our prospective customers' needs.
==========
Marriott Use of Information: We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and strict corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information.
Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.
Information is generally processed and stored in the United States, in which data protection laws are not as comprehensive as in the European Union.
==========
The gift certificate, survey and other such non-reservations information is used only for the purpose for which the information was collected and is not used for direct marketing or shared with other companies.
The personal information you provide to us for making a reservation is made available to the applicable hotel for the purpose of meeting your reservation request.
If you cancel your reservation, the information is stored for recordkeeping purposes only and is not accessed again.
After completing your stay at a Marriott hotel, the information you provide may be used for direct marketing by a Marriott hotel or a Marriott company.
Marriott may use the services of a third party mail house for the sole purpose of mailing materials.
Disclosure of Information and Opt-Out: Marriott will not sell, trade, rent or release such information to entities outside of the Marriott family of companies and hotels, for their use without your approval and giving you the opportunity to opt-out.
Links to Other Sites: If you choose to leave this Marriott site via links to other non-Marriott sites, including those of advertisers, Marriott is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of those sites, nor is Marriott responsible for the cookies those sites might deposit on your hard drive.
Legal Issues: Marriott will disclose personal information when required by law or in good faith belief if such action is necessary or desirable to comply with the law, protect or defend the rights or property of Marriott, the site or its users.
==========
Marriott.com Privacy Statement Changes: In the future, we may need to change the privacy statement for Marriott.com.
All changes will be made here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
Conclusion: Your privacy concerns are important to us.
We hope this privacy statement has been helpful to you.
