VeriSign Authentic Site
Authentic 
                    Sites like microcenter.com use a VeriSign Secure Server Digital 
                    ID to offer proof of identity, to enable secure communications 
                    and to encrypt translations with site visitors through their 
                    web browser connections.
The only way to be sure of a web 
                    site's authenticity is to view the site's Digital ID.
Viewing 
                    a site's ID assures that you are not being "spoofed" 
                    (i.e. the site is real and not an imposter) since it contains:

The name of the company which owns the web site (e.g. 
                      Micro Electronics, Inc.) 
The site's registered Internet address (e.g. www.microcenter.com) 
                    
The name of the Secure Server Certification Authority 
                      under which VeriSign issued the Digital ID (RSA Data Security 
                      or VeriSign)

To view Micro Electronics, Inc.'s Digital ID when you enter 
                    the checkout page, follow these steps for your browser:

Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and later: Click on the 
                      gold padlock to bring up the details of this site's Digital 
                      ID.
Netscape Communicator: Click on the gold padlock in the 
                      lower left corner and the View Certificate button on the 
                      Security Information page.
