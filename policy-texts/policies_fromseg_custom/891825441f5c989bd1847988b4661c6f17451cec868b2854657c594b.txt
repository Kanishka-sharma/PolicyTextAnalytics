Do we disclose any information to third parties?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personal data.
This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.
We may provide visitor information to third parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.
==========
We may disclose your personal data to the following categories of third parties:
to our group companies, third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website), or who otherwise process personal data for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that you are notified of at the time we collect your personal data.
to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;

International data transfers
Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
==========
Specifically, some of our website servers are located in the USA and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.
This means that when we collect your personal data we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
For any transfers out of the EEA, we will put in place appropriate safeguards in accordance with European law, such as executing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect the personal data that they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.
We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
Privacy Shield
IPONWEB adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
Please click here to see our Privacy Shield Policy.
Data retention
We retain personal data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
==========
Third-party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website.
These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.
We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
==========
Children’s Informaiton
Our Website is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children who are under 13 years old.
We do not knowingly collect personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) of children.
We also do not knowingly “sell,” as that term is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act, the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are California residents.
==========
Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the EEA
Data protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”).
IPONWEB acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our Website.
Legal basis for processing personal data
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
==========
However, we will normally collect personal data from you only (i) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; (ii) where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you.
If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).
If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our Websites and services; communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
We may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
==========
