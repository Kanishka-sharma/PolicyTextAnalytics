Collection and use of personal information
TCMG will, from time to time, collect and use personal information.
The types of personal information collected and the purposes for which that personal information will be used will depend on the circumstances.
For example, TCMG may collect personal information when you:

sign up as a contributor to or create a profile on The Conversation;

Other than these situations, TCMG will not disclose your personal information to third parties except:
