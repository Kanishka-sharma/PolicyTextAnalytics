MK Premium Services.
MK Premium Services offers remote access service to assist in diagnosing and resolving technical and system issues that appear on your computer.
To perform a remote connection, an agent from MK Premium Services must receive your prior explicit consent to do so.
Explicit consent — also known as express or direct consent — means that an individual is clearly presented with an option to agree or disagree with the collection, use, or disclosure of personal data and unambiguously signals his or her agreement.
Additionally, you can terminate the connection at any time.
==========
Agent will describe to you how to disconnect.
The entire process allows agent to access your device remotely to diagnose any conditions that may interfere with its performance, and either repair it or provide advice on what options are available to fix the issue.
By taking advantage of this service, you are giving agents permission to log in to your computer, which may contain your personal data, files, documents, etc.
We strongly recommend that you secure your sensitive files before the agent connects to your computer remotely.
==========
Please do not leave these files on your desktop, as it is your responsibility to make your valuable information inaccessible to prevent any type of data loss or corruption.
To make your files inaccessible to others, you can use built-in encryption tools on your computer.
Here you can find the step-by-step instructions on how to do so:
Mac user - http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/encrypt-mac-folder/;
Windows user - http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000705.htm;
In addition, we would like to inform you that even if you do not secure or encrypt your files and they are stored on your desktop, agent will only search your computer in order to identify and correct any conditions on your computer that may hinder its performance and will attempt to limit their interaction with your files to a minimum.
==========
When you request MK Premium Services, the agent will access your device remotely via third-party software, such as LogMeIn® and TeamViewer.
By accepting the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Notice of our MK Premium Services, you, therefore, accept the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy of LogMeIn® and Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy of TeamViewer.
Please read all Privacy Policies that are listed above to make sure that you agree to all conditions; otherwise, do not purchase or use our service.
