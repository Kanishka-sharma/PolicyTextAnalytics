Transactions between Buyers and Suppliers


6.1
Through the Site, Alibaba provides an electronic web-based platform 
                for exchanging information between buyers and suppliers of products 
                and services.
Alibaba does not represent the seller nor the buyer 
                in specific transactions and does not charge any commissions from 
                completing any transactions.
As a result, Alibaba does not control 
                and is not liable to or responsible for the quality, safety, lawfulness 
                or availability of the products or services offered for sale on 
                the Site or the ability of the suppliers to complete a sale or 
                the ability of buyers to complete a purchase.
==========
6.2
Users are hereby made aware that there may be risks of dealing 
                with people acting under false pretences.
Alibaba uses several 
                techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users 
                provide us when they register on the Site.
However, because user 
                verification on the Internet is difficult, Alibaba cannot and 
                does not confirm each User's purported identity (including, without 
                limitation, TrustPass Members and China Gold Suppliers).
We encourage 
                you to use the various tools available on the Site, as well as 
                common sense, to evaluate with whom you are dealing.
==========
6.3
Each User acknowledges that it is fully assuming the risks of purchase and sale transactions when using the Site to conduct transactions, and that it is fully assuming the risks of liability or harm of any kind in connection with subsequent activity of any kind relating to products or services that are the subject of transactions using the Site.
Such risks shall include, but are not limited to, mis-representation of products and services, fraudulent schemes, unsatisfactory quality, failure to meet specifications, defective or dangerous products, unlawful products, delay or default in delivery or payment, cost mis-calculations, breach of warranty, breach of contract and transportation accidents.
==========
Such risks also include the risks that the manufacture, importation, distribution, offer, display, purchase, sale and/or use of products or services offered or displayed on the Site may violate or may be asserted to violate Third Party Rights, and the risk that User may incur costs of defense or other costs in connection with third parties' assertion of Third Party Rights, or in connection with any claims by any party that they are entitled to defense or indemnification in relation to assertions of rights, demands or claims by Third Party Rights claimants.
Such risks also include the risks that consumers, other purchasers, end-users of products or others claiming to have suffered injuries or harms relating to product originally obtained by Users of the Site as a result of purchase and sale transactions in connection with using the Site may suffer harms and/or assert claims arising from their use of such products.
All of the foregoing risks are hereafter referred to as "Transaction Risks."
.
==========
Each User agrees that Alibaba shall not be liable or responsible for any damages, liabilities, costs, harms, inconveniences, business disruptions or expenditures of any kind that may arise a result of or in connection with any Transaction Risks.
6.4
Users are solely responsible for all of the terms and conditions 
                of the transactions conducted on, through or as a result of use 
                of the Site, including, without limitation, terms regarding payment, 
                returns, warranties, shipping, insurance, fees, taxes, title, 
                licenses, fines, permits, handling, transportation and storage.
