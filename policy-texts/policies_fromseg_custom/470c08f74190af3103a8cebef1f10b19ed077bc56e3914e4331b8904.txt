==========
This significant legislation created a consistent approach towards data protection.
The GDPR defines what is Personal Data, who must protect it and how such protection will be made.
Despite the fact that the GDPR is a European legislation aiming to protect EU citizens’ privacy rights, it has an effect on companies and organizations outside the EU and created a ‘ripple effect’ that pushed other countries to adopt similar rules (like the CCPA).
==========
The aim of this page is to provide our users (or “you”/ “your” etc.) with the relevant information about their privacy.
This is despite the fact that our services are mainly offered for app developers.
==========
Essentially, the users are those whose Personal Data is being processed by us.This page will (hopefully) explain what Personal Data we collect and for which reason, what do we do with the Personal Data we collect and how we collect it, as well as some additional information with respect to our roles and responsibilities under the GDPR.
The information in this page cannot cover all aspects of the GDPR and if you have more questions or if you require further information then please contact us at privacy@bigabid.com.Your Personal DataThere are two ways in which we may gain access to your data (including Personal Data):Directly via an app – while you interact with an app, you will be introduced with advertisements that we think are of relevance to you based on the specific app that you will be using.
The Personal Data we receive mostly includes device technical data (device type, OS, Device ID, app name) which is the standard in the online advertising ecosystem.
We will only keep data about your engagement with our ads if you viewed the ad / clicked on it / downloaded the promoted app for business purposes.Connection via ad exchanges – ad exchanges allow us to “see” data about users from many apps.
This information includes data we see directly, but in a scale.
==========
This allows us to identify specific users across multiple apps and based on their interaction, to find a better, more relevant advertisement to their needs and interests.
The user profile we create consists of the type of apps used (i.e. freemium gaming/RPG/ etc.), time spent on app and your advertising related activity with connection to your Device ID and location (if you provided it).
==========
Why and What do we do with your Personal DataWe collect and process Personal Data (mainly) for the following purposes:Enriching our DMP – We offer to our partners the possibility to have better performing campaigns by providing enriched data via our Data Management Platform (DMP), the data gathered from the exchanges is used for such activity and includes predictive, assumed information about your interests and demographics.Advertising – Our services help app developers to increase their users base and provide users with more accurate, more relevant advertisements.Service Improvement, Research & Analytics – We use aggregated, non-identifiable user information to further develop, customize and improve our service based on common preferences and uses, as well as for statistical and research purposes – for our internal use and for the benefit of our partners.User RightsOne of the major aspects of the GDPR is the rights (aka “data subjects” under the GDPR) that users have in relation to their Personal Data.
These rights include, for example, your right to have access to your data, to have your data deleted, corrected etc.
==========
BigaBid have taken upon itself to abide by the highest industry standards and practices of the Ad-Tech industry such as the NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) standards and compliance with the IAB TFC (Transparency and Consent Frameworks).
If you wish to exercise any of the privacy rights that you may have, you can use those tools to exercise your rights or reach out to our privacy team at: privacy@bigabid.com or to our Data Protection Officer at: dpo@bigabid.com.Roles and responsibilities (“GDPR talk”)Controller/Processor: BigaBid uses Personal Data of users from different apps within the reach of its partners and uses it for advertising purposes via its DMP.
With regards to information generated in the DMP, BigaBid will typically assume the role of Data Controller.
This means that BigaBid acts as the “decision maker” regarding Personal Data that is processed in our DMP.
It is important to note that such activity will be governed by our Privacy Policy and DPA with the different ad-exchanges we interact with.In other instances, such as via direct advertising on apps, BigaBid will act as the Data Processor of users’ Personal Data.
This means that we will process such data on behalf of our partners and in accordance with their instructions.
Our responsibilities in such cases are narrower so that if users approach us and request to exercise their rights, we will refer them to the relevant partner – who is the Controller of their Personal Data.Cross-border data transfers: BigaBid relies on appropriate legal mechanisms for cross-border transfers of Personal Data originating in the EEA.BigaBid Ltd.
