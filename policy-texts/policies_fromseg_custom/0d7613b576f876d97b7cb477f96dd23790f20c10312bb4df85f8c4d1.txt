Summary of Changes  to the WebMD Privacy Policy, effective June 11, 2012
We updated our Privacy Policy on June 11, 2012 to be  more consistent with industry standards and to allow  us to improve your experience on WebMD websites.
Our commitment to protecting your privacy and  your personal information will always be at the forefront of everything we  do.
Because we believe that advertising related to your health  interests is more valuable and of greater interest to you, we updated our  privacy policy in the following ways:

Information that WebMD collects about you may be  combined with information from other sources.
We will use this combined information to provide you with more relevant  content and advertising and for research and measurement purposes, including  measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs.
WebMD does  not make your personal information available to third parties for their  marketing purposes.
