What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services.
This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.
==========
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you may access through the Services or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.
We cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services.
We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
==========
What Information Do We Collect?
The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services.
In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information.
We may collect the following types of information from our users.
==========
User Content:
DigitalOcean collects and stores Personal Information, including the full name, company name, billing address, email address, IP address, landing page, and referring URL, for all users upon registration and use of the Services.
You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous.
Account Information:
Some features of the Services may allow you to provide content to the Services.
All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your Account.
We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
Financial Information:
We do not currently collect financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information); that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing companies (the “Payment Processors”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processors’ applicable terms of service and privacy policy.
IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:

We may automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information.
==========
This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).
Generally, the Services may automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site.
We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.
==========
Email Communications:
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.
We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.
Information Collected Using Cookies:

DigitalOcean stores cookies for visitors to the Site in order to identify them for relevant advertising through third party websites, also known as retargeting.
DigitalOcean also gathers anonymous usage information from our visitors via cookies for usage with Google Analytics.
Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website.
==========
Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit.
We may use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.
Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are.
As noted, however, we may use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
==========
This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer.
For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.
==========
Information Related to Advertising:
To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services.
These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.”
Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
DigitalOcean partners with third party advertising networks to display advertisements targeted to visitors of the Services.
To do so, DigitalOcean stores a cookie for visitors for the purpose of displaying advertising also commonly known as retargeting.
==========
The data that is stored and collected is non-identifiable and anonymous.
DigitalOcean does not disclose any Personal Information to any third party companies for purposes of partnerships or advertising.
Aggregate Information:
We may collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”).
Some of this information may be derived from Personal Information.
This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.
How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?
==========
Public Information About Your Activity on the Services:
Some of your activity on and through the Services may be public by default.
This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services.
Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts.
Unregistered users will not have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us.
==========
Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available.
Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information.
We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.
IP Address Information:
While we may collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public.
==========
We may at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.
Information You Elect to Share:
You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site.

This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.
Aggregate Information:
We may share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business.
We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them.
In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.
Email Communications with Us:
DigitalOcean will send occasional promotional materials through email and you will have the option to opt-out of these emails by either responding directly inside of the email itself or through updating your preferences in DigitalOcean’s control panel.

Information Shared with Our Agents:
We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”).

You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
==========
Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: 
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.
Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
DigitalOcean does not monitor its users’ servers or data and it is your responsibility to remain compliant with the laws of your own territory as well as the territories from which DigitalOcean operates.
Information We Share With Your Consent: 
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
