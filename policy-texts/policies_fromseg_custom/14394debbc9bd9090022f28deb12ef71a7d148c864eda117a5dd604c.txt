AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “Applovin”) is a mobile advertising company that provides application developers with a platform to deliver advertising to their consumers.
Our technology enables our partners to show mobile application users more relevant advertising that is based on users’ interest in applications.
In order to provide these services, we collect and use certain information about user activity in mobile applications.
Applovin recognizes the importance of consumer privacy and we take this issue very seriously.
To this end, we have designed the Applovin Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to explain how we collect, use, and share information through our advertising platform (“Services”) and our corporate website at www.Applovin.com (“Site”), as well as your choices related to that information.
