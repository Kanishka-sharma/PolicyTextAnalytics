Every Visa product, service and platform has a privacy notice that gives you information about what personal information is collected and how the personal information is used and disclosed.

Look for the “privacy” link at the bottom of each page.
Most Visa websites will link to the Visa Global Privacy Notice but some platforms do have their own privacy notice.
Visa’s privacy notices only address the use and disclosure of information by Visa Inc. and its Affiliates.
Please contact the financial institution or other entity that has issued your Visa card to learn about its privacy practices.
Additionally, if you are participating in a promotion or offer with a third party (such as a merchant or travel partner), please read the privacy notice given to you by that company or site owner.
==========
We use physical, technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access or loss.
Visa’s internal cross-border data transfers are covered by European Commission approved agreements, called Standard Contractual Clauses.
