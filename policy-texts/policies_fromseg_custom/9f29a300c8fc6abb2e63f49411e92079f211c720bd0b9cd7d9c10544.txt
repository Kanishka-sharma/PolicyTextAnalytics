Mad Mimi's privacy and permission policy
At Mad Mimi, protecting your privacy and the privacy of anyone on the receiving end of a Mimi-delivered email is very important.
We have thus instituted policies to help us make sure Mimi remains a safe, trusted environment for senders and recipients of email marketing campaigns.
A simple, straightforward policy on permission
Mad Mimi is a strictly permission-based email-marketing platform.
==========
Its purpose is to let organizations send emails to people who want to receive those emails.
Mad Mimi's permission policy is part of the Terms of Use agreed to by every Mad Mimi customer, and it appears as a reminder on Mad Mimi's import process every time new lists are added.
It goes beyond the stipulations set forth in the United States' Can-Spam legislation and is as follows:
To send an email to someone using Mad Mimi, that recipient must be:
Someone who is a customer, member or subscriber of your business or organization,
Someone who has specifically asked to receive your emails by opting in or signing up in some way, or
Someone who has bought a product or service from you in the past 18 months.
No list rental or purchasing here
While there are services that allow you to purchase lists of addresses of people you've never met and send them emails, Mad Mimi is not one of them.
We do not rent, sell, or in any way share our lists or those of our customers, and we do not allow any Mad Mimi customer to rent or purchase lists and send to them using the Mad Mimi framework.
No old lists, either
The age of the list matters when it comes to sending permission-based email, so if enough time passes between when someone initially subscribed to your list and is receiving an email from you, permission may have "expired".
You see, people eventually forget what they've signed up for, and in compliance with email sender best practices, we don't allow sending to any email address that has not received correspondence from you for more than 18 months.
==========
Keeping your personal information, well, personal
In order to create and administer your Mad Mimi account, we explicitly ask for and collect certain information about you and your company, including financial information used to verify identity and bill for services.
Under no circumstances will we share your (or any other member's) personal information with any third party, except in the circumstance where the requesting organization is a high-powered government agency with the authority and requisite threats of long-term jail sentences to make us share that personal information.
Otherwise, no one gets access to your information, ever.
We also collect certain aggregate information about our customers.
We use this information to improve our services and do a better job of marketing them.
We may also report such information - always in aggregate form and never in a way that could identify individuals - to third parties, such as newspapers or industry observers or potential customers and partners.
==========
Protecting your customer lists and data
We do everything we can to make sure your customer lists, email content and response data remains private and confidential.
Though we reserve the right to monitor your lists, content and response data from time to time to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use, we will never share, sell or rent your customer data to anyone for any reason.
It makes us feel icky just thinking about it.

When Mad Mimi sends emails to you
Just as we ask and expect you to respect the in-box of your customers, we will do our best to respect yours.
The only emails you'll receive from us will be emails related to your account or your use of Mad Mimi.
We might alert you to new features or site enhancements.
==========
We might check in to see how your last campaign went.
Some of those emails may be directed to everyone, and some of them may be written just for you.
In the future, we may also ask if you'd like to receive information from our partners.
We do not have partners, and until we do, we will not ask.
==========
We will not sell your email address.
We will not rent it.
We will not loan it out for the afternoon.
==========
Ensuring secure billing transactions
You are asked to supply certain credit card and billing information in order to purchase Mad Mimi's services.
That information is transferred, using the most secure transmission technology, to a trusted third party for processing.
The information is then encrypted using Data Encryption Standard 3 (Triple DES) and securely stored to handle your transactions.
Your credit card information is not stored on the Mad Mimi® website or in our database.
We do not have access to your credit card information, and we do not know whether you chose the Flowers or Picket Fence motif for your card design, though our personal preference is for the Picket Fence.
To sum things up...
Your privacy, and the privacy of people on both sides of Mad Mimi® emails, is extremely important to us, and we'll do everything we can to protect it.
Direct any questions you may have regarding this Privacy Policy to privacy@madmimi.com.
And if you suspect our privacy and permission policy has been abused in any way, please notify us at abuse@madmimi.
