Safe Harbor for EU users.
JotForm is in compliance with what was known as the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
Here's our official certification notice.
==========
However, in early Oct 2015, the Safe Harbor framework was nullified by the highest court in Europe, which meant EU users no longer had a legal safeguard guiding how their data was handled by US companies.
In response to this, JotForm has taken the ground breaking step of offering its EU users the opportunity to store their data exclusively in Europe.
This ensures EU users can retain their data in their own jurisdiction, which follows their specific data privacy requirements.
