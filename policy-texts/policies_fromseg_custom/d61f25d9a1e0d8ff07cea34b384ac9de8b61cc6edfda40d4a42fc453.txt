KHOU PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy discloses the general privacy practices
for www.khou.com.
KHOU is committed to respecting the privacy rights of
visitors to any of the KHOU web sites.
While visiting KHOU web sites
(collectively, the "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or provide
information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information")
for purposes of interacting with the Site.
To further the protection of your
Personal Information, KHOU has adopted a set of information management
guidelines (outlined below) which serve as the basis for our customer and
advertiser relationships.
These guidelines have been developed with the
recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying
business models are still not established.
Accordingly, guidelines are subject
to change.
Any such changes will be posted on this page.
Please see the
Effective Date stated at the conclusion of this Policy.
==========
Information Collected:
IP Addresses: KHOU does log IP addresses, or the location
of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting
purposes.
Use of Personal Information
KHOU may match aggregated user information with third party
data.
Also, KHOU discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
services to potential advertisers, partners and other third parties, and for
other lawful purposes.
Additionally, KHOU will use reasonable efforts to ensure
that only our employees with a "need to know" will have access to your
information.
We do not release personal information about you as an individual
to third parties.
==========
It should be noted, however, that this Privacy Policy only
addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from you.
To
the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through,
for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the like, or through
other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply.
Since
KHOU does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to
the privacy customs and policies, if any, of that third party, and KHOU shall
not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by
that third party.
Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions before you
disclose your personal information to others.
==========
Links to Other Materials

If any link is offered connecting you to a third party web
site, it is as an accommodation to the respective third party site owner and
without charge.
Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not
necessarily under the control of KHOU.
KHOU shall have no responsibilities or
liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked
site or any link or linking program at any time.
KHOU does not necessarily
endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which the Site is
linked.
If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the Site,
you do so entirely at your own risk.
KHOU hereby disclaims any rights to
trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, copyrights, patents, domain names
or other intellectual property interests of third parties.
Children’s Privacy
KHOU cares about the safety of children and their use of the
Internet.
Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable
information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental
consent.
In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected
such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent,
we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical.
==========
Effective Date and Changes
This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 11, 2000.
KHOU
reserves the right to modify the terms of this policy at any time and in our
sole discretion, by posting a change notice to this page.
Your continued use of
the Site following our posting of a change notice will constitute binding
acceptance of those changes.
