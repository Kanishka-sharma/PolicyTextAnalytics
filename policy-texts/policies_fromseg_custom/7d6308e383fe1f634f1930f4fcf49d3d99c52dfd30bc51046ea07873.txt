Your Privacy
Our Policy
Welcome!
At Dotomi, we take privacy seriously because we are proud to be a leader in the field of internet advertising and a true innovator in the way people, including ourselves, buy the things we need.
Our privacy policy is aimed to clarify what information we collect, how we safeguard it, and how we use it to provide relevant advertising about products of interest.
The effective date of this privacy policy is March 12, 2013.
==========
Dotomi was founded with the basic principle of empowering consumers with control to drive relevant advertising.
This foundation includes the belief that each consumer’s private information should be protected.
Our success, in part, comes from our ability to achieve two basic consumer needs in a holistic fashion:
Preserve every consumer's right to receive personalized advertising; and
Respect every consumer's privacy by not utilizing personally-identifiable information to determine what products and services are of interest to them.
Dotomi's team is comprised of industry leaders that have been involved in internet advertising and consumer privacy from the very beginning of the online space.
This experience has helped us forge a business around one central belief: it is possible to provide each individual consumer with the privacy they deserve, while giving them access to valuable information about products and services that interest them.
Scope of Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Dotomi's online method of collection and use of anonymous information gathered by us for this website www.dotomi.com and clients that we serve.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of our clients.
How Does Dotomi Provide Consumers with Relevant Advertising?
We partner with Marketing companies ("Marketing Partners") whose Privacy Policy allows them to share anonymous information about their customers and/or inquirers as well as information about a consumer’s interests and/or purchase behavior.
==========
This information may include the date and time of a visit to a Marketing Partner’s website, the pages or product information viewed during that visit, and links or ads that were clicked.
Some Marketing Partners contribute Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") such as your name, address, email address, and transactional information directly to a third party with whom Dotomi has a contractual relationship.
This third party renders all such PII anonymous before providing it to Dotomi for our use in providing personalized advertising to you.
The combined Marketing Partner information allows us to analyze and understand more about the things you are or might be interested in, allowing Dotomi to replace advertisements with ones more relevant to you.
Dotomi contracts with publisher networks to deliver ads that are relevant to your interests.
At times, where permitted, we may use anonymous data aggregated from these publisher networks to further enhance online display advertisements delivered to you.
Dotomi does not collect or maintain PII for marketing purposes.
This means that we do not accept or use your name, address, email address, or any sensitive information such as your credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or medical records to provide our personalized advertising service.
How Does Dotomi Find Consumers on the Web?
When a consumer visits our website or one of our Marketing Partner's websites, technologies such as "cookies" or "pixel tags" may be placed on the consumer’s machine.
Information collected from these technologies are not linked to PII.
No PII is transferred to Dotomi via these technologies.
Dotomi only knows that consumer by an anonymous ID, so that we can replace non-relevant ads with ads that are more relevant to the consumer’s presumed interests.
Again, we don't know who the consumer is, we just know the consumer's preferences through that ID.
==========
What is a "Cookie" or "Pixel Tag"?
A cookie is an industry-standard small data file placed on a consumer's computer.
Cookies allow marketers to "remember you" when you return to their website.
==========
Again, no PII is transferred in the Dotomi cookie.
Consumers have the capability of deleting cookies on their machine; however, if they enjoy the convenience of a website remembering them, consumers are advised not to delete their cookies.
This website may contain, in addition to Dotomi cookies, other third party cookies that assist us in supplying information that will make it easier for you to navigate on our site.
==========
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon) is an industry-standard, often-transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed in a website or e-mail.
Again, no PII is transferred in this pixel tag.
Dotomi cookies and pixel tags do not track the consumer outside this site or of the Marketing Partners websites or e-mail unless it is to display an advertisement.
Pixel tags are used by Dotomi to transfer relevant anonymous data from this website or a Marketing Partner's website to Dotomi’s servers for the purpose of providing personalized media.
Cookies are used by Dotomi to link this anonymous data to non-identified unique users.
Pixel tags and cookies may also be used to link additional non-identifiable information provided by a third party to Marketing Partner's data.
Disclosure of Information
We may disclose proprietary, anonymous information to our Marketing Partners and advertisers for reporting purposes, and we may share anonymous, aggregated information with other third parties for advertising, marketing and analytical purposes.
==========
Dotomi may also need to disclose anonymous information if (1) we believe that there has been a violation of the law, of your rights, or of our rights, (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, and (3) if our company or substantially all of its assets are acquired.
Data Retention
If you are a client of Dotomi and have an account with us, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please use the opt-out link below.
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Dotomi retains data it uses for marketing purposes for 13 months, after which the information is erased.
