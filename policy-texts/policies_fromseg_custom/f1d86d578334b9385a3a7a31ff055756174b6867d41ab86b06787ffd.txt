General.
==========
This agreement ("Agreement") covers the terms on which we agree to provide and you agree to accept any service or product we make available to you, including your wireless services, wireless devices, etc. (collectively "Services").
You accept this Agreement when you do any of the following: (a) provide your written or electronic signature; (b) accept through an oral or electronic statement; © attempt to or in any way use any of the Services; (d) pay for any Services; or (e) open any materials or package that says you are accepting when you open it.
The Agreement includes the terms in this document together with the terms associated with the Services you select (as described in our marketing materials, e.g., service plan brochures, or on our website).
You represent that you are at least 18 years old.
==========
In this document, we use the words "we," "us," "our" or "Sprint" to refer to Sprint Spectrum L.P. and its affiliates doing business as Sprint PCS.
Agreement.
We may change the Agreement at any time with notice.
Any changes to the Agreement are effective when we publish them.
If you use our Services or make any payment to us on or after the effective date of the changes, you accept the changes.
If we change a material term of the Agreement and that change has a material adverse effect on you, you may terminate the Agreement without an Early Termination Fee by calling 1-888-567-5528 within 30 days after the changes go into effect.
==========
You understand and agree that taxes, Universal Service fees and other charges imposed by the government or based on government calculations may increase or decrease on a monthly basis, and that this paragraph does not apply to any increases in such taxes, Universal Service fees or other charges.
Activating Service.
==========
Before activation, we may check your credit and verify your identity.
You must have and maintain satisfactory credit to receive and continue to receive Services.
We may charge a nonrefundable activation fee, deposit, prepayment or other fee to establish or maintain Services.
==========
Term Commitments.
Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, our service plans require that you maintain service for a minimum term ("Term Service Plan"), usually 1 or 2 years.
After satisfying this minimum term, your service plan will continue on a month-to-month basis unless you have agreed to extend the term for additional period(s).
Certain service, promotional or product offers may require that you agree to or extend a Term Service Plan.
As discussed below, we may charge you an Early Termination Fee if you deactivate a Term Service Plan before the end of the term.
==========
Using Services.
You agree to not use our Services in an unlawful, fraudulent or abusive manner.
You may not resell or lease Services to anyone.
Sprint is not responsible for any opinions, advice, statements, services applications or other information provided by third parties and accessible through our various Services, including the internet.
Neither Sprint, its vendors or licensors guarantees the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of information that is obtained through these Services.
==========
You are responsible for evaluating such content.
You are also responsible for any use of our Services through any wireless device on your account including, but not limited to, use by children or minors.
We strongly recommend that you closely monitor any such usage.
==========
Changing Services.
Changes to Services will generally be effective at the start of your next full invoicing cycle.
==========
In certain instances, the changes may take place sooner, in which case your invoice will reflect pro-rated charges.
Certain changes may be conditioned upon payment of an Early Termination Fee or certain other charges.
Termination of Services.
==========
Consistent with this Agreement: (a) we may terminate Services at any time with notice to you and, in certain instances, without notice; and (b) you may terminate Services at any time with prior notice to us.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, IF YOU TERMINATE YOUR TERM SERVICE PLAN EARLY, OR WE DO SO FOR GOOD CAUSE, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE APPLICABLE EARLY TERMINATION FEE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR SERVICES.
==========
We will not charge an Early Termination Fee for deactivations consistent with our Return Policy or for service plans being provided on a month-to-month basis.
If any Services are terminated before the end of your current invoicing cycle, we will not prorate charges to the date of termination, and you will not receive a credit or refund for any unused Services.
==========
Wireless Devices, Numbers & E-mail Addresses.
We did not manufacture your wireless device and we are not responsible for any defects or for the acts or omissions of the manufacturer.
The only warranties on your device are any limited warranties extended by the manufacturer directly to you or passed on to you through us.
Your device may not accept Services directly from any other carrier.
==========
You do not have any rights to any number, e-mail address or other identifier we may assign to your device or account; you may not modify, change or transfer any of these except as we allow or as allowed for by law.
In certain instances, you may transfer your number from another carrier to us, or from us to another carrier.
==========
We do not guarantee that transfers to or from us will be successful.
If you transfer your number away from us, the terms of this Agreement (e.g., Early Termination Fee, etc.) still apply.
If a transfer to Sprint is not successful, you will be responsible for any discounts provided to you with the purchase of your device.
See our printed in-store materials or visit www.sprintpcs.com for additional important information on number transfers.
==========
Coverage.
Available coverage areas for Services are generally identified in our mapping brochures and at www.sprintpcs.com.
This may include coverage on our digital network (the "Sprint Nationwide PCS Network") as well as coverage we make available to you through agreements with other carriers ("off network" or "roaming" coverage).
All coverage maps are high level representations of outdoor coverage and there are gaps in coverage within areas shown as covered on the maps.
Coverage is not available everywhere, nor can we guarantee you will receive coverage at all times, or without interruptions or delays (e.g., dropped calls, blocked calls, etc.) in the coverage areas we identify.
Actual coverage and quality of Services may be affected by conditions within or beyond our control, including network problems, software, signal strength, your equipment, structures (including buildings in which you may be located), atmospheric, geographic, or topographic conditions.
==========
Roaming Coverage.
You are roaming anytime your phone indicates that you are roaming.
Roaming coverage is only available with certain devices and, unless included as part of your Services, will result in additional charges.
Roaming calls placed "manually" (through an operator or with a credit card) will always incur separate and additional charges.
Depending on your phone settings, you may automatically roam if there is a gap or interruption in coverage within the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network coverage area and roaming coverage areas.
See your phone guide for how to adjust phone settings.
Certain features and services may not be available in roaming coverage areas (including PCS Vision, voicemail, call waiting, call forwarding, etc.).
Charges.
==========
Carefully review the terms of your Services.
You will be assessed charges based on the terms of your Services including, without limitation, monthly recurring charges and charges based on actual usage (e.g., charges for long distance, roaming, call forwarding, directory assistance, etc.).
==========
Airtime and other time based usage charges are calculated from when your device first initiates contact with a network until the network connection is broken, whether or not you were actually successful in connecting to the intended destination.
However, you will not be charged for voice calls that ring and do not pick up, or if you get a busy signal.
For voice calls received by your device, you are charged from the time shortly before the phone starts ringing until the call is terminated.
You are charged for an entire voice call based on the time period in which the call is initiated.
==========
Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next minute.
Sprint PCS Vision Charges.
==========
Vision usage is measured in bytes, not in minutes.
Bytes are rounded up to kilobytes.
==========
Usage rounding occurs at the top of each clock hour while in a session and at the end of each session and is then charged to you based on the terms of your Services.
Depending on your Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per kilobyte.
Usage charges may be rounded up to the next cent at monthly or other intervals.
In certain instances, you may not know that your session has not ended.
==========
As long as your device is connected to our network, you will incur data usage charges.
You will be charged for all data directed to the internet address (or "IP address") assigned to your device, regardless of who initiates the activity or whether your device actually receives the data.
==========
This includes, but is not limited to, the amount of data associated with the particular information/item (e.g. game, ringer, email, etc.), additional data used in accessing, transporting and routing this information/item on our network, data from partial or interrupted downloads, re-sent data, and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications.
Based on these and a number of other factors (e.g., the specific application, network performance, etc.) data used and charged to you will vary widely, even for the same activity.
Estimates of data usage - for example, the size of downloadable files - will not be accurate or a reliable predictor of actual usage.
Your invoice will not separately identify the number of kilobytes attributable to your use of specific sites, sessions or services.
==========
Taxes and Surcharges.
We invoice you for taxes, fees and other charges levied by or remitted directly to federal, state, local or foreign governments including, without limitation, sales, gross receipts, Universal Service, use, and excise taxes.
==========
If you claim any tax exemption, you must provide us with a valid tax-exempt document.
Tax exemptions are not applied retroactively.
==========
We also invoice you for surcharges that we collect and keep to pay for the costs of complying with government programs such as number pooling and portability, and Enhanced 911 service; these charges are not the taxes nor government imposed assessments.
Invoicing & Payment.
Invoicing cycles and dates may change from time to time.
Monthly recurring and related charges for Services are generally invoiced one invoicing cycle in advance.
Other charges are invoiced soon after they are incurred.
Most usage is generally applied to the invoicing cycle in which they are incurred, but in some instances may be applied to subsequent invoicing cycles.
==========
You are responsible for all charges associated with any device activated on your account, regardless of who used the device.
You must pay all charges by the due date on the invoice.
Past due amounts accrue late charges until paid at the rate of 5% per month or at the highest rate allowed by law and may result in immediate suspension of your account.
==========
If you agree to any auto-payment option through banking or credit account, we may initiate payment from the account for all amounts we invoice you without additional authorization or notice.
Based on your credit or payment history, we may require certain forms of guaranteed payment as a condition of maintaining Services.
If we invoice you for amounts on behalf of a third-party, payments received are first applied to amounts due to us.
You may be charged additional fees for certain methods of payment and for payments denied by a financial institution.
Acceptance of payments (even if marked "paid in full") does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe us.
==========
Disputed Charges.
Disputes concerning any charges invoiced must be raised within 60 days of the date of the invoice.
You accept all charges not disputed in this time period.
Disputes can only be made by calling or writing us as directed on your invoice.
==========
Account Spending Limit & Deposits.
We may impose an account spending limit ("ASL") on any account without notice.
We will notify you of an ASL based on your credit or payment history and may reduce the ASL at any time with prior notice.
An ASL should not be relied on to manage usage on your account.
==========
We may suspend an account without prior notice when the account balance reaches the ASL, even if the account is not past due.
Services can be restored upon payment of an amount that brings the account balance below the ASL and any past due amounts.
If we require a deposit for you to establish or maintain an account, we will hold the deposit as partial guarantee of payment for Services.
==========
We may change the deposit amount at any time with notice for good reason.
Except as we allow, a deposit may not be used to pay any invoice or delay payment.
The deposit amount, the length of time we hold the deposit and changes to the deposit amount are determined based on your credit and payment history.
==========
The rate of interest, if any, on the deposit is subject to change.
We may mix deposits with our other funds.
==========
If your account is terminated for any reason, we may without notice apply your deposit to any outstanding charges.
We may send any remaining deposit amounts to your last known address within 75 days after account termination.
If the funds are returned to us, you may claim these funds for one year from the date of return.
==========
Any money held during this one-year period will not accrue interest for your benefit and are subject to a servicing fee charged against the balance.
You forfeit any portion of the money left after the one-year period.
==========
Other Sprint PCS Vision Terms.
You will not receive voice calls while using Vision.
==========
Vision is not available for use with server devices or host computer applications, other systems that drive continuous heavy traffic or data sessions, or as substitutes for private lines or frame relay connections.
Unlimited Vision plans/options may not be used with Sprint PCS phones or smart phones being used as a modem in connection with other equipment (e.g., computers, etc.) through use of connection kits or other phone-to-computer/PDA accessories, or Bluetooth or other wireless technology.
==========
We may terminate services without notice for any misuse.
You may have access to certain games, ringers, screen savers and other items on our Vision site ("Premium Services") that are available for an additional charge.
==========
You will be billed for Premium Service purchases on your Sprint PCS invoice based on the charges as specified at purchase.
Subject to the terms of the content purchased, we may delete premium and non-premium items downloaded to any storage areas we may provide, including any pictures, games and other content.
We may limit the amount of Premium Services you may purchase in a specific timeframe (month, week, day, or other time period).
==========
Voice Command.
Calls to 911 or similar emergency numbers cannot be placed through the Voice Command feature.
==========
See our printed in-store materials or visit www.sprintpcs.com for additional important information on this option.
Wireless Web.
Wireless Web Services may be available depending on your device and Service plan/option.
==========
This is not a Vision service.
Usage is calculated on minutes used and generally deducts from your Service plan minutes.
See our printed in-store materials or visit www.sprintpcs.com for additional important information on this option.
==========
Lost or Stolen Equipment.
If your device is lost or stolen, please notify us immediately by calling 1-888-211-4PCS.
==========
You are responsible for all charges incurred before you notify us of the loss or theft.
You agree to cooperate reasonably with us in investigating suspected unlawful or fraudulent use.
==========
Identity Fraud.
Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation.
Sprint is committed to helping consumers combat identity theft as quickly and painlessly as possible.
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name, address, Social Security number (SSN), or other identifying information without your knowledge to commit fraud or other crimes.
==========
In the telecommunications industry, an account is established using this stolen information to avoid paying for services.
This act is commonly referred to as "subscriber fraud".
==========
If you have been contacted by a collection agency regarding an outstanding debt with Sprint, and you have never had Sprint service, Sprint requires you to complete an ID theft packet and send it to our office so that we can properly investigate your case.
The 
Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) website
 contains information on how identity theft occurs and what you can do in the future to avoid being a victim.
Also included in this site is an 
ID Theft Affidavit
.
This form must be completed and sent to us, in order to properly handle your case.
==========
When completing the packet, all the following requested information must be provided, in full, in order for the dispute to be processed:

Copy of state-issued Driver's License or state-issued Identification Card
Copy or actual proof of residence for the past 3 years (example: rental/lease agreement in your name, utility bills, copy of insurance bill, or tax documentation)
Copy of Police report (if applicable)
Affidavit must be notarized

NOTE: If you are just looking to dispute the balance of a debt owed to an account you activated, please contact the Outside Collection agency directly.
Sprint Fraud Management does not process these types of disputes.
The completed fraud packet, with all of the information listed above, should be mailed to the following address:

	Sprint Fraud Management 
	ATTN: OCA Dispute
	Mailstop: KSLNXX0202
	11300 Corporate Avenue
	Lenexa, KS  66219-1385

Once the packet is received, Sprint will review the documentation and contact the victim by mail with the result of the investigation.
==========
It may take up to 10 days from the date of receipt to fully investigate your case.
However, if you would like your case to be reviewed faster, you may overnight your packet to the address listed above.
Sprint will review these packets within 48 business hours of receipt.
==========
If the account is confirmed fraud, Sprint will close the account that was opened using your name and personal information and will adjust any balance on the account to zero.
Any collection agency assigned will be notified that the account is fraudulent.
It may be necessary for Sprint to contact you during normal business hours regarding your claim, so please ensure you provide a valid daytime contact number.
We also recommend you keep a copy of all documents submitted for your records.
Sprint is committed to maintaining quality customer focus.
We regret this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience.
==========
Messaging.
You may incur charges in accessing, sending or receiving messages on your device.
We may impose limits on the number of voicemail, text, email or other messages  that can be retained through your account.
Indicators of messages on your device, including mailbox icons, may not always provide an up to date indication of new messages and you may at times need to manually reset or clear your mailbox indicator.
Legitimate messages may be interrupted by software aimed at prevention of SPAM or similar messages.
==========
Caller ID.
If you do not want people you call to receive the number assigned to your phone, call us at 1-888-211-4PCS for information about automatic Caller ID blocking.
The number assigned to your phone can be blocked on a per-call basis by dialing *67 + Destination Number + TALK (or similar key).
Caller ID blocking is not available when using Vision or Wireless Web services.
==========
TTY Access.
A TTY (also known as TDD or Text Telephone) is a telecommunications device that allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who have speech or language disabilities, to communicate by telephone.
TTY doesn't work with all devices.
If you have a TTY-capable device, it may not function effectively, or at all, when attempting 911 calls and should not be relied on for such calls.
==========
Disclaimer of Warranties.
WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OF WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES OR WIRELESS DEVICE.
==========
WE DO NOT PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND YOU AGREE TO HOLD US HARMLESS FOR ALL SUCH PROBLEMS.
Limitation of Liability.
Neither we nor our vendors, suppliers or licensors are liable for any damages arising out of or in connection with any: (a) act or omission by your, or another person or company; (b) providing or failing to provide Services, including deficiencies or problems with your wireless device, our network coverage or Services (e.g., dropped, blocked, interrupted calls/messages, etc.); © traffic or other accidents, or any health-related claims allegedly arising from the use of Services, any wireless devices or related accessories; (d) content or information accessed while using our Services, such as through the internet; (e) interruption or failure in accessing or attempting to access emergency services from your phone, including through 911, E911 or otherwise; or (f) events due to factors beyond our control, including acts of God (including, without limitation, weather-related phenomena, fire or earthquake), war, riot, strike, or orders of governmental authority.
==========
In the event we are found to be responsible to you for monetary damages relating to the Services (including wireless devices), you agree that any such damages will not exceed the pro-rated monthly recurring charge for your Services during the affected period.
NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES, PHONES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
==========
THIS SECTION SURVIVES TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES.
INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT,  YOU AND SPRINT AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SERVICES, ANY PHONES/EQUIPMENT, OR ADVERTISING, EVEN IF IT ARISES AFTER YOUR SERVICES HAVE TERMINATED, AND INCLUDING CLAIMS YOU MAY BRING AGAINST SPRINT'S EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR THAT SPRINT MAY BRING AGAINST YOU ("CLAIMS").
==========
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS PROVISIONS, NOT STATE LAW, GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS OF WHETHER A CLAIM IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION.
THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PREVENT EITHER YOU OR SPRINT FROM BRINGING APPROPRIATE CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, BEFORE THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION OR A STATE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.
YOU AND SPRINT FURTHER AGREE THAT NEITHER SPRINT NOR YOU WILL JOIN ANY CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY IN A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING; THAT NO CLAIM EITHER SPRINT OR YOU HAS AGAINST THE OTHER SHALL BE RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS; AND THAT NEITHER SPRINT NOR YOU WILL ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE.
==========
IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO A CLAIM, WE AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY.
A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law will conduct the arbitration.
The arbitration will be filed with and the arbitrator will be selected according to the rules of either JAMS or the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF"), or, alternatively, as we may mutually agree.
We agree to act in good faith in selecting an arbitrator.
The arbitration will be conducted by and under the then-applicable rules of JAMS or NAF, wherever the arbitration is filed or, if the arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement of the parties, the then-applicable rules of JAMS will apply unless the parties agree otherwise.
==========
All expedited procedures prescribed by the applicable rules will apply.
We agree to pay our respective arbitration costs, except as otherwise required by rules of JAMS or NAF, as applicable, but the arbitrator can apportion these costs as appropriate.
==========
The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
If any party files a judicial or administrative action asserting a claim that is subject to arbitration and another party successfully stays such action or compels arbitration, the party filing that action must pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including attorneys' fees.
If any portion of this Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes section is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Section remains in full force and effect.
Miscellaneous.
==========
You may notify us by calling us at 1-888-211-4PCS, or use that number to get our current address for written notice.
We may send you notice to your last known address in our invoicing records, or by calling leaving you a voice message on your wireless device or home phone.
Properly addressed written notice is effective three days after deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid.
==========
This Agreement is governed by and must be construed under federal law and the laws of the State of Kansas, without regard to choice of law principles.
If either of us waives or fails to enforce any requirement under this Agreement in any one instance, that does not waive our right to later enforce that requirement.
If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect.
==========
Section headings are for descriptive, non-interpretive purposes only.
You may not assign this Agreement to any other person or entity without our prior written approval.
This Agreement (including any referenced documents and attachments) makes up the entire agreement between us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreements.
