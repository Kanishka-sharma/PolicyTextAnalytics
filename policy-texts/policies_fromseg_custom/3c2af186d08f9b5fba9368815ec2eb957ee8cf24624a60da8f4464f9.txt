Notice and Takedown Policy of GearBest
As an online seller, GearBest acts in good faith and has developed a robust Notice and TakedownPolicy to protect the respective Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of third parties and consumers.
It is our stated policy to respond to clear notices of alleged IPR infringement.
As intellectual property owners are ultimately responsible for protecting their own intellectual property, and GearBest is not a legal expert in IPR matters, we need your help in identifying what you believe may potentially infringe your IP rights.

Pleasenote: 
Any misrepresentations and inaccuracies made in your Notice regarding whether material or activity is infringing may expose you to liability and damages.
Courts have found that you must consider IP defenses, limitations or exceptions before sending a Notice.
