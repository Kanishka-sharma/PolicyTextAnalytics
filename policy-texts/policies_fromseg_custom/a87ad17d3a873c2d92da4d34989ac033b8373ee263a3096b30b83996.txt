Last updated: 02/21/2014
This Seller Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“you,” “your”) and Square, Inc. (“Square,” “we,” “our” or “us”) governing your use of Square’s mobile applications and websites (including Square Market), payment processing services, hardware, and other products and services (together, the “Services”).
Please read this Agreement carefully.
This Agreement is divided into two parts.
Part One explains the terms that govern your use of the Services.

Part Two contains additional legal terms, including provisions that limit our liability to you and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute.
To use the Services, you must accept all of the terms of this Agreement.
Part One: Terms Governing Use of the Service

Our registration process will ask you for information including your name and other personal information.
You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions.
You must complete this and other processes to access any funds that you accept through the Services.
You must also keep the information that you provide up-to-date.
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the Square Account of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply with the account registration requirements.
2.
==========
Name
You must use your or your business’ true and accurate name when signing up for a Square Account.
Ideally, the name you choose will be a reasonably descriptive name that clearly identifies you or your business.
This name will appear on the Buyer’s credit or debit card statement for all payments you accept using the Services.

Software
The software associated with mobile and website applications and hardware products is part of the Services.

Verification and Inspection
If your request to open a Square Account is approved, Square may request additional information from you at any time.
Square may ask you to present invoices from your suppliers, a government issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, or a business license.
Square may also ask for permission to inspect your business location.
If you refuse any of these requests, your Square Account may be suspended or terminated.
5.
==========
Compatible Mobile Devices and Third Party Carriers
Your Square Account permits you to accept payment Card transactions, and to account for cash transactions, on compatible mobile devices.
Devices modified contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including but not limited to those with disabled hardware or software controls—sometimes referred to as “jail broken”—are not compatible mobile devices.
You acknowledge that the use of a modified device to use the Services is expressly prohibited, constitutes a violation of the terms of this Agreement, and is grounds for termination of your Square Account.
Square does not warrant that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or third party carrier.
Your use of the Services may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer and your carrier.
6.
==========

The Services and your Square Account may only be used for business purposes in the fifty states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia.
You may not export the Services directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Services may be subject to export restrictions imposed by US law, including US Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. Chapter VII).

7.
==========
Our Role
The Services allow you to accept payments, including Card-based payments initiated with Cards bearing the trademarks of MasterCard International Inc. and Visa Inc. (collectively, the “Networks”).
We are not a bank and we do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury.
As a payment service provider, Square facilitates the processing of payments you receive from your Buyers.
This means that we collect, analyze and relay information generated in connection with these payments.
==========
In order to serve in this role, we must enter into agreements with Networks, processors and acquiring banks.
In some cases, Visa and MasterCard require that our Sellers enter into an agreement directly with Square’s acquiring bank.
If you are such a Seller we will provide you a “Commercial Entity Agreement” that you must complete in order to use the Services.
==========
This may happen during the registration process or at some other time.
If you fail to complete a “Commercial Entity Agreement,” we may suspend or terminate your Square Account.
Similarly, if you are a high value customer, American Express may require that you maintain your agreement directly with them and designate Square as your agent for American Express payments.
If that is the case, you will be notified of such requirement.
8.
==========
Your Authorization
You authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf.
Your authorization permits us to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each payment transaction that you authorize.
Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until your Square Account is closed or terminated.
9.
Restricted Use
Square-provided hardware products are for your use with the Services, and you may not act as a hardware product reseller.
You may not act as a payment intermediary, aggregator or service bureau or otherwise resell the Services on behalf of any third party.
==========
This means that you may not use the Services to handle, process or transmit funds for any third party.
You also may not use the Services to process cash advances.
10.
==========
Unauthorized or Illegal Use
We may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe that the transaction is in violation of this Agreement or any other Square agreement, or that it exposes you, other Square customers, our processors or Square to harm.
Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts.
If we reasonably suspect that your Square Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Square Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement.
11.
==========
Accepted Cards
Square works with any US-issued and most non-US issued credit, debit, prepaid, or gift cards (“Cards”) with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover logo.
We may remove or add Cards that we accept at any time without prior notice.
We will generally only process Cards that receive an authorization from the applicable Network and Card issuer.
You understand that there may be times when the Buyer may not be the authorized user of the Card or that such Buyer may otherwise contest the transaction through the Chargeback process (described below).
You agree to comply with the Chargeback process and to liability associated with such Chargebacks.
12.
==========
Applicable Network Rules
The Networks require that you and Square comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations (“Network Rules”).
The Networks amend their rules and regulations from time to time.
Square may be required to change this Agreement in connection with amendments to the Network Rules.
Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public at www.visa.com, www.mastercard.com, and www.americanexpress.com.
Network Rules currently prohibit you from dispensing cash on any Card transaction.
The Rules also restrict your ability to assess a surcharge or split a single transaction in to multiple transactions except in certain limited situations.
Your use of Network logos is governed by the Rules; you agree to familiarize yourself with and to comply with these requirements.
13.
==========
Underwriting
Square will review the information that you submit in connection with your request to sign up for the Services.
You agree that Square may share information about you and your Square Account with its processor and/or acquiring bank.
After you submit your application, Square or its processor and/or acquiring bank may conclude that you will not be permitted to use the Services.
You authorize Square to request identity verifying information about you, including a consumer report that contains your name and address.
==========
You further agree that Square may periodically obtain additional reports to determine whether you continue to meet the requirements for a Square Account.
You agree that Square is permitted to share information about you and your application (including whether you are approved or declined), and your Square Account with your bank or other financial institution.
This includes sharing information (a) about your transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes, (b) for use in connection with the management and maintenance of the Service, (c) to create and update their customer records about you and to assist them in better serving you, and (d) to conduct Square’s risk management process.
14.
==========
Our Fees
You agree to pay the applicable fees listed on our Fee Schedule (“Fees”) for use of the Services.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we reserve the right to change our Fees upon thirty days’ advance notice.
You must agree to the change in Fees to continue to use the Services.

All Balances and all Fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Services are denominated in US dollars.

==========
Access to Square Account Funds
Subject to the payout schedule identified below, we will deposit amounts received by us for transactions you submit through the Services (less any applicable Fees) to your verified bank account.

In the event that you do not have an ACH-enabled bank account linked to your Square Account, you may request a physical check.
Check requests may be subject to a processing fee and an identity verification process.
It is your obligation to request a check or otherwise link an ACH-enabled bank account to your Square Account in order to receive your funds.
==========
Funds for any given transaction will not be deposited until the transaction is deemed complete.
Transactions will be deemed complete when we have received or sent the funds and when we or the designated financial institutions have accepted the transaction or funds.
15b.
==========
Right of Setoff
You grant us a security interest in, as well as a right of setoff against, and hereby assign, convey, deliver, pledge and transfer to us, as security for repayment of any obligations due under this Agreement, all of your right, title, and interest in and to all of your accounts with us.
However, this grant will not apply to any accounts for which the grant of a security interest would be prohibited by law.
You authorize us, without prior notice to you and irrespective of (i) whether we have made demand under this Agreement or any other related agreements; and (ii) whether the obligation is contingent, matured or unmatured, to the extent permitted by law, to collect, charge, and/or setoff all sums owing on the indebtedness against any and all such accounts and other obligations, and our option, to administratively freeze or direct any third party bank holding the account to freeze all such accounts to allow us to protect our security interest, collection, charge and setoff rights as provided for in this section.
16.
==========
Payout Schedule - Standard
Once you validate your US bank account, and have ten dollars or more in your Square Account, Square will automatically initiate a payout to your bank account at the end of every business day.
Payouts to your bank account for payments received by you during business hours (before 5pm Pacific Time) will usually fund the next business day.
17.
==========
Availability of Funds
Should Square need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Square Account, we may defer payout or restrict access to your funds for the entire time it takes for us to do so.
We also may defer payout or restrict access to your funds as necessary to comply with applicable law or court order, or if otherwise requested by law enforcement or governmental entity.
18.
==========
Square Account History
When a payment is made to your Square Account, we will update your Square Account activity on the website and provide you a transaction confirmation.
The confirmation will serve as your receipt.
Summaries of your Square Account activity, including monthly statements, are available on our website for up to one year of account activity.
Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Square Account and your use of the Services, and (b) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Square Account.
If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Square Account, you agree to contact us immediately.
19.
==========
Reserve
At any time and from time to time, we may temporarily suspend or delay payments to you and/or designate an amount of funds that we must maintain in your Square Account or in a separate reserve account (a “Reserve”) to secure the performance of your payment obligations under this Agreement.
We may require a Reserve for any reason, including if you have a high rate of Chargebacks (described in Section 27), refunds, or other indications of performance problems related to your use of the Services.
The Reserve will be in an amount as reasonably determined by us or our processor to cover anticipated Chargebacks, returns, unshipped merchandise and/or unfulfilled products or services or credit risk based on your processing history.
The Reserve may be raised, reduced or removed at any time by Square, in its sole discretion, based on your payment history, a credit review, the amount of any arbitration award or court judgment against you in Square’s favor, or otherwise as Square or its processor may determine or require.
If you do not have sufficient funds in your Reserve, we may fund the Reserve from any funding source associated with your Square Account, including but not limited to any funds (a) deposited by you, (b) due to you under this Agreement, or (c) available in your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with us.
You grant us a security interest in and lien on any and all funds held in any Reserve, and also authorize us to make any withdrawals or debits from the Reserve, without prior notice to you, to collect amounts that you owe us under this Agreement, including without limitation for any reversals of deposits or transfers made to your Square Account.
==========
You will execute any additional documentation required for us to perfect our security interest in any funds in the Reserve.
This security interest survives for as long as we hold funds in your Reserve.
20.
==========
Square Account Balances
You are not required to hold monetary balances that you receive in your Square Account (your “Balance”).
If you end up with a Balance, your funds will be co-mingled and held with other participants’ funds in one or more pooled accounts at one or more FDIC-insured banks by us on your behalf and for the benefit of you and others holding balances (each a “Pooled Account”).
US dollar balances held in the pooled account are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance, meaning that your Balance may be insured up to the FDIC maximum, which is currently $250,000.
We have sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any pooled account.
Funds associated with your Square Account will at all times be held separate from our corporate funds.
==========
We will not use your funds for our corporate purposes (including the granting of any security or similar interest), will not voluntarily make funds available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose, and will not knowingly permit our creditors to attach the funds.
You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that we handle for you.
As consideration for using the Services, you irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to our holding of your Balance in a pooled account or Reserve (described above).
21.
==========
Receipts
When your Buyer is present at the time of the transaction and signs the Square signature screen, you benefit from the Network Rules for card present transactions.
You agree to request that your Buyer personally sign for all transactions greater than $25.00 when your Buyer is present.
You must make a written receipt available to your Buyers for any transaction greater than $15.00.
You may give your Buyers the option to receive or decline a written receipt.
As a convenience, but not in lieu of a written receipt, the Square receipt screen offers Buyers a choice to sign-up to receive digital receipts delivered by Square through SMS or email.
22.
==========
Receipts for 501(c)(3) Organizations
If you operate a 501(c)(3) organization, you may offer Square electronic receipts to your donors as a convenience, by completing the required fields in the “Account” section of our website.
You acknowledge that not all payments made to your organization will be eligible for classification as “tax deductible to the extent allowed by law,” and you assume full responsibility for the classification of your transactions.
Square specifically disclaims any liability in this regard.
23.
==========
Usage of Shortcode (778273)
You agree that Square may send you real-time receipts via a text message, which you may also use as secondary authentication.
Standard message and data rates may apply (check with your carrier).
You may start by entering your mobile phone number during a transaction with a Buyer, or by opting-in at squareup.com.
For help, text HELP to 778273, text STOP to quit.
24.
==========
Taxes
You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason in connection your use of our software and services (“Taxes”).
You also are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority.
We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction.
Square specifically disclaims any liability for Taxes.
==========
If in a given calendar year you receive (i) more than $20,000 in gross amount of payments and (ii) more than 200 payments, Square will report annually to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), as required by law, your name, address, Tax Identification Number (such as a Social Security Number (SSN), or Employer Identification Number (EIN)), the total dollar amount of the payments you receive in a calendar year, and the total dollar amount of the payments you receive for each month in a calendar year.
Whether you reach $20,000 in payments or more than 200 payments will be determined by looking at the SSN associated with your Square Account.
25.
==========
Customer Service
You are solely responsible for all customer service issues relating to your goods or services, including pricing, order fulfillment, order cancellation by you or a Buyer, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, technical support, and feedback concerning experiences with your personnel, policies or processes.
In performing customer service, you will always present yourself as a separate entity from us.
As between you and us, we are solely responsible for customer service issues relating to any Square Account, payment, Card processing, debiting or crediting.
26.
==========
Refunds and Returns
By accepting payment Card transactions with a Square, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your Square Account in accordance with this Agreement and Network Rules.
Network Rules require that you will (a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to Buyers at the time of purchase, (c) not give cash refunds to a Buyer in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund.
The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the Buyer for postage that the Buyer paid to return merchandise.
If you accept returns and are making an uneven exchange of merchandise (e.g., the sales price is not the same), you must issue a credit for the total amount of the merchandise being returned and complete a new sale for any new merchandise.
Please be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the Buyer, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales.
You can process a refund through your Square Account up to sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment.
If you are a Square Market Seller, you may not be able to process a partial refund.
==========
If your available Square balance is insufficient to cover the refund, Square will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your bank account.
Square will then withdraw the amount you were paid (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from your bank account, and credit it back into your Buyer’s Card.
The Fees are also refunded by Square, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your Buyer.
Square has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.
27.
Your Liability for Chargebacks
The amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Square Account (a “Chargeback”) if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the Network, our processor, or a Buyer or our financial institution, (c) was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms of this Agreement.
28.
==========
Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks
For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, we may withhold the Chargeback amount in a Reserve.
We may debit the amount of any Chargeback and any associated Fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by the Association or our processor from your Square Account (including without limitation any Reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with us.
If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Square Account.
Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a Buyer’s complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the Buyer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.
If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand.
You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of all Square Account deficit balances unpaid by you.
29.
Excessive Chargebacks
If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish controls or conditions governing your Square Account, including without limitation, by (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, and (d) terminating or suspending the Services.
30.
==========
Contesting Chargebacks
You agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Services.
To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the Buyer, the Buyer’s financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback.
We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback.
If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds to your Square Account.
If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in this Agreement.
You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback.
We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.
31.
==========
Our Set-off Rights
To the extent permitted by law, we may set off against the Balances for any obligation you owe us under this Agreement, including without limitation any Chargebacks.
All Fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds and thereafter from the Balance in your Square Account.
If you owe us an amount that exceeds your Balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your Square Account or any connected Square Account (as well as set off against any Balance in any connected Square Account).
==========
Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of this Agreement.
You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.
32.
==========
Dormant Square Accounts
If there is no activity in your Square Account (including access or payment transactions) for at least two years, consecutively, and you have a Balance, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address associated with your Square Account and give you the option of keeping your Square Account open and maintaining the Balance, withdrawing the Balance, or requesting a check.
If you do not respond to our notice within thirty days, we will automatically close your Square Account and escheat your funds in accordance with applicable law, and if permitted, to Square.
33.
==========
Square Processing Errors
We will attempt to rectify processing errors that we discover.
If the error resulted in your receipt of less than the amount to which you were entitled, Square will credit your Square Account for the difference.
If the error results in your receipt of more than the amount to which you were entitled, Square will debit the extra funds from your Square Account.
Square will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error.
Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

==========
Disputes
If a dispute of any kind arises, we want to understand and address your concerns quickly and to your satisfaction.
Please contact the Square Support with any dispute.
If we cannot resolve your concerns, we agree to an informal and inexpensive dispute resolution process requiring individual arbitration.
51.
==========
Binding Individual Arbitration
You and Square agree to arbitrate all Disputes.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly.
Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.
ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ONLY BE ON A INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be a class arbitration).
All Disputes shall be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) or JAMS (www.jamsadr.org) according to this provision and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum.
Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration.
==========
The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies.
If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county or parish where you reside.
Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, or another mutually agreeable location.
==========
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
For any Dispute, Square will pay all the arbitration fees.
If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may recover those fees from the arbitrator.
For any claim where you are seeking relief, Square will not seek to have you pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Square also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of Square services.
Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.
52.
Governing Law
This Agreement and any Dispute will be governed by California law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction.
53.
Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute
Unless otherwise required by law, an action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.
54.
==========
Right to Amend
We have the right to change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time, and to change, delete, discontinue, or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Services with notice that we in our sole discretion deem to be reasonable in the circumstances, including such notice on our website at squareup.com or any other website maintained or owned by us for the purposes of providing services in terms of this Agreement.
Any use of the Services after our publication of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as modified.
However, any Dispute that arose before the modification shall be governed by the Agreement (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that was in place when the Dispute arose.
55.
Assignment
This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Square without restriction.
56.

==========
Other Provisions
Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, these terms are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Square, and they describe the entire liability of Square and its vendors and suppliers (including processors) and your exclusive remedy with respect to your access and use of the Services.
In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any other Square agreement or policy, this Agreement shall prevail on the subject matter of this Agreement.
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
Headings are included for convenience only, and shall not be considered in interpreting this Agreement.
==========
The Agreement does not limit any rights that Square may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws.
Square’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.
58.
Survival
