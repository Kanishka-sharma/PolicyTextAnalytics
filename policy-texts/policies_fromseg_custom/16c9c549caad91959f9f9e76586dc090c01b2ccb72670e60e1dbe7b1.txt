article
"Barbed Wire Fences in Cyberspace: The
    Threat Posed by Calls for Ownership of Transactional Information",
    article by David Johnson.
Excerpt: "Concerned about the threat to
    privacy created by such electronic dossiers, some have called for new
    laws granting each of us "ownership" of all the transactional
    information generated as we move around the network...This may produce
    a sort of cattle drive vs. sheep herder battle on the electronic
    frontier.
Either "information wants to be free" or we can all put
    barbed wire around the tracks we leave -- but we can't have both a
    free information range and a system of information ownership.
The
    First Amendment implications of any such privacy regime are staggering."

"Electronic Communications Privacy: Good
    Sysops Should Build Good Fences", article by David Johnson.
Excerpt:
    "Congress was right to make the extent of electronic privacy
    protection depend substantially on context-any other approach would have
    interfered with open access to communications intended to be publicly
    disseminated.
But the result of this approach is that every system
    operator ("Sysop") of an electronic communications system or remote
    computing service bears an added burden-a duty to make clear to all
    concerned which types of messages may be disclosed to others and
    which may not."
