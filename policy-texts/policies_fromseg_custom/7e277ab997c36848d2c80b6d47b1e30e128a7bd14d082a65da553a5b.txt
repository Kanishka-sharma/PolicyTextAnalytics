NBA.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control.
The servers for NBA.com are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility.
Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks, and restricting access to information on our servers.

In addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials and if asked to disclose it by subpoena, court order or other legal process.
