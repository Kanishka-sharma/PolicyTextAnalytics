Schwab's Privacy Policy - A Commitment to Your Privacy (Effective July 2, 2007)
At Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") our most important asset is our relationship with you.
We are honored that you have entrusted us with your financial affairs, and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of information we maintain about you.

CyberTrader, Inc., a broker-dealer for active traders 

Many clients within the Schwab family of companies do business with more than one affiliate, creating an efficient, comprehensive financial relationship to meet individual needs.

We provide access to information about you to outside companies and other third parties in certain limited circumstances, including:
 

to help us process transactions for your account; 
when we use another company to provide services for us, such as printing and mailing your account statements; 
when we believe that disclosure is required or permitted under law.
For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, to perform credit/authentication checks, or for risk control; 
when we enter into a joint marketing agreement with another financial institution in order to provide you with a Charles Schwab & Co.-branded (or other Schwab affiliate-branded) financial product or service.
We only make such agreements with companies that we believe can help us provide a financial product or service that will benefit you.
