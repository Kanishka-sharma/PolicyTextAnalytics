When You Make It Public 
Personal information you submit to a CR publication or elect to post in a public area of a digital service is public.
And because of the way the Internet works, it is likely public forever.
If you submit user reviews, those submissions may also be shared by us with other websites or we may provide links to your submissions from other websites.
You may also choose to share information about yourself and your experience on our websites, such as the content you view, with third-party social networking sites.
==========
Please keep this in mind when deciding what information you want to share publicly.
If you don’t want people to know your name, email address, or other information that identifies you personally, do not include that information in your public posts.
Additionally, please go to the Choice/Opt-Out section to learn more about how you can opt out of certain of our information-sharing practices.

Sharing With Our Affiliates 
We may share your information among our corporate affiliates, which are related legal entities.
Sharing for Consumer Policy and Mobilization Purposes 
When you participate in one of our consumer policy campaigns, for example, by signing a petition or sending a message to policy decision-makers or corporations, we pass along to the petition or message recipient certain of your personal information with your message, including your first and last name and state of residence.
Communications to government officials, government agencies, and decision-makers may require you to include certain of your personal information, such as your name and street address, with your message.
Petitions and comments (including the personal information you submit with them) filed with government agencies and officials are a matter of public record and may be viewable online after being submitted to the docket.
If you have shared information about yourself and your experiences with a particular consumer product, service or consumer issue, we may also share certain personal information such as your first name and state of residence when disclosing your experiences to policymakers, fellow consumers and groups and the media (unless you have asked us to keep your first name and state private).

Sharing For Fundraising Purposes 
We may share donor information among our corporate affiliates.
We may also share certain donor data (such as full name, mailing address and donation information, but excluding your email address, telephone number(s) and any financial account information) with other organizations.
Please note:
If you became a customer of Consumer Reports before January 3, 2013, and make a donation directly to Consumer Reports, none of the information from that donation is rented or exchanged with any other company or organization.
Sharing For Marketing Purposes 
For users located in the U.S. and Canada, we may share certain information about you with other companies that offer products or services through direct-mail and other channels if you purchased or subscribed to one of our print publications on or after August 1, 2014.
If you prefer not to receive these offers, you can opt out.
==========
To do so, please go to Choice/Opt Out for instructions.
Please note that if you are an existing customer and have been continuously since before August 1, 2014, and you receive Consumer Reports magazine or our print newsletters or purchase any of our print publications either by mail, phone, or online, we may exchange or rent your name and mailing address (but not your email address) with other companies that offer products or services through direct-mail.
We screen all such offers and strive to select trustworthy, reputable companies which offer high quality products or services of interest to you.
Each mailing list exchange or rental limits the recipient company's use to one promotional effort only.
If you prefer not to receive these offers, please go to Choice/Opt Out for instructions.
