The scope of this document is limited to:
         i.            the situation where visitor is exposed to WebAds ad serving technology
       ii.
the WebAds Publisher Network
     iii.

==========
3 Data processing and storage
3.1 IP address
An IP address is the virtual location in an IP network where the visitor can be reached.
There is no direct relationship between IP address and geographic location.
An IP address is analogous to a post office box.
An IP address is considered personal data since the number of persons addressable with the IP address is limited.
3.1.1 data use
Visitors in our network expose their IP address to WebAds.
This happens when a visitor places a HTTP request to one of our webservers.
WebAds does not process IP addresses for purposes other than:
         i.            addressing its responses to HTTP requests
       ii.
==========
financial bookkeeping
     iii.
fraud prevention
3.1.2 storage
When visitors expose their IP address to one of WebAds' webservers, it is stored in the logs of the webserver.
3.1.3 legal grounds for data processing and storage
Since the IP address is necessary for a webserver to deliver a proper response to the visitor upon request, the request is considered implicit consent to process and store the IP address in the webserver.
Since the IP address is evidence of delivery fulfilment and in the prevention of fraud with bot nets and other forms of non-human traffic, WebAds has legitimate interest in processing and storing IP addresses.
The interests of the visitor are balanced against this legitimate interest by restricting the retention period as set out in article 5.2.
3.1.4 data recipients
The IP address is not shared with other recipients.
3.1.5 exposure to third parties
The IP address is not shared with third parties.
==========
3.2 Ad unit recency
An ad unit is a portion of a website reserved for advertisements.
Ad unit recency consists of a unique identifier, a date and time on which a user was last exposed to that specific ad unit.
3.2.1 data use
Some ad units are more intrusive to the user experience than others.
To balance ad monetization and user experience, WebAds limits the frequency of ad units by calculating the amount of time that passed since the last time a visitor was exposed to a specific ad unit.
==========
3.2.2 storage
Ad unit recency is stored client side in the cookie of the page the visitor visits.
3.2.3 legal grounds for data processing and storage
From the ad unit recency, it can be derived when a visitor last visited this website.
This is a form of behavioural profiling.
==========
WebAds seeks consent to use and store recency from the visitor through its Consent UI or 3rd party Consent Management Provider.
Withholding consent will disable frequency and recency control, resulting in more and more intrusive ads.
3.2.4 data recipients
Ad unit recency is not actively shared with other recipients.
However, with some effort data stored in the cookie of the page can be accessed by anyone with access to the main document.
3.2.5 exposure to third parties
Ad unit recency is not actively shared with other third parties.
==========
However, with some effort data stored in the cookie of the page can be accessed by anyone with access to the main document.
