ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Top


              YOU SHOULD READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
Scope: You and Branch agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.
==========
Initial Dispute Resolution: You may contact us at info@branch.io to address any concerns you may have regarding the Discovery Services.
Branch is able to resolve most concerns quickly to our users’ satisfaction.
==========
You and Branch agree to use best efforts through Branch’s internal dispute resolution processes to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations, which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the initial dispute resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the exceptions and terms set forth below.
Except as set forth below, any claim that you might have against Branch must be resolved through binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) using its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by AAA and resolved by a single arbitrator.
==========
The AAA rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitrator is bound by the Terms herein.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms, you and Branch are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.
In the absence of this arbitration provision, you and Branch might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.
==========
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing.
For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America.
==========
You and Branch further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Northern District of California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
Costs of Arbitration: Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against Branch and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then Branch will advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then Branch will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse Branch for all such cost and expenses that Branch paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.
==========
Class Action Waiver: YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BRANCH WILL EACH ARBITRATE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS.
This means that you and Branch may not join a claim with any other person or entity, and there shall not be authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions in this section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
==========
Exceptions: Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (meaning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
==========
Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Branch Metrics, Inc., 1400 Seaport Blvd, Building B, 2nd Floor, Redwood City, CA 94063.
The notice must be sent within 30 days of November 15, 2018, or your first use of the Discovery Services, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Branch also will not be bound by them.
==========
Changes to this Section: Branch will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by updating these Terms, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are using the Discovery Services.
Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are updated on these Terms or sent to you.
Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.
If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Discovery Services.
==========
Governing Law.
These Terms and all matters arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions; excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
Venue.
Any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms and not subject to arbitration shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the Northern District of California.
==========
You and Branch hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, those courts in any such legal action or proceeding.
Service of Process.
You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
==========
No Waiver.
Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.
Assignment.
==========
These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Branch’s prior written consent.
Branch may transfer and assign any of its rights and obligations under these Terms freely and without consent.
==========
Statute of Limitations: You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or relating to the Discovery Services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.
Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
==========
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this statute of limitations shall not apply to residents of New Jersey.
Section Headings: The section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
==========
Entire Agreement.
These Terms, together with the Discovery Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or additional terms and conditions or policies governing use of the Discovery Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Branch concerning the Discovery Services.
==========
Except as explicitly stated herein, if any provision of the Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.
NOTE FOR EU RESIDENTS: If are a consumer and have your habitual residence in the EU, depending on the laws in your country, the following may apply: You additionally enjoy the protection afforded to you by mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence.
We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Terms in California or in the EU country in which you live.
==========
