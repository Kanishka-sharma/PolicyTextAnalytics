Definitions
Cookies
A cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data file placed on a device.
Cookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as "browser cookies"), HTML5, or Adobe Flash.
For more information on third-party cookies that we use for analytics, please review the table of cookies and tracking technologies within this Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy.
==========
Web Beacons
Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1×1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") can be included in our online service’s pages and messages.
Web beacons are invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
==========
Deterministic Finger-printing Technologies
If a user can be positively identified across multiple devices, for instance, because the user has logged into a platform such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo or Twitter, it can be "determined" who the user is for purposes of improving customer service.
Probabilistic Finger-printing
Probabilistic tracking depends upon collecting non-personal data regarding device attributes like operating system, device make and model, IP addresses, ad requests and location data, and making statistical inferences to link multiple devices to a single user.
Note that this is accomplished through proprietary algorithms owned by the companies performing probabilistic finger-printing.
Note also that in the EU IP Addresses are personal information.
Device Graph
Device graphs can be created by combining non-personal data regarding use of smartphones and other devices with personal log-in information to track interactions with content across multiple devices.
==========
"Unique Identifier Header (UIDH) is the address information that accompanies Internet (http) requests transmitted over an ISP’s wireless network.
For example, when a customer types on his or her phone the web address of a retailer that request travels over the network and is delivered to the retailer's website.
The information included in that request includes things like the device type and screen size so that the retailer site knows how to best display the site on the phone.
==========
The UIDH is included in this information, and can be used as an anonymous way for advertisers to be able to determine that the user is part of a group that a third-party advertiser is attempting to reach.
It is important to note that the UIDH is a temporary, anonymous identifier included with unencrypted web traffic.
We change the UIDH on a regular basis to protect the privacy of our customers.
We do not use the UIDH to collect web browsing information and it does not broadcast individuals' web browsing activity out to advertisers or others."
Embedded Script
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the online service, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the online service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
==========
ETag, or Entity Tag
A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.
If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.
Used in this manner ETags are a form of device identifier.
ETag tracking generates unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
Unique Device Tokens
For each user that accepts push notifications in mobile apps, the app developer is provided with a unique device token (think of it as an address) from the app platform (e.g., Apple and Google).
Unique Device ID
The unique series of numbers and letters assigned to your device
