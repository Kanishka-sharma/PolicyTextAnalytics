pbs.org Privacy Policy



Nothing is more important to us than protecting the private information of our visitors.
From the pbs.org homepage to more than 150,000 pages of content produced by our affiliates, the "pbs.org" domain remains a safehaven.
All PBS-affiliated web sites adhere to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your—and your children's—personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information) and preserving the integrity of this online medium.
Gathering and Use of Information

We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis.
In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable information.
This could be in connection with the following:
contest or sweepstakes registration
subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters)
requests for membership information to local television stations
transactions in shopPBS
content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting
PBS Online will not willfully disclose your personal information to any third party without first receiving your permission.
pbs.org may use your personally identifiable information for activities explained above, for internal and marketing promotional purposes, or when shopPBS customer mailing lists are made available to carefully screened companies whose products or services might interest individuals who have shopped on the PBS web site (this is the only case where such information is provided to third parties, at your approval).
==========
We will always explain the extent of its use at the time you are asked to provide personal information.
If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply "opt out."
Under certain circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities for which personal information is needed, as in contests.
==========
Tracking and Use of Cookies


Special computer code allows pbs.org to track user activity on our site.
This computer code, when implemented, is called a "cookie."
pbs.org uses cookie technology through our localization options.
When you enter your zip code and then select your station, a cookie will assign you a unique number (with no meaning whatsoever outside the customization process) that recalls this information each time you visit.
As a result, you are able to customize your browsing experiences for your local PBS station, putting your local public television schedule, community events, calendars and a link to your local station site at your fingertips every time you visit pbs.org.
At no time will this cookie reveal to others your name, e-mail address, street address, or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of pbs.org).
Please note that if you arrive at PBS.org from a local station Web site, you will be automatically localized to that station.
If you wish to change your local station preference, please visit Station Finder.

PBS Kids Privacy Policy


Because PBS Kids speaks to a special audience, web sites that provide components for children must follow additional guidelines above and beyond the pbs.org policies.
