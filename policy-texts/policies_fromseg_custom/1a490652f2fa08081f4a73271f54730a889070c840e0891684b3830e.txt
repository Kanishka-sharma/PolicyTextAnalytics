Law Enforcement Information Requests
At Rackspace Technology, we understand that transparency about the types of requests we receive from law enforcement and similar government agencies is critical to earning and maintaining the trust of our customers.
Furthermore, law enforcement helps ensure that our customers’ data as well as our technology remains safe and free from abuse or exploitation.
We believe there is a need to strike a balance that both enables effective law enforcement and provides strong privacy protections.
==========
Once a year, we publish the number of legal demands for customer data that we receive from law enforcement agencies around the world.
While this report covers law enforcement requests, Rackspace Technology follows the same principles for responding to government requests for all customer data.
Government requests for customer data must comply with applicable laws.
A subpoena or its local equivalent is required to request non-content data, and a warrant, court order, or its local equivalent, is required for content data.
==========
Rackspace Technology offers strong encryption as one of the many security features available for purchase.
We give our customers the option to manage their own encryption keys.
==========
We do not support legislation that would prohibit or weaken the security or encryption technologies that would have the effect of weakening the security of the services, products or systems that Rackspace Technology offers to our customers.

Intracompany Data Processing
As a global company, there may be times when Rackspace Technology may need to share personal data across its entities to support our customers and employees in the provision of services.
The EU regulations on data protection (for example, the General Data Protection Regulation) require Rackspace Technology to have in place an appropriate method to legitimise cross border transfer of personal data.
Rackspace Technology has put in place an Intracompany Data Processing Agreement to allow the processing of personal data among its entities.
