Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies.

More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:

Strictly Necessary Cookies

They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.
