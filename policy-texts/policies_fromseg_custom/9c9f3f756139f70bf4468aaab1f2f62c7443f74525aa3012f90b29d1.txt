Behavioral Targeting
The website you are accessing uses a retargeting system provided by Ligatus GmbH, Hohenstaufenring 30-32, D-50674 Cologne, E-mail: info@ligatus.com (hereinafter "Ligatus") to optimise the quality of the advertising shown to you.
==========
The aim of this system is to show you only adverts that may be of interest to you.
Ligatus takes the protection of your personal data very seriously!
Ligatus GmbH has voluntarily undertaken to comply with the market-standard OBA Framework of EDAA / IAB Europe.
==========
As a German company, the protection of your data is a priority for Ligatus.
For this reason, Ligatus only uses anonymised data to improve advert quality.
As a result, neither Ligatus nor the respective operator of our partner's website you are visiting may identify you in any way.
You can yourself decide at any time whether you would like to continue seeing personalised banner from Ligatus.
==========
By issuing this data protection declaration we want to disclose to you more transparently how retargeting works, what data is collected, how and for what purposes this is used and how you can decline or suppress the use of retargeting functions at any time
a) How retargeting works in detail:
When visiting the website of one of our partners, a cookie file is stored on your computer.
Cookies are small text files that contain a single character string as a means of identification.
The cookie does not store your IP address or any data that allows you to be identified.
The next time you visit one of our partners' websites, only the character string is read which identifies the Internet browser you are using.
This allows us, for example, to identify which page you have accessed for our partner and which advert you have been shown, without this being linked to your identity.
==========
Furthermore, all of the cookies created by us are given an expiry data and automatically expire after no more than 24 months.
Important: Using cookies we cannot ever collect your personal data.
For example, when you enter an email address or delivery address, or any other personal data, we cannot see your input and cannot therefore process or store it.
We do not know your name, address or workplace, nor do we know your gender, age, email address or any other personally identifiable information about you.
Even the IP address of your computer is not stored!
You can view the data stored in the cookie on your computer.
Please refer to to your web browser’s help directory or your web browser’s FAQ to learn how cookies are stored and how to read their content.
==========
The information contained within the cookie is the exact data that we can see.
Deleting the cookie allows you to delete all of the data stored by us.
Cookie technology does not allow viruses, Trojans or other harmful programs to be placed on your computer.
User data is processed exclusively in national computer centres.
==========
b) How can I check whether personalised advertising from Ligatus is enabled on my computer?
Here you can check whether personalised advertising from Ligatus is enabled (“Opt-In”) or disabled (“Opt-Out”) in your computer.
c) How can I disable personalised advertising from Ligatus banners?
If you do not agree to the storing of cookies by us, you can check your cookie status at any time here and disable the storage of retargeting cookies by us and therefore decline personalised adverts from Ligatus.
This means that in future you will receive random advertising that is not targeted to your interests.
==========
Please note that the "opt-out" and "opt-in" functions offered are also controlled using cookies.
This means that deleting all cookies on your computer means that you will have to opt-out again.
Note also that we are continuously expanding our range of products.
As this will technically involve a new system, the introduction of a new opt-out may be necessary, even if you have already opted out of retargeting prior to its introduction.
==========
d) Can other forms of personalised advertising be disabled in addition to Ligatus?
The options described in this data protection declaration refer only to the custom adverts offered by Ligatus.
If you wish to disable custom advertising from other providers, you can do this via their respective websites.
There is an option to change your settings collectively for various providers under preference management on “Your Online Choices”:http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/.
