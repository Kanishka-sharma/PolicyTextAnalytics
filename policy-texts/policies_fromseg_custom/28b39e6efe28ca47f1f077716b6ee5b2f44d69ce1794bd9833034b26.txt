verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our
information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and
verify through the use of an email confirmation and second
authorization that the parent or guardian consents to the Terms of Service
and this privacy policy.
Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we
collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other
user of LiveJournal.com.

we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13
years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such
information, we will promptly delete it.
