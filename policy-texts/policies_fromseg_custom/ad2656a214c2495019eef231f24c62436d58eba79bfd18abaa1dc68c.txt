With this Privacy Policy, Semasio GmbH intends to inform about the processing of personal data for the site www.semasio.com as well as for the Semasio advertising targeting technology User Intelligence Platform (UIP):
Germany’s data protection law is regulated through the Federal Data Protection Act, the Telemedia Act (TMG) and a number of other special laws.
These laws specify precisely how personal data may be collected, saved, processed, transferred, or otherwise used.
Semasio’s business model is in compliance with these regulations.
To ensure continuous compliance, Semasio follows very closely the development of data protection regulation in Germany and Europe and reacts immediately to any changes.
Semasio runs the User Intelligence Platform.
==========
It is a technology, which turns contacts with digital media users into data points.
These contacts may be with Semasio’s own User Intelligence Platform, or the data may be sourced from 3rd parties.
From these data points information is derived and stored in anonymous user profiles, using a cookie set in the users browser for user identification.
==========
Semasio works together with partner companies to deliver advertising based on these user profiles.
Semasio only works with partner companies based on contracts and where the use of any data is secured as described below.
The protection of your personal data is of the utmost importance to Semasio, and we strictly adheres to the applicable data protection laws.
Semasio only collects personal data as described below.
The Privacy Policy also gives an overview of how data is protected, what data is collected and for which purpose.
1.
==========
Personal data and its use
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as name, telephone number, address and email-address.
We only collect personal data on this website provided to us by you, e.g. on the contact form, and only to the extent necessary for its purpose.
Your personal data will not be used for advertising purposes, unless you have given us your express consent.
Moreover, we will not transfer your personal data to any third parties without your express consent.
The transfer of personal data to public institutions and public authorities that are entitled to receive such information will only be carried out to the extent required by law or if we are obliged to do so by virtue of a court order or court ruling.
If we commission third parties to provide certain services for us, such third parties will only have limited access to personal data insofar as this is necessary to provide such services.
==========
Such third parties are bound to comply with the applicable data protection laws and our Privacy Policy while processing the personal data.
Semasio’s User Intelligence Platform does not collect personal data, but only records and collects anonymous data.
Therefore Semasio cannot attribute these data to a specific person.
The data Semasio collects is for instance information about the visited websites including those of Semasio’s cooperation partners.
The information stored is assigned to an anonymous identification number that can never reveal any personal information about the user.
==========
Even by combining the various pieces of stored information it would be impossible for Semasio to link the data to a specific person.
In particular, Semasio does not store any IP addresses of devices used by internet users to access the internet.
The personal data of internet users will not be used for advertising purposes, unless the internet user have given explicit consent.
Moreover, Semasio will not transfer personal data to any third parties without explicit consent.

The transfer of personal data to public institutions and public authorities that are entitled to receive such information will only be carried out to the extent required by law or if we are obliged to do so by virtue of a court order or court ruling.

Security of the data
Semasio protects the personal data of internet users against any unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
Semasio ensures that personal data will be stored in a controlled and safe environment, protected from unauthorized access and disclosure.
Furthermore, Semasio has implemented technical and organizational measures to assure that all saved data is secured.
3.
==========
Information/Withdrawal
At any time and without having to give any reason, every internet user can request information about the personal data stored by Semasio at no cost.
In addition, internet users are entitled to withdraw any consent at any time for future effect.
In the event of a withdrawal, Semasio will delete all personal data immediately, unless there is a legal or regulatory obligation to retain the data.

==========
Cookies
“Cookies” are small files that enable Semasio to store information related to an internet user, on the personal computer or other device while visiting a website from one of Semasio’s partners.
For example, cookies help to ascertain the frequency of use and the number of website’s visitors in order to design offers and services as comfortable, efficient and interesting as possible for internet users.
The cookie does not do any damage to the computer of the internet user and does not spy on personal information.
In the browser settings, an internet user can deactivate or restrict the storage of cookies from defined websites.
Furthermore, the browser can be set to inform the internet user as soon as a cookie is placed.
An internet user can also delete cookies from the hard drive at any time.
However, the use of certain services may not be possible if the browser does not allow session cookies.
5.
==========
Cooperation with partners
As a responsible company Semasio also informs cooperation partners of the relevant data protection regulation, and has detailed contractual agreements with them.
Specific business terms assure that data protection regulations are understood, openly communicated and followed.
However, cooperation partners are themselves responsible for adhering to the applicable data protection requirements and usually have their own privacy policies.
Semasio therefore does not take any responsibility and/or liability for this.
6.
==========
Opt Out
If any internet user does not want surfing behavior to be collected by the User Intelligence Platform, we offer an “Opt Out” and the internet user will not be exposed to personalized ad banners any more.
If an internet user already opted out, the decision can be reversed on this website at any time by selecting the “OptIn” option.
7.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Semasio will change or update this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with the new applicable data protection regulations or new relevant information achieved.
