Automatically Collected Information When you access the Website or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology, including server logs.

Disclosure We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies, web beacons, logs, and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing services and advertising to you.
Such third party entities may be obligated to use your personally identifiable information to provide the services to us.

We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or in cooperation with any governmental investigation, including upon receipt of what we believe may be a valid subpoena, whether issued by a Court that has jurisdiction over Ranker or not.
(Please note that Ranker reserves the right to assert that only the Federal District Court of the Central District of California, and the Los Angeles County Superior Court, have jurisdiction, and subpoenas from outside those jurisdictions must be "domesticated," though we are not obligated to do so.)
We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization, however, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Ranker participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Ranker's assets to which this Website relates.

Some third parties might use the DoubleClick DART cookie in the ads served on the Website.
When users visit the Website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser.
The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on our Website.

Although we may attempt to contractually limit what third party advertising companies and networks do, we have no ability to monitor or control what they do.
Recently some advertising companies and networks have been sued for allegedly using what are called local shared objects or re-spawning cookies (including by using Adobe® flash cookies).
Although we attempt to contractually require that these companies shall always allow the end-user (you) to easily and completely uninstall any means of tracking the end-user without regenerating the means of such tracking, we cannot assure that this will occur and, therefore, you consent to these types of practices.
If you would like more information about what many advertising companies and advertising networks do and to know some of your choices about not having this information used by the companies that are member of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.
We cannot assure that all of our third-party advertising companies and advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, or that they comply with the policies of the Network Advertising Initiative.

HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT SUCH INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF ANY OF OUR PHYSICAL, TECHNICAL, OR MANAGERIAL SAFEGUARDS.
