EU US Privacy Shield Compliance
The EU–U.S. Privacy Shield Framework requires companies meet stronger obligations to protect the personal data of Europeans and introduces stronger monitoring and enforcement by the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Now more than ever, companies need guidance to ensure requirements under the new framework are met.
Demonstrating EU Data Transfer compliance through EU-US Privacy Shield Self-Certification should be a critical component of your global compliance strategy.
Your customers and business partners expect you to have a legally approved solution in place and regulators require that you can demonstrate compliance.
==========
