Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements
This Site may display ads from other companies.
We also partner with third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated third party sites or apps.
Some of the ads on this Site or on third party sites or apps may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your device’s browsing activity.
For example, anonymous information collected by our ad networks or other third-party service providers across multiple sites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.
We may share your information with our service providers to permit them to recognize and serve targeted ads to you across the different devices you use.
Before we share your information, we transform, or “hash”, it so that it is not in personally identifiable form.

If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process.
