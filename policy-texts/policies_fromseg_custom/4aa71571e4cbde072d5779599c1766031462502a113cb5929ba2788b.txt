We respect the privacy of our visitors, users and partners, and are strongly committed to making our practices regarding their personal data more transparent and fair.
This Privacy Policy describes how and for which purposes we collect, store, use and disclose personal data regarding individuals who visit our Site (“Visitors“), install our App, or use our Services (“Users”); as well as personal data regarding our prospective and existing partners (“Partners“; and together with Visitors and Users, as applicable – “you“).

Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Advertising Uses
Our Services and some of our Service Providers utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other tracking technologies which help us provide, secure and improve our Services, personalize your experience and monitor the performance of our activities and campaigns.
Our Services also utilize advertising for third party services and products.
We and our advertising partners use certain data about you in order to improve our advertising practices and make the ads we deliver more effective, relevant and enjoyable, including by deploying contextual, interest-based and other types of advertising, as well as targeting, ad measurement and attribution systems.
==========
The ads and content we or our advertising partners deliver may be shown within our Services or through other channels, such as third-party websites and applications.
Such data includes your IP address, cookies, pixels and other unique identifiers, data related to your connected Social Network Account, and other demographic and interests-based information that we or our advertising partners may have received from or about you, based on your consent or another legal basis (i.e., as required in order to provide you with our respective services, or based on the legitimate interests that we described in Section 2 above).
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your data by our advertising partners and networks.
We recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information.
A list of the cookies and other tracking technologies we use, as well as additional information concerning our advertising partners and networks (and their policies), can be found here: https://www.spot.im/cookies/.
==========
While we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from a browser and recommend the use of cookies for an optimal user experience of our Services, most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.
Spot.IM supports initiatives of greater transparency and control for users, and offers the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive: If you reside in the EU and do not want to receive interest-based ads displayed by Spot.IM, you can disable the display of such ads by visiting the EDAA consumer choice page at www.youronlinechoices.eu.
You may also use the NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from other NAI-approved member companies, and for mobile opt outs, the NAI provides instructions to engage system-level opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.
Please note that opting out will not prevent you from seeing ads sourced from us on our Service or on other websites, but it will affect the types of ads that you will see.
These ads will no longer be tailored to your interests and instead will be chosen based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e. contextually based ads).
Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually.
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the EDAA consumer choice page, your-opt out may not be effective.
==========

If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on our Partner’s behalf, please contact such Partner directly.
For example, if you are an end-user of our Partner who wishes to access, correct, or delete data processed by Spot.IM on behalf of such Partner, please direct your request to the relevant Partner.
