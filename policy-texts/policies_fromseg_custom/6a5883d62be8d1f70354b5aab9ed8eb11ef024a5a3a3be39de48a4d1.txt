Scope of This Notice
The goal of this Privacy Notice is to advise you of the online privacy practices of kodak.com and kodakgallery.com.
The Privacy Notice also describes the choices you have about the information collected on these sites and how it is used.

If you indicate your residence is outside the U.S., you may be offered a privacy notice that is specific to your country of residence.

In such case, Kodak is operating this site for itself as well as a service provider for its global affiliates.
On our co-branded sites (such as those sites where Kodak has presented content together with one of our retail partners) a privacy notice unique to that site may be presented.
Private sites (such as those only available to dealers and distributors) and sites created for our employees (or prospective employees) may also have privacy notices unique to those sites.
Sites maintained by Kodak subsidiaries and affiliates, although linked to kodak.com or kodakgallery.com, may have their own online privacy notices.
==========
Your Personal Information
Kodak's primary goals in collecting personal information about you are, first, to give you a meaningful, enjoyable, and personalized website experience and, second, to facilitate the development of new products and services relevant to consumers like you.
Personal information also allows us to provide better service to you by tailoring our communications to match your interests- deliver more of what you want and less of what you don't want.
Here are the types of information we gather.
Information You Explicitly Provide:
In order to establish your account, register products, or to participate in various online programs offered through kodak.com or kodakgallery.com, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information to us such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number.
If you choose to purchase products or services, you will be asked to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date along with billing and shipping address information.
You can choose not to provide this information but then you might not be able to participate in some of our services or offerings.
==========
If you use OpenID: Some portions of our sites allow you to sign-in using “OpenID” technology.
This means that these sites will allow you to log on using an identity that is managed and verified by another company (an “identity provider”), such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo! or Windows Live ID, and then access a secure part of our site without an additional username and password.
However, that identity provider will share certain information about you with Kodak.
This data could include your full name, photograph, street address (including country and postal code), phone number, unique OpenID identifier, preferred username, gender, date of birth, email address, and time zone.
==========
You should review your privacy settings on these other sites, which often allow you to limit the sharing of your personal information.

We also may make aggregate non-personal information available to select service providers.
==========
Subsidiaries, parent corporations and joint ventures: A subsidiary or a joint venture is an organization in which Eastman Kodak Company ("EKC") owns at least a 50% interest.
EKC is the "parent corporation" to each of its subsidiaries, including Kodak Imaging Network, Inc., which operates kodakgallery.com.
We may share your information with an EKC subsidiary or joint venture partner, with the requirement that they not transfer your information to another party for marketing purposes, or use your information contrary to your expressed choices.
Similarly, if an EKC subsidiary or joint venture shares your information with us, we will not transfer your information to another party for marketing purposes or use your information contrary to your expressed choices.
Co-branded and Partner Pages: Kodak may share information with partner companies who jointly present special offers or promotions on co-branded pages within our site.

The partner's use of any information you submit will be governed by the partner's own privacy notice, which you can review before submitting your information.
Business Transfers: Kodak reserves the right to transfer your personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets.
If the business is sold or transferred, Kodak will give you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your personal information.
==========
In some cases, this may mean that the new organization will not be able to continue providing to you the services or products that Kodak provided.
Law Enforcement: Kodak may disclose personal information to third parties without your consent for any of the following reasons: to comply with any law, regulation or court order, to cooperate with Government investigations, to help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights of Kodak or its subsidiaries.
With Your Consent: In all other cases, Kodak will obtain your express consent before sharing your information with third parties.
For example, Kodak may conduct a joint offer or contest with a third party and you will be asked whether your personal information should be shared with that third party.
==========
Your Affirmative Choice to Share Albums, Comments, and Address Book
If you invite visitors to see your photos, by clicking on the "Share Photos" tab or using the auto-alert feature of the Gallery Premier Service, Kodak will send an email to your list of invitees containing the URL to your album.
Please note that your invitees can then forward the email containing the URL to other parties, if they choose.
If you choose to have the recipients of your album invitations sign in to view your album, then the email address your invitee provides will appear in your guestbook for that album (and, conversely, if you are invited to view an album, the email address you provide will appear in the author's guestbook).
If your invitee forwards your email invitation to another party, the email address given by that party will appear in your guestbook as well.
Kodak uses the email addresses provided (including those in your address book) only to facilitate your photo sharing activities and for no other purpose.
We will not use the addresses described in this section for any other purpose and will not disclose the addresses you provide to any third party.
==========
If you post a comment to a gallery established by a member who subscribes to the Premier Service, you understand and agree that anyone with access to the gallery will be able to access, use and/or disclose any information that you include in any such comment (including, without limitation, any personal information such as your name, e-mail address, etc.), unless you select the option to restrict your comment to only the gallery owner.
If you do not want the public (or in the case of password-protected galleries, people with access to the password) to be able to access your comments, you should select the option to restrict access to the owner.
If you choose to share your Gallery photos via third party services, access to and use of the photos and the information you provide to the third party service will be governed by the terms of the third party services, and the password protections you established on Gallery may/will not apply.
Kodak Imaging Network is not liable for any access to, use of or disclosure of any photos or information you provide to third party services, or on public galleries.
==========
Your Choices about Receiving E-mail
Kodak may send you e-mail about your orders or your account and in response to your questions.
Kodak and its subsidiaries may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you, unless you indicate you do not want to receive them.
We will give you an opportunity to let us know your preference regarding the receiving of promotional e-mail when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal information, or when we send you e-mail.
If you choose not to accept this promotional e-mail, you may not receive special offers that may be of value to you.
This option applies to promotional e-mail only, as we may find it necessary to send you e-mail relating to the products you have purchased or registered, your account or your order(s).
Promotional e-mail that you receive from Kodak will tell you how to decline receiving future promotional e-mail.

Children's Privacy

Kodak does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13, except with their parent's express consent.
If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended site audience, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice; and we will provide processes to obtain parental approval, provide access to information and allow parents to request removal of their children's personal information.
