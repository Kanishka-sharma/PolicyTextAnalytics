Ads delivered on these sites may be delivered from participants in the Digital Advertising Alliance's (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program, whose goal is to provide you with enhanced notice about online advertising practices and choices about the ads you see.
Advertising enables us to provide the rich content for which our sites are known.
In order to provide a more relevant online experience, some of the ads that you see on our sites are customized based on your previous online activity on our sites and other sites.

This information may be used to predict your interest in future ads related to those interests.
This advertising practice is called online behavioral advertising (OBA).
Our hope is that by presenting ads relevant to your interests, we will enhance your experience across the network's diverse websites.

You can opt out from receiving ads relevant to your interests from "third parties" that participate in the DAA program and are identified on their opt-out page.
If you elect to opt out of OBA, you will still receive the same number of ads as before, but they may not be as relevant to you.
==========
Please note that the opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied.
If you delete your browser cookies and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based ads, you will need to opt out again.
