Sharing Personal Information
We may disclose your personal information to a third party (i.e., our Partners) for a business purpose.

Categories of information we collect about you (e.g., identifiers such as your name, Social Security number, IP address, email address, postal address, commercial information such as purchasing histories, geolocation data, biometric information, internet activity such as web browsing histories, and professional or employment-related information);

==========
The CCPA also requires that if you request access to your information, we provide you with responsive materials in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit your information from one (1) entity to another without hindrance.
Deletion of Your Personal Information
The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers (i.e., Partners) delete your personal information.
However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons:

if we need your information to complete the transaction for which it was collected;
to comply with a legal obligation;
to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code § 1546 seq.), as amended;
to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
to identify and repair errors that impair existing and intended functionality; or
to make other internal and lawful uses of your information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Once we receive and confirm your request, we will delete (and direct our Partners to delete) your information from our records, unless otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation.
==========
Opting Out of the Sale of Your Information
Under the CCPA, you may opt out of the sale of your personal information to third parties.
To help you exercise this right, a DAA “CA Do Not Sell My Info” link is available on our homepage.
Clicking on the link will allow you to opt out of the sale of your personal information, including its use for interest-based advertising, across all companies participating in the DAA’s mechanism.
Nondiscrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
==========
We will not:

Deny you services;
Charge you different prices or rates for services by granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
Provide you a different level or quality of services; or
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services.
Who May Exercise Your CCPA Rights
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State who you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your information.
Verifying Consumer Requests
We may deny the request if we cannot verify your identity or your authority to make the request or confirm that the requested personal information relates to you.
A verifiable consumer request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are in fact the California resident or household about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
You do not need to create an account with us to submit a verifiable consumer request – simply contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing, Format, and Fees
We will respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt or as permitted by law.
==========
If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you in writing (email permitted) of the reason(s) and extension period in writing.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding our receipt of the verifiable consumer request.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive.
If we reasonably determine that the request requires a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and give you a cost estimate in writing before completing your request.
How to Submit Requests
Submit your requests to the information listed in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.
==========
Shine The Light Law
Separate from the CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, as amended, also known as the “Shine The Light” law gives California residents the right to request and obtain what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for such third parties to directly market their services to you.
If you have any questions about our Shine The Light Law practices, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.
==========
Do Not Track
California law requires us to tell you how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.
DNT allows users a way to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
