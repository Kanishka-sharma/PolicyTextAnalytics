PCWorld.com Privacy Policy
At PC World, we understand that privacy is important, and we've created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information.
Our policy is divided into three main sections: Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of the PC World Web site.
Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of PC World magazine.
And because PC World is owned by International Data Group (IDG) and is part of the IDG Publishing Network of technology publications, Section 3 presents the privacy policy for the IDG Publishing Network.
We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback.

Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time.
We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes.
Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.

PC World collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use the PC World Web site.
This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data.

Information we collect and how we use it
When you visit the PC World Web site, PC World collects several forms of usage data, including:
Log data.
==========
Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.
Cookie data.
When you visit the PC World Web site, PC World or one of our IDG affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"—small files containing a string of characters—to your computer to identify you as a unique user.
If you have registered with PC World, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site.
If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers.
==========
If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.
Traffic and advertising data.
Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable PC World to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented.
These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the PC World site.
Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site.
Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address.
In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the PC World Web site.

To improve the content and design of the PC World Web site.
==========

If you have provided information to PC World, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.
