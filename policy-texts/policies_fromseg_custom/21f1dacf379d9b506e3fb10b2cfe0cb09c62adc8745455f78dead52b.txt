==========
Namecheap sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms entered by users in Our Search function.
However, this tracking is never associated with individual users.
We use tracking information to determine which areas of Our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.
We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall.
This helps Us continue to improve Our services for Our users.
==========
COOKIES We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of Your computer.
The cookie itself does not contain personal information, although it will enable Us to relate Your use of this site to information that You have specifically and knowingly provided.
The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the user.
A cookie cannot read data from the user's hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

==========
As stated above, We use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters & marketing communication.

Namecheap creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners.
This enables Our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows Our users to receive advertisements that are tailored to their needs.
Because We don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know which particular user clicked their advertisement.

This is essential to keeping Our select services free.
We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except in order to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of Our users or the public.
