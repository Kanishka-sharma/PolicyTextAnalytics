Our Commitment to Privacy.
Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. ("Britannica") is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to  its family of Web sites (collectively, the "Britannica sites" and  each, a "Britannica site").
Except as otherwise provided, this Privacy  Policy applies to all of the Britannica sites, which include, but are not  limited to, Britannica.com,  Store.Britannica.com and EB.com.
To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online  information practices and the choices you can make about the way your  information is collected and used at this Britannica site.
The Britannica sites are general audience Web  sites, intended for Users of all ages.
Personal information of Users may be  collected, used, and disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy.
The Information We Collect.
To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest  quality services, we collect and apply information from our interactions with  visitors and subscribers (each a "User") to the Britannica sites, as  well as from other parties.
Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures  to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and  responsible manner.
==========
The information we receive and collect depends on what a  User does when visiting one of the Britannica sites.
Your Personal Information.
In general, our Users are able to visit many  of our Web pages without telling us who they are or revealing any information  about themselves.
As discussed under "Usage  Data" below, we may track the Internet domain or "Internet  protocol" addresses from which Users visit us and analyze this data in the  aggregate to determine usage for trends and statistics.
Individual Users will  remain anonymous, unless they voluntarily tell us who they are.
==========
There may be times, however, such as when subscribing to our services, making purchases from the Britannica Store, or contributing content to a Britannica site, when we ask Users to provide certain Personal Information about themselves.
"Personal Information" may include, but is not limited to, the name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit or charge card information of a Britannica site User.
Whether or not a User provides such information is completely his or her own choice.
If a User chooses not to provide the Personal Information we request, he or she may be unable to access certain services and content on our Britannica sites, purchase products from us, or contribute content to a Britannica site.
==========
Demographic Information.
There will also be opportunities for  subscribers to provide us with demographic or profile information regarding  their preferences and interests.
This information may include, but is not  limited to, age, gender, household income, level of education completed, number  of children in the household, and personal-interest information.
This  demographic information, however, is not required and is completely optional on  a subscriber's part.
==========
Prospect and Referral Information.
If a User visits a Britannica site and  submits an e-mail address to Britannica but fails to complete the registration  or purchase process, we may use such "prospect" information to  contact the prospective User from time to time with Britannica offers and  information about new features, new services, and special discounts we think  the User may see as valuable.
Similarly, if a User forwards a Britannica e-mail  to a friend, we may use the "referral" information provided to  contact the friend from time to time with Britannica offers and information  about new features, new services, and special discounts we think the friend may  see as valuable.
==========
All of our "prospect" and "referral"  communications contain clearly marked opt-out instructions.
The types of  personally identifiable information that may be collected in relation to  "prospects" or "referrals" include: name and e-mail  addresses.
We do not sell or rent any contact information for such "prospects" or "referrals."
==========
Cookies and Beacons – Use by Britannica.
To help you personalize your online experience,  Britannica uses "Cookies."
"Cookies" are small files that Britannica transfers to the hard drives of Users for  record-keeping purposes.
One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a  convenience feature to save you time.
==========
For example, Cookies allow us to  recognize you when you re-enter a Britannica site so that you will not have to  log in each time you visit.
Cookies also allow us to collect  anonymous traffic data, such as the number of unique  and return visitors who use the Britannica sites.
In addition, Britannica places  Cookies with Users visiting from advertising banners and hyperlinks on other  Web sites to track the success of a particular advertising campaign or  marketing program.
==========
Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies.
If you  prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a Cookie  or, alternatively, to refuse to accept Cookies.
It is important to note that  you may not be able to use certain features on a Britannica site if you choose  not to accept Cookies.
The use of Cookies is an industry standard and occurs at  most major Web sites.
To manage browser cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings.
To manage Flash cookies, please use the Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager.
==========
A “Web beacon” is an electronic image placed in the code of a Web page.
We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one Britannica page to another and to improve site performance.
Cookies and Beacons – Use by Third Parties.
Advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to target ads served to Britannica.com.
What does it mean to "serve ads"?
==========
When you visit a Web site, your Internet browser transmits a "request" to the computer that hosts the Web site (the "host server") requesting that server to send you (or "serve") the Web page that you are seeking.
Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers.
Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and networks of advertisers to whom we have sold the ad spaces.
The advertisers and networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency, and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising ("targeting").
These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another Web site using the same advertising network, the network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network.
Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as "behavioural advertising."
Britannica.com using cookies or beacons.
==========
Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you on other sites.
If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org.
Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
==========
You can learn more and opt out of receiving targeted ads from them at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below.
When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an "opt-out" cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.
You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads.
If you erase your browser's cookies, you may need to perform this process again.

How We Use the Information We Collect.
==========
We want you to understand when and with whom we may  share personal or other information we have collected about you or your  activities on our Web sites or while using our services.
Personal Information.
Britannica uses Personal Information for: allowing Britannica site Users to obtain an account and to receive communications they request; verifying the identities of contributors of content to Britannica sites; making ongoing enhancements to the Britannica sites; marketing and promotional purposes; and evaluating Web site usage by analyzing and otherwise using Personal Information and related data in the aggregate, but not with respect to any individual Britannica site User.
==========
In addition, with respect to Britannica site Users located outside North America, we may share pertinent Personal Information with our local subsidiaries.
We do not share your Personal Information  with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an  opportunity to opt out of having your Personal Information shared.
We may share  Personal Information with: 



Authorized service providers.
We may share  your Personal Information with our authorized service providers that perform  certain services on our behalf.
These services may include fulfilling orders,  processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer  service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis,  supporting our Web site functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes,  surveys and other features offered through our Web site, catalogs, by phone or  mail.
These service providers may have access to Personal Information needed to  perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information  for any other purposes.
==========
Business partners.
When you make purchases  or engage in promotions offered through our Web site, catalogs or through our  other services, we may share Personal Information with the businesses with  which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests  and/or sweepstakes.
When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer  or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other  information to that merchant.
Direct mail partners.
From time to time we  may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services  that may be of interest to you.
If you prefer not to receive mailings from  these providers, you can notify us at any time by following the instructions  set forth below in "How to Opt Out,  Correct, Update, or Remove Personal Information."
==========
Other situations.
We also may disclose your  information:

In response to a subpoena or similar  investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law  enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal  rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
In  such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
==========
When we believe disclosure is appropriate in  connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding  illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend  the rights, property or safety of Britannica, our Users, our employees, or  others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to  enforce our Web site terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
In connection with a legal proceeding or substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale.
Britannica  does not include in any of the Britannica sites any functionality for  performing "reverse searches" to identify Web site Users from their  e-mail addresses.
However, as discussed below, Britannica reserves the right to  analyze and utilize Personal Information in order to more effectively optimize  the User experience and to present certain opportunities to Users for their  benefit.
Demographic Information.
In an ongoing effort  to improve its services, Britannica may use aggregated demographic information  to draw conclusions about Users' wishes and preferences.
Britannica may also  provide demographic information in the aggregate regarding Britannica site  Users to third parties in connection with Britannica advertising campaigns and  marketing programs; however, no demographic information relating to any  individual Britannica site User is disclosed without the express consent of  such User.
In addition, any such User may withdraw his/her consent at any time  by following the instructions provided under the heading "How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove  Personal Information" below.
As stated above, submitting such  demographic information is not required and is completely optional on a User’s  part.
==========
Prospect and Referral Information.
As discussed above,  we may use prospect and referral information to contact a prospect or referral  from time to time with Britannica offers and information about new features,  new services, or special discounts we think such prospect or referral may see  as valuable.
We do not sell or rent any contact information for such prospects  or referrals.
Usage Data.
We only use Usage Data in the aggregate.
==========
We look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis.
This data helps us determine the extent to which our visitors use certain parts of a Britannica site, which, in turn, enables us to make the Britannica sites as appealing as possible.
We may also provide statistical "ratings" about how our visitors collectively use our Web sites to business partners (advertisers and other companies with which we do business.)
We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of the Web sites in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience.
These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about any of our individual Users.
==========
Information Disclosed in Public Areas.
Certain Britannica sites allow for the sharing of information.
You should remember that any Personal Information you submit to such areas (for example, online chat rooms and forums) may be viewed by other visitors to that site.
As a result, your Personal Information may be viewed, collected and used by third parties over whom Britannica has no control.
Britannica is not responsible for either the information you submit in such public areas or the use that may be made of such information by any third party.
==========
Subscriber Communications.
As a benefit of membership, Britannica site  subscribers may receive the following communications from us:

Our Commitment to Security.

==========

The most  commonly used browsers are able to process SSL encryption.
The secure server  software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.
==========
In  addition, Britannica uses security measures in connection with the collection  and transmission of Britannica site User information during each Britannica  site's registration process.
