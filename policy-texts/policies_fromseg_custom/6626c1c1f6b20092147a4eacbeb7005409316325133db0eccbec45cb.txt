Campaign
Right now there is a lack of awareness about how extensively personal information that has been collected is used on the Net and to whom this information is shared.
Most don't realize the vast information sharing chain that exists once a company or governmental agency obtains your personal information.
==========
In some cases, personal information about you that will be shared might contain only a name and an email address.
Oftentimes though, personal information can include name, address, email address, social security numbers, URLs for web sites you've visited, as well as other information that may have been built up about you in a profile.
Why does this matter?
Aggregation of data from different sources allows others to form opinions of you, to market items to you in a specific way, or to possibly discriminate against you, based on a profile that may or may not be accurate.
==========
Unwanted disclosure of information often has similar consequences.
Consequences can range from simple embarrassment to serious problems such as harassment, violence, insurance cancellation, loss of job or home, and relationship issues with family and friends.
==========
To help raise awareness and to give you a way to fight back, EFF has launched an ongoing privacy campaign to show clearly the long, convoluted path that your personal information makes as it is shared among a myriad of organizations.
Visit our web site often and use our sample letters to inform those who share your personal information far and wide that this is no longer an acceptable business practice.
