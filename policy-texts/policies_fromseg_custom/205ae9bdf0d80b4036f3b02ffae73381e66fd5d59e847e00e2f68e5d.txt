Data is a privilege
As pioneers in location technology, we believe it is our duty and responsibility to set best practices related to data privacy and ethics.
The data we collect powers our apps and location platform and is shared with partners via analytics, audiences, data solutions, measurement, and developer tools.
Value exchange
App developers cannot use Foursquare’s contextual-aware Pilgrim SDK technology unless consumers genuinely benefit from the collection of location data.
People should benefit from having location data collected, and our tech is not available to app developers who don’t provide these benefits.
Benefits may include:
Powering local or personalized content
Personal life-logs and geo-features
Providing local discounts, offers or direct payments based on confirming visits, answering surveys and the like
Transparency and control
We know that location data is some of the most sensitive data out there.
==========
That’s why consumers must be in control.
To opt-out of sharing your location data with Foursquare, please go to Privacy Settings in your Foursquare app.
We believe mobile apps that want to collect location data need to ask permission from consumers in plain English.
Consent should not be buried within terms and conditions that only a few people read.
==========
Alerts should be clear and identify use cases.
Consumer protection
Companies should be required to apply privacy-protecting measures to data uses.
At Foursquare, we do everything we can to ensure that neither data science nor our products disadvantage or allow for the discrimination of consumers.
==========
We run important decisions through our Product Council, which includes members of our legal and privacy teams, and our contracts prohibit customers from using location data that would violate laws prohibiting discrimination or use in connection with making decisions about ineligibility for employment, credit, housing, health care treatment, or insurance.
We believe data is a privilege and we act accordingly.
Privacy for all
We hold ourselves and our partners to a high standard, but we cannot speak for the entire industry.
==========
We believe Congress must set limits to prevent bad behavior.
We are advocates for federal regulation that will protect people from unethical, unfair or opaque practices.
We believe location technology can be a tool to serve the greater good—but regulation needs to help raise the bar and protect consumer rights.
