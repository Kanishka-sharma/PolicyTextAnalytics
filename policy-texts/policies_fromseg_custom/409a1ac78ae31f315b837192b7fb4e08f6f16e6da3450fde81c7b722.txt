Discovery.com respects your privacy, and we want you to understand the ways in
which we do and don't use the information that you transmit when you visit our
Web site.
This statement discloses the privacy practices for all Discovery.com
Web sites except for areas of Discovery.com directed to children, including
Discovery Kids and the Students area of Discovery School, which have their own
policy specially developed to protect kids.
A Note to Kids
If you've left the Discovery Kids Site or the Students Area of Discovery School
and you're exploring the other places that Discovery.com has to offer — good for
you!
Do a little digging and have some fun!
==========
But remember, you should still get
permission from your parents before sending any information about yourself (such
as your name, email address and phone number) over the Internet, to us or to
anyone else.
And a note to parents: We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to
register with any of our sites or to access those features that require
registration.
Basics
The information gathered by Discovery.com falls into two categories: (1)
information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our Web sites through optional
registration and (2) tracking information routinely gathered as visitors
navigate through our sites.
To make use of certain features on our Web sites (such as My Discovery,
Discovery Travel and  the  Discovery Store), visitors need to register and to
provide certain information as part of the registration process.
(We may ask,
for example, for your name, email address, gender, age and zip code, and we might
request information on your interest in science, animals, nature, travel,
sports, books, television programs and the like.)
The information you supply
will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to
your interests and to make them more useful to you.
==========
The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you.
Supplying
such information is entirely voluntary.
But if you don't supply the information
we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to
other visitors to our sites.
==========
For example, we can't offer you online travel
reservations without knowing how to book your trip, personalized TV schedule
listings and program reminders for Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel,
Animal Planet or any of our other TV offerings if you don't tell us which
programs and topics you're interested in.
And we can't send you email alerting
you to any new service we're offering or breaking news that may interest you if
you don't tell us your preferences and give us your email address.
Similarly,
we can't notify you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize in a
promotional contest if we don't know how to contact you.
==========
Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to
take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without
registration.
For Users of DiscoveryHealth.com
We recognize that the confidentiality of medical and health-related information
is of special concern to many visitors to DiscoveryHealth.com.
Discovery is
committed to safeguarding your medical privacy.
We will not share with ANY
third party personally identifiable information relating to medical conditions
or health-related interests that you might disclose on DiscoveryHealth.com
unless you opt in to our sharing that data.
==========
Cookies
To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a
standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each
visitor a unique, random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that resides on
your computer.
The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the
computer that a visitor uses to access our site.
Unless you voluntarily identify
yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if
we assign a cookie to your computer.
The only personal information a cookie can
contain is information you supply.
==========
A cookie can't read data off your hard drive.
Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process
that we don't control.
We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better,
more personalized service.
In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages
on our sites visited by our users.
We can build a better site if we know which
pages our users are visiting and how often.
Of course, you can set your browser
not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of
the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our sites.
==========
IP Addresses
Our Web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's
connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our sites.
(Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know
where to send you data — such as the Web pages you view.)
Your IP address does
not identify you personally.
==========
We use this information to deliver our Web pages to
you upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our users and to
measure traffic within our sites.
Information Sharing and Sites Beyond Discovery.com
To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in
conjunction with other providers.
Our travel email fan clubs, for example, are
made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize
in operating such services and that will receive the information you provide
when you register for, and use, these services.
To take advantage of these
services, you may need to provide personal information to us and to the other
provider.
==========
And, of course, our sites include links to plenty of other Web sites
whose privacy policies we don't control.
Once you leave our servers (you can
tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use
of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator
of the site you're visiting.
And when you provide information in the course of
obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you
provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products
or services, even if it appears that you're on Discovery-branded pages
throughout the transaction.
That policy may differ from ours.
If you can't find
the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage,
you should contact the site directly for more information.
==========
When we present information to our advertisers — to help them understand our
audience and confirm the value of advertising on our Web sites — it is usually
in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our
sites.
From time to time, we may share information on visitors to our sites with
those marketing products and services that we believe might be of interest to
you.
Please indicate on our My Discovery registration form if you'd prefer we
not share such information with them.
If you so indicate on our registration
form, we won't share information about you with anyone other than those
identified when the information is collected.
==========
And, of course, you are always
free not to input the information we request (though this may make it impossible
for us to provide certain services we make available to other visitors to our
sites).
If you want to change your election (or review, update or delete the
information you provided on registering), just return to the registration form,
enter the changes you want to make and resubmit the form.
Sometimes, we might
also contact you directly about our own or others' products and services.
If
you'd prefer that we not do so, just indicate on your registration form that you
prefer not to receive offers and information.
And remember, you can always
change your preferences.
==========
Encryption and Security
All information gathered on any Discovery.com Web site is encrypted for storage
within a Discovery.com-controlled database.
Discovery.com seeks to safeguard
the information you provide.
As effective as encryption technology is, however,
no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the
absolute security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you
supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any
chat room, forum or other public-posting area is available to anyone with
Internet access.
If you don't want people to know your email address, for
example, don't include it in any message you post publicly.
The Discovery Store
Discovery.com knows that the confidentiality of purchase-related information is
of special concern to visitors who purchase items through DiscoveryStore.com.
Discovery.com is committed to safeguarding this information.
==========
We will not
share any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address or
telephone number) that you provide us when you make a purchase through
DiscoveryStore.com with any other company, except where necessary for the vendor
to fulfill the order.
However, to help provide you with the best possible
shopping experience, we may provide our strategic partners, vendors and
advertisers with aggregated information (information that doesn't identify
anyone personally) about those who have purchased items through the Discovery
Store.
We may also use the information you provide us when you make a purchase
through DiscoveryStore.com to tell you about new products, services and special
offers that we believe might be of interest to you.
If you would prefer not to
be contacted about such products, services or special offers, please let us know
by checking the box marked "No Special Notices" located in the checkout section
of the Discovery Store.
==========
Discovery Travel
We are committed to safeguarding the information you submit to us when you make
travel reservations and purchase travel services through Discovery Travel.
We
will not share any of the personally identifiable information (such as your
name, address or telephone number) that you provide when you request information
about a trip, make a reservation or purchase travel services through Discovery
Travel, except to the company (for example, an airline, tour operator, hotel or
travel agent such as Away.com) providing such services.
We encourage you to enjoy
Discovery Travel and all it has to offer, but please note that if you do request
information or reserve or book a trip, it is likely that one of our preferred
online travel providers will be fulfilling your request and receiving your
personal information.
==========
A Final Note:
The Web is an evolving medium.
If we need to change our privacy
policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes here.
Of course, our
use of information gathered while the current policy is in effect will always be
consistent with the current policy, even if we change that policy later.
If you
have any questions about our privacy policy, please send an email to
privacypolicy@discovery.com.
Thanks for making the Discovery.com
family of Web sites a part of your discoveries online!
