PCWorld.com will occasionally log visitors' IP addresses for the collection of aggregate information about site visitors and their interests.
PCWorld.com does not link these IP addresses to personal identifying information such as a visitor's name and/or e-mail address.
==========
What are cookies, and how are they used?
PCWorld.com will occasionally place a cookie on the visitor's hard drive in order to facilitate a user-friendly experience.
Cookies are small files that contain information a Web site uses for tracking purposes.
==========
PCWorld.com uses the cookie information it receives to improve the efficiency of customer service for subscription-based sites, allowing subscribers to easily change addresses and add or cancel subscriptions by automatically verifying subscription status.
PCWorld.com also uses cookies to enhance site content by compiling aggregate information about what specific sections and pages users visit.
==========
Advertisers or independent third parties who operate the servers on which the ads reside will occasionally also place cookies.
Although PCWorld.com encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, PCWorld.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties.
PCWorld.com also has a third party partnership with WebSite Story, which sets cookies that track Web usage of visitors.
WebSite Story does not use the information for any other purpose than statistical information shared solely with PCWorld.com.

==========
What are Clear GIFs, and how are they used?
Our Web pages contain electronic images (called "Clear GIF", "Single-Pixel Gif", or "Web Beacon") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies.
In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF.
Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files.
They are often invisible on the Web page, but their presence can be easily detected within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source."
Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content.
We also include Clear GIFs in HTML-formatted newsletters in order to count how many newsletters have been read.
==========
In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our Web sites will occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements.
Our Clear GIFs do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our Web site visitors; they are simply the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about Web site usage.
==========
What is PCWorld.com's relationship with the DoubleClick advertising network?
PCWorld.com has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on www.pcworld.com, both on the Web site itself and through its e-mail newsletters.
==========
When DoubleClick is serving ads, it recognizes certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a user's IP address, browser version or type, operating system, service provider, and time zone.
DoubleClick also uses cookies to note the general content of the sites you visit over time in order to serve ads on this site and other sites.
The pages that a user calls up on PCWorld.com and that are noted by Doubleclick are not connected with personally identifiable information collected either at PCWorld.com or elsewhere.
For more details about the non-personally identifiable information DoubleClick collects and the opportunity to opt out of such data collection, please visit http://www.doubleclick.net/naiprivacy.
Does PCWorld.com share the information it collects with others?
==========
PC World will occasionally share some of the non-identifying visitor information it collects on the site in the aggregate with third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.
However, PCWorld.com never shares personal identifying information with any third party, except in these cases:
with the individual sponsor of a contest, promotion, or sweepstakes, and only if the participant specifically asks to receive additional information from a specific sponsor and for the purposes of administering the contest and notifying the winners.
==========
with third-party intermediaries--solely for the purposes of distribution--who will not store, retain, or use the information supplied to them.
These intermediaries include subscription service bureaus, credit card companies, sweepstakes services companies, and banks, or third-party providers of PCWorld.com services that the user selects at our site.
Users are given the option to discontinue such services at any time, at which point the user's personal information will be automatically deleted from the service providers' databases.
==========
with third party billing services for magazine subscriptions.
Shared information includes credit card number and expiration date from subscribers who wish to pay for PC World print magazine subscriptions.

All such offers are carefully screened.
==========
PCWorld.com registered users and newsletter subscribers are given the option to choose whether they would like to receive such mailings upon registration and can change their choice at any time (see below).
