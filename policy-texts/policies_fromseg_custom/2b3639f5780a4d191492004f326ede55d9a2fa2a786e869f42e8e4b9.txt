We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to use it in a responsible manner.

What information do we gather?
When you visit our website and access information you can remain anonymous.
However, when you engage in certain activities on the site, such as requesting product information, downloading software, or entering contests, we might ask you to provide information about yourself such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, location and other personally identifying information.
If you purchase products from us, your credit card information will be collected and used by our payment processor solely for purposes of completing your purchase.
We do not store or use your credit card information.
Some of our products can be used by our customers to monitor activity on their networks.
If you use our products for these purposes it is your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and your internal policies relating to such monitoring, and providing notices and obtaining any necessary consents from your users.

If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that information.
If you believe we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us at privacy@nginx.com.
How do we use the information we gather?
We use the personal information we collect to provide you with products, services and information that you purchase or request, to record and support your participation in the activities you select, to provide you with information about Nginx and its products and services, and to contact you in response to your request or inquiry.
==========
We use your personal information to assist in providing the highest level of customer care.
We also will use your personal information from time to time to provide you with information about Nginx and its products and services, provide newsletters to you, and to contact you in response to your request or inquiry.

==========
We will only process your personal information in ways that are compatible with the purpose that we collected it for, or for purposes that you later authorize.
Before we use your information for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out.
We maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that EU Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
==========
Do we share your personal information with third parties, such as service providers or consultants?
Information you submit might be shared with our distribution and reseller partners who may contact you regarding our products and services.
However, if you prefer that your information not be shared with third parties, you can “opt out” of future sharing by emailing privacy@nginx.com.
Please note that it can take up to 10 days for your request to be processed and completed.
==========
We may provide information to third party service providers that help us operate and manage our Site, process orders, and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us.
These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.
In addition to the sharing described elsewhere in this Policy, we will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Nginx when we have your consent to do so.
We will share personal information with third party companies, organizations or individuals outside of Nginx if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
==========
Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Nginx, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.
If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner.
In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently.

How do we use cookies?
NGINX, Inc. uses cookies to gather information on website usage.
This information is gathered to improve the content, usability, and functionality of the site.
This helps us better understand our customers and improve their experience with us.
The following table provides additional information about cookies we use on our Site.
Categories of Use Description
Preferences, features and services Cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are.
They can help you fill out forms on nginx.com more easily.
They also provide you with features, insights, and personalized content based off other content you’ve engaged with on the site.
==========
Advertising We use cookies to show you advertising both on and off the NGINX site.
Similarly, we may work with advertising platforms who use a cookie to show you an ad off nginx.com, and to determine how the ad performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.
Performance, Analytics and Research Cookies help us learn how well our site performs in different locations, on different devices and at different times of day.
==========
Do we use your information for advertising purposes?
We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for Nginx or our advertising partners that are more relevant to your interests.
We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you.
Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests.
These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by Nginx.
We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites.
For example, cookies can be used in the selection of the advertisements that appear on a Google search results page, or at a site in the Google Display Network (that is, ad content might be based on which pages you viewed during past visits to the NGINX, Inc. website).
You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you on their Ads Settings page.
==========
You can opt out of interest-based advertising by changing cookie settings in your browser or by using a browser plug-in.
We do not control cookies used by these advertising networks.
Currently, our Site does not recognize if your browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads.
To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, the following sites are helpful:
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU)

Any physical access to the information is strongly limited.

However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

Consent to Processing of Personal Data in United States

Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information.
We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred.
Where such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as within the EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law.
By using and accessing our Site, users who reside or are located in countries outside of the United States agree and consent to the transfer to, and processing of personal information on servers located outside of the country where they reside, and that the protection of such information may be different than required under the laws of their residence or location.
