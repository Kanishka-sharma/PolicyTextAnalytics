WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
When you use the Platform and/or our Services, we collect and receive two types of data: 

● data that, alone or in combination with other data, can be used to identify you ("Personal Data").
For clarity, “Personal Data” includes any personal information, personal data or personally identifiable information as defined by the privacy or data protection laws in your jurisdiction; and 




● non-personal data that cannot be used to identify you (for example, aggregated statistical data about the use of our website, or data about a particular user that does not include any identifying data) ("Non-Personal data").
==========
For clarity, Non-Personal data does not constitute Personal Data and any collection or processing of Non-Personal data is not subject to collection, use or disclosure practices contemplated by this Privacy Policy.
Any disclosures regarding Non-Personal data made in this Privacy Policy are provided for informational purposes only.
==========
We collect and receive the following Personal Data and Non-Personal Data directly from you and
    automatically through your use of our Services:

● Data we will ask you for.
⮚ When you create a profile on our Platform, you will be required to provide the following data.
==========
Without this data, we will be unable to create an account for you or provide the Services:



create a username (a unique name of your choice) and a password,  
contact information (for example, your email address), 

your relationship status including what you are looking for from the Services (for example, if you are an attached male seeking females); and

demographic information (your city of residence, zip/postal code and date of birth for the purpose of determining your age).
⮚ When you make a purchase off our Platform you are contractually required to provide billing information including your name, address and details of your chosen payment method in order for us to be able to process your transaction.
Failure to provide this information means we will be unable to provide the requested Service/feature.
==========
⮚ At your option, you may choose to activate 2-factor authentication for your account through Nexmo, a third party provider of a user authentication service.
Nexmo’s service is based on providing you with a verification code, which you enter when logging into your Service in order to confirm your identity.
Nexmo sends verification codes by text message to a telephone number that you provide.
In order to facilitate your use of the Nexmo service, we will be required to share with Nexmo your telephone number in order to link it to your account with us, and will therefore ask for your phone number for this purpose.
==========
Note that the Nexmo service is not part of the Service, and is subject to separate terms and conditions, including different policies with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data.
We do not have control over Nexmo.
==========
You will need to make your own independent judgment regarding your interaction with them.
Please note that if you decide to delete your Ashley Madison account, we will delete your phone number from our records, but this will not effect Nexmo with respect to the phone number we provided to Nexmo on your behalf.
You will need to contact Nexmo directly with respect to management of your Nexmo account, including any deletion requests.
==========

DATA TRANSFERS

As we have a global business operation, your Personal Data will be transferred to recipients located
    in jurisdictions outside your jurisdiction of residence, and that your profile will be accessible by users all over
    the world.

    countries outside your jurisdiction of residence, including without limitation Canada and Cyprus.

Some of these
    jurisdictions do not have an equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your country however we will take
    steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within your home
    country.
In particular, if you are a resident of the European Union, whenever we transfer your data outside of
    Europe we will either: (a) ensure that the recipient is certified with the Privacy Shield Framework or that the
    country is deemed adequate by the European Commission; (b) put in place Standard Contractual Clauses or (c) implement appropriate safeguards approved by the
    European Commission to ensure an adequate level of protection in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling
    cookies or opting out of ad networks as described further in this section).
Cookies.
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s
    hard drive, through your web browser, for record-keeping purposes.
We might use cookies to uniquely identify your
    browser/device/IP address, in order to help us to process your transactions and requests, to track aggregate and
    statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Platform and on third-party
    sites.

    new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
If you disable cookies some features of our Platform may not function.
Further information may be found at www.allaboutcookies.org.
==========
Clear GIFs.
Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, though, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages, not stored on your hard drive.
==========
These “images” are automatically loaded to your browser/device when you visit our website or open an html format email message from us, thereby letting us know if a certain page was visited or an email message was opened.
Clear GIFs allow us to record simple user actions related to our websites and to email communications received from us, to help us determine the usage and effectiveness of our site and communications.
We might use clear GIFs to track the activities of our visitors and app users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage.
We and our third party service providers also might use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
These can be blocked either by using a third party application such as Ghostery (https://www.ghostery.com), or, in the case of
    emails, by changing your settings to prevent images from being downloaded (where your email client supports this
    functionality).
==========

    such as Google Analytics
        (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) (to opt out, go here
        (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) ), and AppsFlyer (to opt out, go here

    technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our Platform
    with other information that they have collected about you from your use of other sites.
