Our Services
Eyeota collects, organizes and shares only non-personally identifiable information (non PII) about users as received as non PII from website owners and other third-party data sources.
==========
This information is related to demographic, behavioral, and usage patterns of non-identifiable persons, collectively referred to as “Preference Data”.
This data reflects users’ interactions with websites and other online properties and offline businesses operated by participating companies and other third parties.
The Preference Data is analyzed to define groups and to group users based on factors such as geography, gender, age, interests and online actions into segments.
These segments are used by our partners such as online marketers and advertisers to deliver relevant and specific marketing messages or adverts (interest-based advertising), for the delivery of content to online users and for reporting activities.

Our partners are not authorized to resell our Preference Data or any related information.
Additionally, our partners are required to comply with our Privacy Policy in relation to online behavioral advertising practices across multiple unrelated websites.
Additionally, they are required to provide online users the ability to opt-out from online behavioral advertising across multiple unrelated websites.
Preference Data is also collected for internal reporting, industry reporting, and market research to obtain a better understanding online user behavior, interests and other business purposes.
How we collect information
We use online technologies such as ‘cookies’, ‘pixel tags’ and server-to-server connections with our partners to collect and store Preference Data.
==========
We do not use ‘flash cookies’ or any other embedded tracking mechanisms.
Cookies are very small files or pieces of information that are sent by a website’s server or third parties, to a user’s browser, when the user visits a website.
They are stored as text files on the user’s hard drive, to uniquely identify a browser.
These cookies and be accessed by web servers when the user returns to a website.
==========
A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that is used to track the pages viewed on a website.
Cookies do not capture personally identifiable information and cannot access any other data on a user’s hard drive or read cookie files created by other websites.
The use of cookies is an industry standard on most websites, with most browsers being set up to accept them by default.
The default browser setting may be changed to notify a web user when a cookie is sent or to prevent cookies from being placed on the user’s hard drive.
Websites use cookies to allow visitors to navigate easily, causing some websites or pages to not function properly if the cookies associated with them are rejected.
==========
Since cookies are unique to each browser on the user’s computer, changing computers or browsers, using multiple computers or browsers will require changes to each computer and each browser setting.
The mechanism to control browser settings for managing cookies varies by browser.
For information on managing cookies, check your browser’s help file.
Eyeota cookies are stored for targeting for 1 year.
==========
Pixel tags are small transparent images or invisible tags that are embedded on a web page, emails and other documents but not on the user’s computer.
They are used by website operators or third parties, serving the tag, to convey viewer data to a user’s browser or to a web operator’s log files.
When a user visits a website, the pixel tag generates a notice of the visit.
Pixel tags work in conjunction with cookies and may instruct the user’s browser to update the cookie associated with that pixel when a particular computer visits a particular page.
Pixel tags can be used to collect information about a user’s visit to a website, including the pages viewed, the features used and other actions taken in connection with the site.
This information may include but is not limited to the browser type, operating system, date and time information and other technical information about the user’s computer.
==========
It may also be used to track certain information about the identity of the website visited immediately before coming to a website.
A pixel does not allow updating of cookies or tracking of any information in relation to other websites.
Most browsers are set up initially to accept pixel tags.
==========
However, if a browser is set to reject cookies, or cookies associated with a pixel tag are deleted, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
Eyeota collects Preference Data over time from cookies associated with pixel tags that have been placed on partner websites.
Server-to-server connections are direct technical connections and integrations with Eyeota and a technology partner whereby Eyeota may obtain data from other online and offline third-party sources through various secure information transfer methods.
No personally identifiably information is transferred to Eyeota through these server-to-server connections.
Additionally Eyeota may combine its own Preference Data with that obtained from third-party sources.
