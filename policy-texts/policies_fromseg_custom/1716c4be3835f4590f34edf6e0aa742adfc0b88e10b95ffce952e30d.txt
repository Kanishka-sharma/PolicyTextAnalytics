Disclosures of personal Information.
Sales of personal information.
==========
The concept of a "sale" under CCPA is different from what has traditionally been considered a "sale", e.g., selling a customer list for money.
Under CCPA, a "sale" potentially includes other uses or disclosures of personal information to third parties outside Zulily in a commercial context (unless an exception to "sale" as provided by CCPA exists).
Because the concept of "sale" is so broad under CCPA, Zulily may be deemed to "sell" the following categories of personal information even though we may not disclose your personal information in exchange for money: identifiers; demographic data; purchase history and payment information; internet or other electronic network activity information; geolocation data; audio, electronic, visual, or similar information; your preferences and inferences about your interests; and individual records.
Disclosures for business purposes.
==========
Please note that Zulily may share your personal information with vendors that help us fulfill your transactions and provide other services to us.
Examples of these vendors include payment processors, fraud prevention services, and shippers.
We do not treat these disclosures as sales.
Zulily may disclose the following personal information to our vendors: identifiers; demographic data; purchase history and payment information; internet or other electronic network activity information; geolocation data; audio, electronic, visual, or similar information; professional or employment-related information; your preferences and inferences about your interests; and individual records.
==========

==========
