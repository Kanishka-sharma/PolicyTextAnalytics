Worried about the use of your data stored by EasyChair?This web page describes how we use your personal data.1 Use of Personal Information by Conference OrganisersWe collect data that is normally required by conference
                      organisers.
This is your name, email address, address for
                      correspondence, Web page, country, affiliation, or phone
                      number.2 Cross-Conference DataWe do not pass any personal cross-conference data.
For example,
                      when you submit a paper, we will not pass information on whether
                      this or a similar paper has been submitted before or in parallel.
We will never pass any information about reviewing in one
                      conference to organisers of another conference, even if both
                      are different instances of the same conference series.Note, however, that we cannot prevent conference organisers
                      from passing this information.3 Use of Personal Information by EasyChairThis section covers our policy on handling your data for
                      uses other than the use by conference organisers as
                      described in Sections 1 and 2.
Exceptions to this policy
                      are described in Section 4.
We do not sell, distribute, or pass your personal data
                          to any organisation.

We do not access data of any conference that uses EasyChair.
Our policy is that the only persons who have access to
                          this data are those persons who have access to it as a
                          consequence of their use
                          of EasyChair.
For example, if we store a review on a
                          submission for a conference, only the following people
                          will have access to this review: the reviewer who wrote the review; the chairs of the conference; the programme committee member who is handling the review; all programme committee members to which the chairs give
                             access to the review; the authors of the submission if the chairs decide to
                             send the review to the authors, and only after the
                             review has been sent to the authors.4 Abuse of Services Provided by EasyChair.We reserve a right to interfere in conference management or
                      access personal information only in one of the following

                          submission facilities for anything different from
                          its intended use by conference organisers.

                          EasyChair or on repeated attempts to access data
                          in unauthorised waysIn any such case of reported abuse our interference
