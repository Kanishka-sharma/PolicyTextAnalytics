Privacy and Security



The District of Columbia is committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to any of our websites through the following practices.
Collection and Use of Online Information
Our web server automatically collects your Internet Protocol (IP) address when you visit our site.
Your IP address is your computer's unique address that lets other computers attached to the Internet know where to send data, but rarely can be used to identify you individually.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to compile statistics on site usage.
We will not make your IP address available to anyone outside the District's technology staff, unless required by law to do so.
To help us provide better service and a more effective website, sections of this site may use cookies as part of its interaction with your browser.
==========
A cookie is a small text file (typically only a few bytes) that we place on your hard drive to allow our server to identify your computer.
Our cookies will not attempt to read any additional information on your hard drive, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine your identity or your email address.
In order to visit certain areas of this site, or to use certain services, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as your name, address, or gender.
If you are making a payment, we may ask for your credit card number and billing address.
==========
If you decline to provide requested information, our ability to serve you may be limited.
But you will still be able to visit the site and take advantage of the wealth of information it offers.
Secure Transmissions
Please be assured that this site is equipped with security measures to protect the information you provide us.
We encrypt credit card numbers and other data that must remain secure to meet legal requirements.
Protection of Personal Information
Your individual identifying information will not be shared, sold, or transferred to any third party without your prior consent, or unless it is required by law.

It is available to District web development employees only for the purpose of maintaining the DC.Gov web portal and improving the site visitor experience.
