We display this Privacy Statement to make you aware of the information practices for Trimble Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.
We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time to stay current with changes in our business and to better serve you.
A notice will be posted on our Web site home page whenever this Privacy Statement is amended so that you can inform yourself of any changes.
This Statement covers Trimble's family of corporate web sites, which include:

Some of our subsidiaries or programs have their own, possibly different, policies.
We encourage you to read this privacy policy and those of all web sites you visit.
==========
The Information We Collect Online and How It's Used
You can browse our Web site without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit.
Only general, non-personally identifiable information that Trimble logs from all site visits, such as Internet service provider, operating system/browser type, and pages accessed, will be collected in those instances.
This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will not be individually identified.
There are times, however, when we or our business partners may need information from you*.
==========
For example, you may choose to give us personal information when you:

Purchase products or services
Register as a user of Trimble products 
Make requests for materials, customer and other services, and product support, repairs and upgrades
Subscribe to newsletters and online services
Enter Trimble-sponsored contests, sweepstakes and other promotions
Create a user profile to receive future information, special offers and communications

At such times we may ask you to provide contact and billing information (e.g., your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiration date), as well as information about the product or service purchased (e.g., product I.D., serial number, customer number, product version).
We also may request demographic or other personal information, however, volunteering such information is optional with you.
By providing the information to Trimble you consent to our transfer of this information to our company databases and other repositories, wherever located.
We may use the information you provide to notify you later about new developments with respect to the products and services you have purchased; to inform you about new products, special offers and services offered by Trimble its family of affiliated companies or its business partners; to provide you with a more personal experience on our site; or to analyze sales trend data as it relates to geography, time, and demographics.
In all such cases, Trimble keeps the information you provide confidential.
