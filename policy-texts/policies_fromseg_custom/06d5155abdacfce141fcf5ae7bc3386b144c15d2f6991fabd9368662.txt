PLAIN ENGLISH PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated March 2nd, 2017
Almost every privacy policy we’ve ever read is incomprehensible.
Yes, you can read our legal team approved policy below this plain english version.
If you want plain english, keep reading.
==========
We collect data about individual mobile devices.
We use that data to keep apps free by helping ourselves and our customers make more money in mobile and to build better products.
We never have individual visibility into what a specific device is doing at any time.
Instead, we group data from all the devices we measure to create groups of similar audiences: the business traveler, the soccer parents, the frequent shopper, etc.
How we collect data...
Companies that work with us integrate our product into their apps either through our SDK (software development kit) or via our API (application program interface).
==========
Those are just fancy words that mean their apps can pass us information, and we can pass information back to their apps.
Data we collect
The device ID, or the unique identifier for your smartphone or tablet.
We create our own anonymous and randomized device ID based off your device’s actual device ID.
This allows us to have an anonymous identifier from which we can begin to build a persona for that device; like Business Traveler or Sports Enthusiast.
==========
Your Location.
If you share location with an app using our SDK, we track the latitude and longitude coordinates of the phone when you open the app.
This is called “Precise Location Data”.
We can also track location if your device came into contact with any beacons, a type of Bluetooth Low Energy sensor.
Over time, we may able to determine a home or work location for the device based upon usage patterns.
If you’ve disabled or opted out of location sharing, we don’t collect or store your location.
==========
Other Data Collected
The advertising ID that Apple and Google require for each unique device.
They require that advertisers use these identifiers, instead of the device ID.
Apple’s is called the IDFA.
Google calls theirs the Advertising ID.
The operating system on your phone.
We, and our customers, want to know if you’re sporting a 2 year old model or the gigantic iPhone 6 Plus.
That says something about you, and if your device can even support our product.
==========
Which version of the app you have running.
If we’ve pushed out an app upgrade, the app version allows us to track how quickly it’s being adopted.
Whether or not you’ve got location services enabled.
If location is turned on for an app, we’ll gather your device’s location.
If not, we won’t look at location.
Whether or not you’ve got Bluetooth enabled.
If this is turned on, your app can detect when it comes within proximity of a Bluetooth sensor, or beacon.
Many retailers are installing these in their stores across the country.
It allows us to verify that you’ve actually visited a location.
==========
The language setting of your phone, which in techno-speak is called “locale”.
Advertisers want to know if you speak English, Spanish, French, etc so that you can get ads in your preferred language.
The IP addresses to which your device connects.
When your phone or tablet connects to WiFi, for example, it connects to a specific IP address.
We collect these IP addresses as it can help determine other devices that connect to the same WiFi, such as your home laptop or desktop computer.
The wifi router to which your device connects.
When your phone connects to a wifi router, we receive back the names of that router, known as the SSID and BSSID.
==========
We store this data indefinitely as long as the device remains active.
If you get rid of your smartphone or tablet, and it’s inactive for 180 days, we purge this device’s data.
We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information on persons under 13 years of age.
Why we collect data
This is our mission: create value in mobile.
The more data we collect, the more we understand about an app’s overall audience.
This data helps companies create more value in mobile, i.e. make more money, in two ways.
==========
First, companies pay higher advertising rates to reach more well-defined audiences.
As a result, the Reveal Mobile powered ads you receive on your smart phone or tablet will be more relevant to you and a better match to the audience the advertiser is trying to reach.
The only thing worse than ads is irrelevant ads.
==========
Second, companies build better products when they know who their audience is, what they prefer, and what they respond to.
Better products result in happier customers, more product usage, and therefore more money.
Why do companies need to make money with their mobile apps?
==========
Any company that shares their content freely on the internet must pay their teams to produce it, build the product, host the product, and deliver that content.
These companies typically fund their mobile products through advertising.
Your access to the app and its content is free, however you “pay” with your data.
This how many internet businesses operate today, and is similar to getting discounts at the grocery store by using your loyalty cards, or getting points for using airline miles programs, and just about anything you get for “free”.
==========
More things we do with data...
We add to it.
We take data from other sources, like US Census data, and add that to the data we collect.
This data doesn’t personally identify you or your device, but instead allows us to put like devices into similar groups such as age ranges, income ranges, gender, and education level.
==========
We share it with the customer that embedded our SDK in their app.
App publishers embed our SDK in their app so that they can see and understand their mobile audience makeup.
They can then create targeted audience segments to sell to advertisers.
We provide our customers with a user interface to see their mobile audience data, and to create those segments.
We may sell it.
==========
We may make our data available to other companies to use as well.
These data companies may then add their own data on top of the data we’ve already provided.
Do we ever sell the ability to look up a specific device and see all of the details about it?
Absolutely not.
Purchasing data occurs at a broader and anonymized audience level.
==========
Here’s how it typically plays out.
An advertiser wants to reach a targeted audience, like male homeowners in their late 30’s, on any app they can.
Just before the ad loads on an app, the technology delivering those ads checks to see if any of our data matches up with the type of audience the advertiser wants to reach.
If it does, we deliver the ad, and charge for using our audience data.
==========
Opt-in
Apps on Apple devices, like iPhones, and Android/Google devices, like Samsung Galaxy, ask for permission to collect data in different ways.
Older Android phones running older Android operating systems require you to accept any permissions that the app asks for before you can install the app.
If you downloaded the app, you’ve opted in.
Newer Android phones allow you to opt-in or out of location sharing after downloading the app.
Apple apps allow you to download the app, but then to opt-out of sharing location, Bluetooth settings, and certain advertising settings on your device’s Settings > General pages.
==========
If you opt-out of any of these after downloading an app using Reveal Mobile, we honor these settings and don’t collect those data points.
Opt-out
We believe in being open and transparent with everyone about the data we collect and why.
Still, you’ve read this and decided it’s not for you.
==========
That’s okay, and we’re here to help.
Our product respects the advertising settings on your phone to limit ad tracking.
If you disable ad tracking on your phone or tablet, we no longer collect or store any data about your device.
You can also email optout@revealmobile.com and we’ll remove your device(s) from our database within 7 business days or less.
You’ll need to provide us with the IDFA (iPhones) or Advertiser ID (Android phones) in order for us to remove your device.
We don’t collect any email addresses, names, or phone numbers, so we need this identifier to find your device in our database.
If you want to see the data we have stored for your device and you’ve shared your IDFA / AdID, email info@revealmobile.com.
We’ll then verify you are who you say you are, and then provide you with that data.
Still have questions?
Email us at info@revealmobile.com and we’ll respond.
