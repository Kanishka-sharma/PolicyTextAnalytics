HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes, such as:

To route your calls or message or otherwise provide you with service;
To provide and bill for products and services you purchase and charge to your account;
To deliver and confirm products and services you obtain from us;
To verify your identity and maintain a record of your transactions and interactions with us;
To provide customer and technical services to you;
To create, modify, improve, enhance, remove or fix our network, products and services, and their performance;
To identify and suggest products or services that might interest you;
To make internal business decisions about current and future product and service offerings;
To provide you customized user experiences, including personalized product and service offerings;
To protect our rights, interests, safety and property and that of our customers, service providers and other third parties; and
To comply with law or as required for legal purposes.
Fraud Prevention
We may use Personal Information, including voice print recordings, account information (such as purchase patterns) and device information for investigations or prevention of fraud or network abuse.
We provide fraud prevention services to banks or other third parties.
As part of this service, we may verify your phone number to help those third parties prevent your personal information from being used for fraudulent purposes.
We also may provide the information you report as spam to 7726 to a third party to prevent fraud or network abuse, and we may share such information with government agencies and others that work to combat spam and prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices.
==========
Information Collected from Cookies
We may also use information collected from cookies or other similar technologies to improve our websites, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request.
Marketing
We may use information we collect to contact you about T-Mobile or third-party products, services, and offers that we believe you may find of interest.
We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or other methods.
You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time as outlined below in Choices Regarding Use of Your Information.
Directories
We do not publish directories of our customers' wireless numbers; nor will we provide or make such numbers available to third-parties for listing in their public directories, without the customer’s prior consent.
==========
Performance, Diagnostics & Management
We collect information about devices, our network and WiFi usage to perform diagnostic analyses and understand how your device is performing overall.
Diagnostic data helps us troubleshoot technical issues related to your device’s performance such as battery life, dropped calls, processing speed, device memory, service coverage, and network and WiFi signal strength that you and other customers may experience.
If you are using a device in WiFi mode, we may collect information about that usage, such as the routing address and IP address.
We also may use diagnostic data to identify and recommend products and services.
Location-Based Services
If your device is turned on, our network is collecting data about the device location.
We may use, provide access to, or disclose this network location data without your approval to provide and support our services, including to route wireless communications, operate and improve our network and business, detect and prevent fraud, provide emergency responders information about how to find you when you call 911, or as required by law or emergency.
Depending on your device, you may be able to obtain services (such as mapping or ride-sharing service) that use the location of your device.
==========
These services, referred to as Location-Based Services (“LBS”), are generally provided by third-parties in connection with apps or websites.
Third-party LBS providers generally use your device operating system’s location capabilities, which can determine location independent of our network, to derive device location.
We do not share network location data with third-party LBS providers for their LBS.
It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device and the privacy policies and terms under which third-party LBS are provided.
In some cases, T-Mobile may provide LBS services.
==========
Where we do so, we will request your permission before we access precise location data to support the service.
If you have previously consented to our app or service accessing precise location data, you may revoke that permission at any time through the device’s operating system location preference controls or the app settings.
You may also follow the standard uninstall process to remove the app from your device.
T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available here.
For additional details, please review our article on Location Services in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.

Telematics
Data from our SyncUp connected car service is used to provide you with that vehicle monitoring service, to enable the functions of the SyncUp associated Motion app, and to enable WiFi connectivity in your car.
In addition, your data may be shared with our application provider in order to enable third-party services that use your personal data, though in such cases no third-party will be granted access to data that identifies you without first obtaining your consent.
We may also use such data for any of the other purposes listed in this statement, such as internal analysis, or to personalize offers we provide to you.
==========
Advertising
You may see T-Mobile and other advertisements on your devices - whether you are connected to our network or using another connection method (e.g., WiFi or wireline connections).
In some cases, these ads may be targeted to your device based on information the advertiser has gathered about your prior online or offline behavior, or other data about your interests.
These online ads are sometimes called “interest-based” or “targeted” ads.
==========
Like most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T-Mobile works with advertising networks, which collect certain information about our site and app visitors, serve ads on our behalf, and measure their effectiveness.
The advertising networks that provide these ads may place cookies, web beacons, or use similar technologies on their partners’ websites and apps, including T-Mobile’s.
This technology allows them to track device activity over time across online properties – but we don’t allow these advertising networks to collect information on our websites or apps that identifies you personally (such as your name, address, or phone number).
Their use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies and those of the sites where they operate.
==========
You can opt-out of targeted ads provided by most advertising networks.
Please be aware, however, that even if you opt-out of interest-based ads, you will continue to see just as many ads, but they may not be as relevant to you.
Ads on Your Mobile Device, Computer or Other Device
You can opt-out of targeted ads served on your mobile device or computer by most advertising networks as follows:
In most cases your opt-out choice will apply only to the specific device on which it was made.
You may need to separately opt-out from your other devices.
If the opt-out mechanism is cookie-based (such as the AdChoices program) and you delete cookies from your browser or reset your device, you may need to perform the opt-out again.
==========
To learn more about ad targeting and how to opt-out of interest-based ads, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
You can also partially manage targeted ads on your mobile device through your device operating system’s settings for advertising IDs.
Resetting your device advertising ID does not opt-out the device from targeted ads, but it may limit advertisers’ ability to associate past activity with your device.
Refer to your specific OS for details.
==========
Please note these opt-outs may not impact “contextual” advertisements (e.g., a sporting goods advertisement you see on a sports-themed website) or ads we place on our own websites and apps based on your activity within those properties.
Ads on Social Media
We may work with social media websites or platforms (such as Facebook or Twitter) to serve targeted ads to you as part of a customized social media campaign.
You can opt-out of receiving customized ads on your social media platforms by changing your ad preferences on those platforms, which we do not control.
We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
For additional details, please review our article on Advertising Choice in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
