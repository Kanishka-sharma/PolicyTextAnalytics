Leiki and Privacy
Short version
Our policy on privacy is simple and clear; identities of users are none of our business.
Longer version 
We don't track or store any data that can be used to identify a particular person; no name, address or phone number, no email address, user name or IP address is recorded by our service.
Instead we keep our users totally anonymous.
==========
Only a random number stored in a cookie tells us that the browser who visited a page was the same browser as the one who visited another page yesterday.
We have no idea who was using that browser.
As we have no idea who is using our system, we don't have any kind of person registry of our users either.
Many online services are very eager to get any kind of personal identifier they can, sometimes sneakily asking for email addresses, real names and even income levels.
==========
So why have we chosen to keep our users anymous?
We think most users prefer it that way.
We respect them.
==========
It makes our business more straightforward and life simpler.
There are plenty of laws concerning person registries.
We want to respect these laws.

We don't just say "we're not evil", we actually are not  
Customer sites
Some of the sites that are our customers use registration and login of users, asking for personal information.
For example webshops usually require registration and login before you can make a purchase.
If you have given them the right to do so (by accepting terms of use), they can combine their person registry with our service.
Our privacy policy remains the same in these cases: Leiki has no idea who you are.
If there's any personal information it's all in the customer's system, not ours.

Manage your profile
Below are buttons to clear the anonymous profile associated with your browser or to disable our anonymous tracking.
"Clearing your profile" means that all the information on interests associated with your browser is removed.
This means that your interest profile will start to accumulate from scratch when you click on sites using our service.
"Disabling anonymous tracking" means that interests associated with your browser will not be tracked anymore.
If our customers use personal recommendations (e.g. on a service frontpage) they will not reflect your the interest profile associated with your browser anymore.
Contextual recommendations which are based on the contents of the page you are viewing will work as before.
Please note that disabling the personal recommendations will cause you to see less interesting content on our customer sites, with more need to use a search engine and a bigger chance of missing personally interesting articles.
So even though we give you the choice, we don't recommend clicking this button.
