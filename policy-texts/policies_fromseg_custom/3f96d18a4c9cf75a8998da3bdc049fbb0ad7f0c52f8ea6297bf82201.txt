About IP Addresses 
 PlasmaNet collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
This information is also used in your welcome email to confirm that in fact you have registered for FreeLotto and will be used in the event that you dispute registration.
In some cases an IP address is specific to your computer.
In other cases an IP address is randomly assigned with a block of IP addresses which are assigned by your ISP (internet service provider) every time you log on.
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your ISP server.
Web servers - the big computers that "serve" up Web pages - automatically identify your ISP by its IP address.
==========
When players request pages from PlasmaNet websites, our servers log and record the players' IP addresses.
Cookies - The PlasmaNet Online Cookies Policy What are cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your registration, passwords, and references while you're at our site.
The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at most major Web sites.
By "looking" for a cookie our server can determine whether or not you have already registered to play.
Cookies help our server to know you are playing, so that you don't need to register each time you play.

Think of it as a membership card.
Similarly, the cookie tracks which of our sponsors you've visited so that we can constantly introduce you to new and interesting sponsors.
