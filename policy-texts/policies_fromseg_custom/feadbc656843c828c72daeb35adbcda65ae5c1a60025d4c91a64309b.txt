Cookies
In addition to information collected automatically, we use cookies, which are small pieces of information sent to your browser by a website that you visit.
The cookies do not collect personally identifiable information.
Cookies are used to track usage patterns, traffic trends and customer behavior, as well as to record other information from the Website.
When you register on the Website, cookies also allow us to save information so that you will not have to re-enter it the next time you visit.
Many content adjustments and customer service improvements are made based on the data derived from cookies.
==========
Some Smithsonian websites use a third-party vendor, Google Analytics, to place cookies and analyze the information collected by cookies in order to make the Smithsonian website more interesting and useful to you.
Information that we collect from cookies will not be used to create profiles of individual users and only will be used in aggregate form.
You may set your browser to refuse cookies from any website that you visit.
If you so choose, you may still gain access to most of the Smithsonian’s Website, but you may not be able to conduct certain types of transactions (such as shopping) or take advantage of some of the interactive elements offered.
You also may opt out of Google Analytics using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

If You Send Us Personal Information
The Smithsonian’s Website will only collect personal information which you knowingly and voluntarily provide by, for example, sending emails, completing membership forms, registering for classes, events, or other programs, responding to surveys or ordering merchandise.
If you provide us with personal information, we will normally respond to your inquiry, request or order.
We may also contact you to provide information about Smithsonian activities, programs, membership and development opportunities, products and special events that may interest you.
We will never share your name or information outside the Smithsonian unless you affirmatively authorize us to do so by opting-in.
==========
When we send you such information by email, you will always have an immediate opportunity to decline further communication.
Please use the contact specified in the email so that we can remove you from the list that contains your name.

==========
The Smithsonian uses outside vendors to provide certain services on our behalf, such as companies who conduct customer satisfaction surveys on our behalf or who process credit card transactions for the Smithsonian.
These third-party vendors will have access to the information needed to perform their functions, but may not use your information for any other purpose.
Some Smithsonian units on occasion, rent or exchange select member name and address information with other well- established charitable, or cultural non-profit organizations.
==========
You will be notified of any such sharing and you will be provided an opportunity to opt-out of any such sharing.
There may be sites within the Smithsonian’s network of Websites where you can opt-in to receive information from non-Smithsonian entities.
If you opt-in, you may receive correspondence from these organizations on programs, products or services that might interest you.
If you decide to opt-out of receiving any further correspondence from a non-Smithsonian entity, please correspond directly with that business or organization to be removed from their mailing list.
