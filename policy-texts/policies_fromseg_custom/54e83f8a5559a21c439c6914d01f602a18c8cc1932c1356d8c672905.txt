NORDSTROM.com Security Statement
Protecting customer information is a priority for NORDSTROM.com.
To guard your information, our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address, so only NORDSTROM.com is able to decode your information.
==========
To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window.
If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the SSL is active and your information is secure.
Most browsers offer additional security alerts, as well.
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls (local network security) don't permit communication even though the server is secure.
If, for some reason, you are unable to connect to our secure server, or you prefer to purchase via telephone, please call us toll free at 1-888-282-6060.
With regard to overall security, we always use industry standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving data exchanged with our website.
The facilities that house our servers are physically secured to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of all data and information collected.
==========
In addition, our SSL transactions have been tested by a third party auditor.

THE ABOVE POLICY APPLIES TO INFORMATION TRANSMITTED TO US USING THIS WEBSITE.
