We take reasonable technical and organizational security measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
In addition, we will not keep your Personal Information for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this policy.
==========
Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through our Services.
Your Personal Information is stored on servers maintained with the assistance of a third party data storage provider.
To help protect the privacy of data and personal information we collect and hold, our data storage provider maintains physical, technical, and administrative safeguards which are monitored, tested, and updated on an ongoing basis.
When we engage third-party service providers and when disclosure of Personal Information to such providers is necessary for the provision of such Services, we ensure that such providers protect Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and, where applicable, are responsible for ensuring that such third parties process European Union (EU) Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Shield Principles discussed below and/or the General Data Protection Regulation or other applicable legislation.

==========
Your use of the Services or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in these jurisdictions, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We comply with the Privacy Shield Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission, regarding the collection, use and retention of Personal Information received from the European Union.
As we are a U.S. company, we have voluntarily decided to comply with the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
We annually certify our adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice; choice; accountability for onward transfer; security; data integrity and purpose limitation; access; and recourse, enforcement and liability.

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree.
Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.
==========
Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.
Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies some parts of our Services may not work and that when you revisit our Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
==========
Cookies and tracking devices used by AspenCore, as categorized by function:

Strictly necessary cookies – These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website.
They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into areas of our website.
Analytical/performance cookies – Allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move on our website.
==========
This helps improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
Functionality cookies – These are used to recognize you when you return to our website.
This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences.
==========
Targeting cookies – These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.
We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests.
We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
==========
Cookies can also be categorized by how long they remain on your device.
There are two broad categories of duration:

Persistent cookies – Persistent cookies remain on your device until deleted manually or automatically.
Session cookies – Session cookies remain on your device until you close your browser when they are automatically deleted.

Our persistent cookies last no longer than one (1) year.
==========
Information collected by our cookies:
Cookies on our website collect several types of information, including information about your usage of our website and we may collect your IP address as a logged file.
An IP address is the number assigned to your device, for example your laptop or mobile phone, when your device accesses the internet.
==========
To the extent that IP addresses are personal data under applicable data protection law, we treat it as Personal Information.
If we link information collected through cookies with any personal data you provide to us through the website, e.g., through submitting a form, we also treat that information as Personal Information.
For information on how we handle personal data collected through the site, please see above.
==========
How to manage cookies in your browser:
Most modern browsers will allow you to:

See what cookies you’ve got and delete them on an individual basis;
Block third party cookies;
Block cookies from sites;
Block all cookies from being set; and
Delete all cookies when you close your browser.
You should be aware that any preferences will be lost if you delete cookies.
This includes where you have opted out from cookies, as this requires an opt-out cookie to be set.
Also, if you block cookies completely many websites will not work properly and some functionality on these websites will not work at all.
We do not recommend turning cookies off when using our website and Services for these reasons.
If you are primarily concerned about third-party cookies generated by advertisers, you can turn these off separately.
==========
With respect to our mobile applications, you can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the app.
Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling location identifying services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.
==========
Third-party cookies and tracking devices:
When you are using our Services, you may notice that there is content from other websites which we add from time to time to improve the user experience.
As a result, you may be sent cookies from these other websites.
We do not control these cookies and we suggest you check these third-party websites for more information about the cookies they use and how you can manage them.
Managing advertising cookies:
Please note that if you want to opt out from targeted advertising cookies, this does not mean that you will receive less advertising when you use our services.
This just means that the advertising you see will not be as relevant or customized to you.
However, if you still want to opt out of these third party advertising cookies, you can do this by visiting the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s website www.youronlinechoices.com which lists all ad serving cookies that are currently set on your device and tells you how to opt-out from each of them.
Please note that this website lists many more networks than those used by us.
==========
Please remember that if you choose to opt out of targeted advertising from a specific company or via www.youronlinechoices.com, it only applies to the web browser on the device you are using.
You will therefore need to follow the same process on every device you use or different web browser that you use to exercise the same choice.
==========
Further information about cookies:
If you wish to learn more about cookies in general and how to manage them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Cookie Policy Updates:

You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at http://www.youradchoices.com and its opt-out program for mobile applications at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
==========
In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”).
NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt-out of certain targeted advertising delivered by NAI members’ ad networks.
To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt-out of certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads.
We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
However, we support the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and expect that ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based ads will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance.

Communications
You can opt-out of receiving promotional communications (e-mails or text messages) from us at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, following the instructions as provided in e-mails to click on the unsubscribe link or changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account; and (ii) for text messages, following the instructions as provided in text messages from us to text the word, “STOP”.
Please note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions.
If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscriptions may continue.
Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, we may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or our ongoing business relations.
==========
Our mobile applications may send you notifications that may include alerts, sounds, and icon badges.
These push notifications or in-app messages may include both operational messages and promotional messages regarding products, services and offers that may be of interest to you.

==========
How We Will Verify Your Request:
The processes that we follow to verify your identity when you make a request to know or a request to delete are described below.
The relevant process depends on how and why the request is submitted and requests through a password protected account may not be available in all circumstances.
i. Requests Through Your Password-Protected Account:
If you created a password-protected account with us before the date of your request, we will rely on the fact that your request has been submitted through your account as verification of your identity.
We will require that you re-authenticate yourself before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a request to know and before we delete your Personal Information in response to a request to delete.
==========
You are responsible for protecting the security of your log-in credentials for your account.
Please do not share your log-in credentials with anyone.
If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from your account, we will not respond to a request to know or a request to delete until we have been able to confirm, through further verification procedures, that you made the request.
ii.
==========
Requests Other Than Through A Password-Protected Account:
If you submit a request by any means other than through a password-protected account that you created before the date of your request, the verification process that we follow will depend on the nature of your request as described below:









Requests To Know Categories of Personal Information: If you request to know categories of Personal Information collected, sources, sales, or AspenCore’s business or commercial purposes for use of your Personal Information, we will match at least two or more data points that you provide with your request to know, or in response to our request for verification information, against information about you we already have in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity.
Examples of relevant data points may include your name and email address, your zip code or information about products or services that you have purchased from us.
Requests for Copies or Requests to Delete Personal Information: Our process for verifying your identity will depend on the sensitivity (as determined by us) of the Personal Information that you ask us to delete or to provide copies of specific pieces of Personal Information.
==========
For less sensitive Personal Information, we will require a match of two data points as described in Point No. 1, above.
For more sensitive Personal Information, we will require a match of three data points and a signed declaration.
==========
We have implemented the following additional procedures when verifying the identity of requestors:









If we cannot verify your identity based on the processes described above, we may ask you for additional verification information.If we do so, we will permanently delete the verification information that you provide promptly after we have completed the verification process.
We will not use that information for any purpose other than verification.
If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity.
==========
D. Authorized Agents
You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your right to know or your right to delete by submitting to us a completed “Authorized Agent Designation” form.
You can obtain the designation form by contacting us at privacy@aspencore.com*protected email*.
If an authorized agent submits a request to know or a request to delete on your behalf, the authorized agent must submit with the request either (a) a power of attorney that is valid under California law, or (b) a document signed by you that authorizes the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf.
In addition, we may ask you to follow the applicable process described above for verifying your identity.
==========
E. AspenCore’s Non-Discrimination Policy
California consumers have the right not to be subject to discriminatory treatment by AspenCore for exercising their privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and we will not discriminate on that basis.
However, we may charge a California consumer a different price or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services if the difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the California consumer by the consumer’s Personal Information.
If we do so, we will provide consumers with any legally required notice.
F. Use of The Websites by Minors
Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Services, and who have posted content or information on the Services, can request removal by contacting us at privacy@aspencore.com*protected email*or by sending a letter to AspenCore, 245 Main Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02142, with information detailing where the content or information is posted.

This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal.
==========

G. Right to Information About Disclosures of Personal Information for Direct Marketing Purposes
California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes.
For our U.S. users, we may from time to time elect to share certain information about you collected by us on the Service with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes.
