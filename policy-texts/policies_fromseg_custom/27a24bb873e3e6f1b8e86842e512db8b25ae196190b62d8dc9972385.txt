In this Privacy Policy, we discuss our data use practices in relation to individuals and devices.
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) refers to data that is used, or intended to be used, to directly identify a particular individual; Non-PII refers to data that is not linked, or reasonably linkable, to an individual, but is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device; and De-Identified Data refers to data that is not linkable to either an individual or a device.
Short Form Privacy Policy
While we encourage you to read the entire privacy policy, the following summary provides some key information relating to our privacy disclosures and practices.
==========
Information Collection: PII
We do not collect PII, as defined by the Network Advertising Alliance and Digital Advertising Alliance.
For example, PII may be collected should a consumer contact EMX on his/her own initiative or opt-in to register with a publisher to download a mobile app.
Information Collection: Non-PII
The Non-PII we collect may include, as an example, browser types, IP address, domain names, operating systems, language preference, platform type, access dates and times, referring website addresses, browsing, search activity, and online transactions.
Information Collection: Appended Information
We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you.
==========
This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.
Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include: Purchased marketing data about our customers from third parties that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products.
How Information is Put to Use
We may use your Non-PII for purposes such as enhancement of our services, marketing, and to more effectively match advertisements to devices, browsers, and applications.
Sharing Your Information
We may share your information with third party service providers with whom we have contracted, EMX and its subsidiaries and affiliates, third party marketing partners, business partners and our clients and publishers, and as expressly provided for herein.
Your Choices
You may regulate the collection and use of Non-PII in your browser, by uninstalling or electing not to install an app, or opting out with the Network Advertising Initiative or Digital Advertising Alliance at either https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or https://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
==========
Security
We use reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your data.
Retention
We retain Non-PII for no more than is reasonably necessary for advertising purposes.
Aggregate Non-PII data for reporting may be retained for a longer period.

What Does EMX Do?
EMX was founded with the basic premise that people are empowered when they receive content that is free and access to information is available to as many people as possible.
==========
We work very hard to develop timely, relevant, and appropriate digital advertising technology which serves the public, advertisers and publishers.
We provide users with a more relevant and better online experience through the responsible use of data for advertising.
This belief that a better user experience creates a better Internet for everyone is incorporated into our Privacy by Design approach, and we believe that each person's private information should be protected while we strive to provide benefits of a free Internet through digital advertising.
Our success, in part, comes from our ability to achieve two basic needs in a holistic fashion:

Preserve every person's right to receive free information from publishers by maximizing the value that advertisers and publishers get from better relevancy, analytics, and resulting yield maximization; and
Respect every person's privacy by not utilizing personally identifiable information to determine what advertising is appropriate to them.
This experience has helped us forge our business around one central belief:It is possible to provide each individual with the privacy they deserve, while giving them access to positive-sum innovation that is valuable to society in the form of a free Internet experience that is both relevant to consumers and economically viable for advertisers and publishers.
==========
Scope of Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to EMX and not to any of our third party partners.
We discuss the online method of collection and use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) gathered by us.
It also does not apply to the privacy practices of any of our advertisers or publishers.
==========
Privacy by Design.
Our foundation of building a strong privacy framework at EMX follows an internal framework of Privacy by Design.
We integrate privacy in strategy, product development, and more.
Our internal procedures include privacy protection early and often, proactively keeping PII out of our systems, and building infrastructure that is effective without the use of PII.
==========
We can protect consumer privacy AND provide relevant advertising, which benefits everyone involved, especially advertisers, consumers, and small business websites.
Ensuring the protection of privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of the data is of the utmost importance and EMX is careful to protect privacy as data is collected, used, and destroyed responsibly.
EMX has developed a strong privacy foundation and has a company culture aimed at the prevention of the receipt and use of PII for use with interest-based advertising (“IBA”).
How Does EMX Provide Consumers Relevant Advertising?
We partner with businesses ("Advertisers") whose privacy policies allow them to share Non-PII information about their customers and/or inquirers as well as information about a consumer’s interests as inferred from their web browser.
This information may include the date and time of a visit to an Advertiser’s website or mobile application, the pages or product information viewed during that visit, and links or ads that were clicked.
==========
The information allows us to analyze and understand more about the things you are or might be interested in, allowing EMX to show more interesting and relevant ads to you.
EMX may engage in cross-device data collection and targeting.
EMX does not collect or maintain PII for marketing purposes as defined under the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).
==========
This means that we do not accept or use your name, address, email address, or any sensitive information such as your credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or medical records to provide our personalized advertising service.
EMX supports the NAI Codes of Conduct’s obligations around the collection and use of health information for interest-based advertising.
This health-related information, when collected and/or used for relevant advertising, is non-sensitive and consumers may exercise choice through an opt-out basis.
==========
The NAI also permits EMX to collect and use sensitive health information when the user provides explicit opt-in consent in the United States.

How does EMX Find Consumers on the Web?
==========
When a consumer visits our website, one of our Advertiser's websites, or engages with an advertisement we serve, a "cookie" or "pixel tag" may be placed on the consumer’s machine or we may collect device identifiers like iOS and Android Unique Identification Number (UID).
Information collected from a cookie, UID, or pixel tag are not linked to PII.
No PII is transferred in the EMX cookie, UID or pixel tag.
EMX only knows that consumer by a pseudonymous ID, so that we can provide more relevant advertisements to the consumer.
Again, we don't know who the consumer is, we just know the consumer's preferences through that identifier.
What is a "Cookie" or "Pixel Tag"?
A cookie is an industry-standard small data file placed on a consumer's computer.
==========
Cookies allow marketers to "remember you" when you return to their website.
Again, no PII is transferred in the EMX cookie.
Consumers have the capability of deleting cookies on their machine; however, if they enjoy the convenience of a website remembering them, consumers are advised not to delete their cookies.
This website may contain, in addition to EMX cookies, other third party cookies that assist us in supplying information that will make it easier for you to navigate on our site.
==========
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear gif) is an industry-standard, often transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed in a website or e-mail.
Pixel tags are used by EMX to transfer relevant Non-PII data from this website or an Advertiser's website to EMX’s servers for the purpose of providing personalized video and display advertisements.
Cookies are used by EMX to link this Non-PII data to non-identified unique users.
Pixel tags and cookies may also be used to link additional Non-PII information provided by a third party.
==========
We may collect information about your visits to our and other websites, including the pages you view, the links and advertisements you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with website visits and advertisements we serve.
We may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our or one of our advertiser’s or publisher’s websites, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our/other websites and to which URL you browse away from our site if you click on a link on a site.
This information also assists us in measuring things like possible fraud, analytics or measuring the viewability of advertisements for ad serving and billing purposes.
We also collect this data to display different and changing content depending on user input, environmental conditions (such as the time of day), or other variables.
This helps us ensure that the ads we deliver are displaying correctly as we seek to maintain the right user experience and value exchange between consumers, advertisers, and publishers.
==========
Disclosure of Information.
We may disclose proprietary, Non-PII information to our Advertisers for reporting purposes, and we may share aggregated information with other third parties for advertising, marketing and analytical purposes.
EMX may also need to disclose anonymous information if (1) we believe that there has been a violation of the law, of your rights, or of our rights, (2) to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, and (3) if our company or substantially all of its assets are acquired.
==========
Data Retention.
EMX retains data it uses for marketing purposes for eighteen (18) months, after which the information is removed from the user marketing profiles and discarded.
If you have contacted us or provided PII to EMX to be contacted or joined our mailing list, we will retain your information for as long as you're active or as needed to provide you with information.
If you wish to have your information deleted or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please email us at privacy@enginegroup.com.
Your Choices.
We hope that after reading through this Privacy Policy you agree that EMX is collecting and using data responsibly, and that the cumulative benefits of our work are beneficial to the free Internet as a whole and your browsing experience.
==========
However, you may determine that you want to opt-out of Interest Based Advertising (“IBA”).
To learn more about IBA or to opt out click here.
You may also wish to use browser settings to modify your preferences.
At EMX our goal is to offer a harmonized online experience regardless of the browser you use.
Most browsers accept our cookies by default but in certain cases, like Safari, our cookies are blocked by default by the browser settings (and potentially without your knowledge).
In cases where you interact with our service and want to experience our personalized ads your browser settings may  be configured to block certain third party cookies.
==========
EMX and its parent company, Engine Media, LLC, are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and adhere to its Codes of Conduct.
You can learn more about the NAI by visiting www.networkadvertising.org.
NAI offers an online opt-out platform to allow customers to express their choices and provides general information related to Interest Based Advertising
EMX may place ads on websites that are part of the Google Display Network.
Based on your visits to these websites, Google uses an advertising cookie (from DoubleClick) to associate your browser with interest and demographic categories.
Google then uses these categories for IBA on these websites.
To learn more about this and your choices from Google, please click here.
We partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites.
Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interest.
If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general, click here, or if located in the European Union click here.
Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
==========
Some web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting.
This setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing.
This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies.
EMX and most advertising exchanges and networks do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals at this time.
If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Statement.
For more information about “do not track,” visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
You may control the collection and use of Non-PII in your browser by uninstalling or electing not to install an app, or through the Digital Advertising Alliance and Network Advertising Initiative choice pages.
Upon request, EMX will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.
You may access, correct, or request deletion of your PII by contacting us at privacy@enginegroup.com.
We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
==========
Mobile Device Choices.
For mobile websites, you can delete our cookie via the browser settings.
For mobile apps, you can typically limit ad tracking within the settings function.
On most Android devices, in the “Ads” menu, you can opt out of receiving IBA, or reset your advertising ID.
On most Apple iOS devices, you can use the Ad Tracking settings to limit receipt of IBA or reset your device’s Advertising Identifier.
Please note that your experience may be different depending on your individual device and service.
==========
In addition to using the options above, you may also uninstall the application from your device.
If you download a mobile application, it may use advertising to fund its development and maintenance of its software in iOS and Android.
In situations involving applications, if you do not want to receive IBA you will need to remove those applications from your device.
==========
Safeguarding Information We Collect and Us
The security of your information is important to us.
We have implemented appropriate security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it.
We take reasonable physical and technical security measures to protect our data from unauthorized access, as well as unauthorized disclosure.
Privacy of Children.
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.
