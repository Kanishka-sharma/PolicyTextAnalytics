we will and will not do with that information.

How we collect and use personal information
When you sign up for a Spotify account or purchase Spotify’s products and services available on the Spotify web page, we may ask you for certain personal information such as
email address, postal address, age, gender and residence.
When creating a Spotify account, or connecting your already existing Spotify account with your Facebook account, we will
also receive and store the following information from Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”) your name, user name, password, profile picture, unique Facebook
identifier and access token, gender, birthday and email address.
In addition, when you use the Spotify Software Application, Spotify Service and Spotify Websites, we will
automatically receive information about your use of the application, service and website including personal information such as media that you access, queries you make, date and
time of your request, your Internet protocol address, performance of your network and computer, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and
application version.
We will use your personal information (i) to provide the products and services that you have purchased or requested (including Spotify Social, as defined in the
Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use, and the display of customized content and advertising), (ii) to communicate with you concerning
your account, customer service issues and Spotify products and services, (iii) to personalize and improve the Spotify Software Application, the Spotify Service and the Spotify Websites, (iv) to ensure the technical functioning of our products and services, (v) to develop new products and services, and (vi) to protect the copyright-protected content of the Spotify Service (e.g. by limiting access to the Spotify Service content to users with a Spotify account).
==========
If you have activated Spotify Social, we will share your Facebook user name and your Facebook profile picture to other Spotify users connected to Spotify Social.
Further, the default setting is that all your playlists (including created playlists, starred music and top lists) are visible for other Spotify users connected to Spotify Social and may be transferred to a third party as a result of another user’s use of the Spotify Service or a Third
Party Application.
If you do not wish for such use of your personal data to take place, you should not activate Spotify Social or adjust your Spotify Social settings to disallow such sharing.

Sharing information with others
Unless you give us your explicit approval in advance and except as outlined in Section 1 above and except with respect to, Spotify affiliates (being other companies controlled by or under common control with us), we will only share your personal information for the purposes set forth under Section 1 (i) to (vi) above or as is necessary to:

policy, and Spotify’s use is governed by this Spotify Privacy Policy.

previously received.

party to make sure that you understand how they may use the personal
information you provide to them.
