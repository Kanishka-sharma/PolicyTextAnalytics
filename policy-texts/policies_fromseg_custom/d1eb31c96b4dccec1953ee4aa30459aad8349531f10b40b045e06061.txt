What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small file that is exchanged between a web browser and a web server.
Cookies are stored on the (end) device of the user’s website.
In these small files, for example, elementary information such as user settings is stored.
==========
The cookies are then sent back to the original website on each subsequent visit.
Cookies are useful because they enable the website to recognize the user's browser or device within a certain period of time.
Most cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.
This is a string of characters that web pages and servers assign to the browser in which the cookie is stored.
This allows web pages and servers to distinguish the browser from browsers with other cookies, and each browser can be identified by its unique cookie ID.
This is used only to uniquely identify a web browser on a particular device and not to identify a person.
There are three categories of cookies:

cookies that are essential to ensure the basic functionality of the website,
functional cookies to ensure the performance of the website and
Targeted cookies to improve the user’s experience.

==========
