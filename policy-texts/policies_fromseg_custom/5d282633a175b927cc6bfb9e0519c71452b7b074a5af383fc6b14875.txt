Data that is automatically collected.
When  you  use  the  Services,  we  collect  certain  User  Data  about  you  automatically,  including  as  described below.
Log data
    We collect log files and other usage information when you access, use and interact with the Services (even if you have not created an account or logged into your account on the Services), including IP address, date and time that you signed up for an account, language setting, browser type, operating system type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, page you requested, user agent, date and time stamps, clickstream data, and information about your search and click activity.
Cookies
    Some User Data is collected on the Services by us and third parties with whom we partner through the use of Cookies.
Cookies are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your device or browser that allow us,  and  third  parties  with  whom  we  partner,  to  recognize  your  browser  or  mobile  device  and  transfer information  about  you  and  your  use  of  our  Services.
For  example,  Cookies  that  we  use  tell  us  how  many times  you  have  visited  one  of  our  websites,  your  search  preferences,  and  if  you  have  clicked  on  an advertisement that has been displayed to you.
We (and third parties with whom we partner) may also deliver a file known as a web beacon, pixel or pixel tag to you through our Services.
“Web Beacons” are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Services interface or in emails relating to the Services to collect certain information and monitor user activity on  the  Services  interface,  such  as  to  count  visits,  access  Cookies,  understand  usage  effectiveness  and  to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon.
==========
“Pixels” or “Pixel Tags,” also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight, tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user’s device to a third-party  website  (for  example,  information  about  a  user's  browsing  behavior,  what  links  they  click  on,  and purchases they have made on the Services).
We (and third parties with whom we partner) may deliver Web Beacons or Pixel Tags to you through our Services.
Web  Beacons  allow  ad  networks,  marketing  partners  and  other  service  providers  that  we  use  to provide  anonymized,  aggregated  auditing,  research  and  reporting  for  us,  for  advertisers  and  our  other partners.
Web  Beacons  also  enable  ad  networks  and  other  partners  to  track  your  behavior  for  their  own analysis and use, and to serve targeted advertisements to you on the Services or when you visit other websites or platforms.
These Web Beacons enable third-party companies to view, edit, or set their own cookies when you visit the Services, just as if you had visited a web page from their site.
==========
When we talk about “Cookies” in this Privacy Policy, we mean not just cookies, but web beacons and similar technologies.
Please see our Cookie Policy for more information.
SDKs
    We may also use a piece of software on our website known as a software development kit (or “SDK”) in order to collect the types of data described in this Privacy Policy to be stored and used by us and our vendors as described in this Privacy Policy.

Geo-location data
    “Geo-Location  Data”  may  be  collected  with  your  consent  or  inferred  as  you  use  the  Services.

Polls, surveys and quizzes
    When you take a quiz or survey or respond to a poll on the Services, in addition to recording your responses, we record your IP address and/or other identifiers in order to provide an outcome (for quizzes), report and analyze your survey results, or record your vote as part of the final count (for polls).

For example, third parties who provide advertising and related services (such as analytics providers and ad networks) may provide us with User Data so that we can compare it to User Data we hold in order to determine if you are the same individual (one method of doing this is called “cookie-matching”).
==========

We may also sell or transfer User Data to certain Advertisers who will use this data for their own purposes, including to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests.
Some of these third parties may combine the User Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.
We may also share User Data with  Advertisers  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  them  or  their  vendors  or  clients  to  send  you  marketing communications related to your use of the Services, their services or programs featured and/or advertised on the Services (e.g., through ads or Promotions), or their products, services and/or programs generally.

For  example,  if  you  read  content  about  a  particular  subject  on  the  Services,  we  or  our Advertisers may use Cookies to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to  the  viewed  content.
These  third-party  vendors  may  connect  information  about  pages  you  visit  on  the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined  information.

Other useful information regarding your privacy.
Security
We use commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information collected and maintained through our Services.
However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons or hardware or software failure.
==========
The main risk of our processing of your User Data is if it is lost, stolen or misused.
This could lead to your User Data being in the hands of someone else who may use it fraudulently or make public information that you  would  prefer  to  keep  private.
For  this  reason,  we  take  reasonable  precautions  to  safeguard  the confidentiality of your user information, including through use of appropriate organizational and technical measures.
In  the  course  of  provision  of  your  User  Data  to  us,  your  User  Data  may  be  transferred  over  the  internet.
Although we make reasonable efforts to protect the User Data which you provide to us, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure.
As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your User Data transmitted to our website and that any such transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your User Data, we will use strict procedures and security features designed to prevent unauthorized access to it.
==========
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you that you create a strong, unique password that you do not use on other sites and that you do not share your password with anyone.
You are ultimately responsible for the security of your email address and password.
==========
Children
We especially care about the privacy of young children.
Most of our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16 and except as set forth below, we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16 on such Services.
If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a user under 16 years of age on such Services, we will promptly delete any Personal Data that the individual has provided to us.
A few of our Services are clearly identified as being marketed directly to children under the age of 16 (such as  our  Dodo  Kids  channel  on  YouTube).
In  connection  with  such  child-directed  Services,  we  do  not knowingly collect any Personal Data from users under the age of 16 without complying with applicable legal requirements and making appropriate disclosures.
==========
International transfer
Your  User  Data  may  be  used,  stored,  accessed,  transferred  to  and  maintained  on  devices,  servers  located outside  the  territory  in  which  you  reside,  including  to  servers  and  staff  located  in  the  United  States.
Data stored in the United States may be subject to lawful requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the  United  States.
If  we  provide  any  User  Data  about  you  to  any  other  third  parties,  we  will  require  the recipient protects your User Data in accordance with applicable law.
To the extent that Group Nine is deemed to transfer any Personal Data of UK or EEA users outside of the UK or EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on certain transfer mechanisms to transfer such  Personal  Data  as  described  below.
We  will  provide  further  information  on  the  means  to  ensure  an adequate level of data protection for your Personal Data upon your request, which can be directed to us using the contact details in the section below entitled How to contact us.
==========
Standard contractual clauses
        The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as model clauses), which provide  safeguards  for  user  information  that  is  transferred  outside  of  the  EEA  or  UK.
We  often  use  these standard contractual clauses when transferring User Data outside of the UK or EEA, as applicable.
Adequacy decisions
        In some cases, we may transfer your User Data to certain third-party service providers and partners of Group Nine based on an adequacy decision of the UK or European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the country of the receiving party.
Data retention
The time period for which we keep User Data varies according to the information’s use.
In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period.
Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we plan to retain it for no longer than is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need.
If you have questions or concerns about the information in this Privacy Policy, our handling of your Personal Data  more  generally,  your  choices  and  rights  regarding  such  use,  or  wish  to  exercise  your  rights  under applicable law, please do not hesitate to contact us at the contact information below:
