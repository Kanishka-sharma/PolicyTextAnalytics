Specific Consents Granted upon Submission of Your Registration Form:
At the time that you submit your registration form to us to register for the Services and to obtain a free credit score and related analysis of information in connection therewith, you agree that you are providing to us the following specific consents (in addition to being subject to this Agreement):

I understand that by submitting this registration form I am requesting a copy of my consumer credit report and score; such submission shall therefore constitute "written instructions" in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act for Credit Karma to obtain a copy of my consumer credit report and score from TransUnion, at any time Credit Karma requests until this Agreement is terminated and/or I terminate my account with Credit Karma’s Services.
I further authorize TransUnion to provide a copy of my consumer credit report and score to Credit Karma, Inc. at P.O. Box 520, San Francisco, CA 94104-0520, at any time Credit Karma requests until this Agreement is terminated and/or I terminate my account with Credit Karma’s Services.

I understand that Credit Karma will not be sharing my Registration Profile with any of those marketing partners and that it is completely up to me to decide whether I would like to accept any of the offers I receive.
3.
==========
Partner Offers
We will not share your credit report and score with our Partners.
However, we will match offers from Partners against your Registration Profile (as hereinafter defined), which would include your credit report and score along with other targeting criteria, in order to ensure that you receive offers that are tailored to you.
One of the underlying philosophies behind our business, as reflected in the "Credit Karma" name, is that individuals who have through their efforts been able to maintain relatively good credit scores or who have worked hard to re-build their credit should be able to reap the rewards of those efforts, including by receiving discounted and favorable pricing and rates on the products and services that they enjoy.
==========
While we do not guarantee that the offers that you receive from our Partners will meet that goal, or that they will necessarily be the best offers available to you, we do represent and warrant to you that providing you with valuable offers for products and services from our Partners is one of the main animating objectives of our business.
Our technology for matching your Registration Profile to the valuable offers for products and services provided by our Partners is proprietary and, in carrying out such matching, we may elect to consider, ignore, emphasize, or de-emphasize any relevant factors in our sole discretion.
We do not guarantee that you will receive offers for any particular types of products or services.
4.
==========
Savings Estimates
We may use information about your credit card usage and data we have on current credit card offers to calculate how you might save money by transferring one of your credit card balances to another credit card.
We may provide you figures and calculations of possible balance transfer costs, interest savings, value of rewards and bonus points, annual and application fees, estimated total savings and other information if you transfer a credit card balance; however, we provide such calculations for illustration purposes only.
Such estimated figures are provided based upon our calculations and data only, and are neither endorsed nor commissioned by any of our Partners or third-party advertisers.
We do not warrant or guarantee the accuracy, adequacy, timeliness, reliability, completeness or usefulness of any such estimated calculations, and we disclaim liability for errors or omissions in any such estimated calculations.
5.
