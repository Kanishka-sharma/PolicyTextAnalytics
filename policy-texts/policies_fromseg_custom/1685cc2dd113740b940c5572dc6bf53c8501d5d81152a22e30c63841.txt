Fonts.
When you create or input Customer Data into the Services, the Services may enable you, either by active or automated processes (e.g. via autosave functionality), to upload third party-owned fonts included in such Customer Data from your local machine to InVision, and by doing so you understand that you will direct and cause InVision to store such fonts on its servers.
The Services may also allow you to call or link to third party-owned web fonts which are hosted on such third parties’ services.
In either case, the Services may allow you to share these fonts with other Users with whom you are collaborating on a project.
While InVision may present notifications within the Services informing you about the use of fonts, it is ultimately your sole responsibility to ensure that you or your organization possess sufficient rights to use, store on the Services, and redistribute the fonts for use by your collaborators, for all uses of our Services, and all users with whom you share Customer Data.
In some cases, such uses may require you to obtain extended rights from the font licensor.
When deciding whether to use a font on the Services it is always recommended that you consult the font licensor’s license agreement and informational materials.
For example.
here are some publicly available informational resources from a few of the most common font licensors:
https://www.monotype.com/fonts/licensing-101/;
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/font-faq;
https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/font-licensing.html;
https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq.

Sharing.
The Services allow you to share Customer Data in a number of ways including, for example, by the use of a “share link”, via third party services and platforms you link to the Service, on social media services that you interact with through the Services, and within your team and organization.
Some share functionality is limited to view only, but some will allow the recipient of your shared Customer Data to modify and create derivative works of such Customer Data, so you should always be aware of the access permissions you are granting before deciding to do so.
==========
You understand and agree that you participate in the sharing of your Customer Data and third party data through the Services at your own risk, and that if you choose to participate in such sharing you are solely responsible for ensuring that you have sufficient rights to do so.
Any disputes regarding ownership or licensing of Customer Data that has been shared by you or any User are between you and those parties that have access to such Customer Data due to your or your Users sharing activities.
We are not responsible for resolving any intellectual property or ownership disputes between Users or between you and anyone else that has access to your Customer Data due to your sharing, so you should exercise good judgment when deciding whether or not to participate in sharing Customer Data, or to allow others to participate in your sharing of Customer Data.

InVision is not responsible or liable for anything provided by a Non-InVision party at your direction, including but not limited to: (a) the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of any third party services; or (b) any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with, the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any third party services.
If you chose to enable a third party service that complements the Services, please be sure you understand whether you will be sharing any data with the provider of such service, and what you will be permitting the provider to do to such data.
InVision is not responsible for any use, modification, disclosure or deletion of data (including Customer Data) that is transmitted to, or accessed by, a third party service, due to your actions.
Any third party services that complement or otherwise integrate with the Services are not our services, so we do not warrant, certify, endorse or support developer products, and you (and not us) will decide whether or not to enable them, and any use of such services is solely the responsibility of you and the applicable third party provider.
