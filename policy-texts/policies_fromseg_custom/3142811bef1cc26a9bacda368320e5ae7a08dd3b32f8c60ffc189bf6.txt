==========
This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights based on your jurisdiction of residence.
Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
Governing Law
This Agreement, and all claims related to it, or the performance by both parties under it, shall be governed exclusively by the internal substantive laws of the State of Minnesota, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16).
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded and shall not apply to this Agreement.
==========
You hereby agree and irrevocably attorn and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Minneapolis, Minnesota with respect to all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and expressly and irrevocably waive any defense of personal and/or subject matter jurisdiction in those courts and any claims on the grounds of forum non conveniens.
For any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm, you agree that Minneapolis, Minnesota is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
Arbitration
Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Leadpages.
==========
For any dispute with Leadpages, you agree to first contact us at legal@leadpages.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Leadpages has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.
JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.
==========
The arbitration will be conducted in Minneapolis, Minnesota, unless you and Leadpages agree otherwise.
If you are using Leadpages for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
If you are an individual using Leadpages for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Leadpages from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.
Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used Leadpages for personal, commercial or other purposes, all Claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding.
This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s Claims.
==========
You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Leadpages are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.
Limitation on Claims
You and Leadpages agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Services and/or your use thereof must commence within one (1) year after the date that such cause of action arises.
Otherwise, such cause of action shall be deemed waived by you and Leadpages.
==========
