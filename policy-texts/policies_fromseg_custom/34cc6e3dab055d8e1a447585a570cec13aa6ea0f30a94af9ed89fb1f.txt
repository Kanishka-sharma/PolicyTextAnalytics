PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY
This Privacy Policy describes iProspect's processing of personal data in the course of using iNetPro, an affiliate marketing platform.
It also explains the choices you have regarding your personal data ("Your Rights") and how to contact us.
==========
In the context of so-called affiliate marketing, "publishers" place advertisements (promotional materials or Ads) provided by advertisers ("Advertisers") in their publications.
These vary and depend on the activity of the respective publisher.
A typical distribution channel is, for example, the publication of the advertising media in a publisher's own websites or blogs.
In the event of a successful referral of a customer to an advertiser by the publisher, the latter receives a commission for its successful referral efforts.
The iNetPro platform calculates the extent to which the intermediary (publisher) is entitled to remuneration.

==========
About the processing of personal data by iProspect.
In the following, we would like to give you an overview of what types of personal data we process, for what purposes, and to what extent.
1.
==========
disclosure of data by the advertiser (advertiser)
The respective advertiser from whom you make a purchase (product / service) provides us with the data required for the calculation of the remuneration.
In addition to information about the purchased product [item number, value, time stamp, transaction status (executed, cancelled, etc.)], we receive information about the publisher who brokered this purchase.
In addition, we receive further data that enables an assignment to the advertiser and is a prerequisite for billing (details of the advertiser, ID of the brokered transaction, details for calculating the commission).
We require this information in order to determine the remuneration to be paid by the advertiser for the use of the platform or for the publisher.
This data is subject to statutory retention obligations (German Fiscal Code, German Commercial Code), so that deletion does not take place until 10 years after completion of the brokered purchase.
The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para.
1 p. 1 f) DSGVO.
2.
==========
marking of the end device by means of cookies.
In order for us to be able to assign a purchase brokered by the publisher to the respective customer, we store a cookie on the end device used by you with your consent.
This enables us to record the forwarding to an advertiser triggered by you clicking on the advertising material and to better record the assignment of a customer referred by the publisher to an advertiser.
This simplifies the calculation of a corresponding remuneration for us.
==========
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 para.
1 sentence 1 letter a DSGVO.
The cookies stored by iProspect are automatically deleted after 30 days.
4.
==========
reporting for publishers
In addition to billing, iProspect creates various anonymized reports for the publisher based on the available transaction data.
In doing so, iProspect uses the data that we can assign to a publisher based on his or her brokerage activities.
The publisher only receives an anonymized report and no individual information about the customer he referred.
In the context of creating reports, iProspect uses personal data that is not older than two years - related to the date of the mediated sale.
The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para.
1 p. 1 f) DSGVO.
5.
notes on the guarantee of data security
We take technical and operational security precautions on our pages to protect the personal data stored with us from access by third parties, loss or misuse and to enable secure data transfer.
