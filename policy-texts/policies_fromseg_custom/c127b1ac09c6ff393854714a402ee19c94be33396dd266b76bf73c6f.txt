Personal Abuse
Definition
Linking, referring to, uploading, posting, emailing or otherwise transmitting any Content that is threatening, abusive, tortious, defamatory, or libelous.
AdButler is one of the world's largest online services, and it should come as no surprise that users occasionally link, or otherwise refer to materials that someone may find objectionable.
Unfortunately, AdButler cannot evaluate the propriety of the hundreds of thousands of new advertisements, links, or referrals made on its service each day.
For example, we are simply not in any position to evaluate an allegation that a particular post is defamatory.
==========
It is for this reason that under United States federal law (47 U.S.C.), service providers like AdButler are not liable for content posted to their services by third parties.
Accordingly, AdButler will not, as a matter of practice, remove links or referrals based on allegations of abuse without legal process that AdButler reasonably believes compels a response.
By contrast, where a party presents a court order establishing that particular content is abusive and should be removed, AdButler will respond as it believes appropriate.
We will also respond appropriately to intellectual property claims, and may remove any post as we see fit, in accordance with our Terms of Service.
==========

AdButler GDPR Cookie Policy
AdButler has always embraced “Privacy by Design”, and because of this, we have a very small footprint on your users’ browsers.
AdButler only has a small number of features that involve cookies to carry out their respective functionalities.
These cookies do not store any personal data (including personal IDs) which means that you do not need to collect explicit consent from your users before using these AdButler features.

AdButler has always embraced “Privacy by Design”, and because of this, we have a very small footprint on your users’ browsers.
AdButler only has a small number of features that involve cookies to carry out their respective functionalities.
Both of these cookies do not store any personal data (including personal IDs) which means that you do not need to collect explicit consent from your users before using these AdButler features.
==========
Although the GDPR was not meant to address non-personal data, there was a misalignment on the implementation of two new regulations: GDPR and ePrivacy Regulation.
ePrivacy regulation was intended to replace the Data Protection Directive, which was repealed on May 25, 2018, but the ePrivacy Regulation has been delayed.
==========
In order to address the impending relatory gap that handles cookie privacy, a provision was added to the GDPR that says that references to the Data Protection Directive “shall be construed as references to this Regulation [the GDPR]”.
Because of this provision, and the fact that the Data Protection Directive addresses consent for cookies in general (not specifically those with personal data or IDs), there will be a period of time where GDPR transparency is required for cookies containing non-personal data.
Accordingly, you will need to disclose the following information to your EU users regarding these two cookies.

Please note that if you do not use AdButler Frequency Capping or AdButler Conversion Tracking, you do not need to disclose this information to your EU users.
AdButler GDPR Compliance
AdButler has been incorporating “Privacy by Design” since our inception, which has made our preparation to be GDPR compliant
relatively painless.
With GDPR having taken effect on May 25, 2018, we want to assure you that we are fully compliant with the regulation.
