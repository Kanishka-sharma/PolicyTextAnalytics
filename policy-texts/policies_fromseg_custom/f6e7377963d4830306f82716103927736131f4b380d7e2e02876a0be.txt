Real Cities Network Privacy Statement 
The Real Cities Network (or "RCN") is a national network of Internet site and services serving geographic and common interest communities across the United States.
The privacy policies described below are applicable to each site in the Real Cities Network.
You can view the sites included in the Real Cities Network at http://www.realcities.com.
How is my personally identifiable information used?
Our main goal is to provide you with a customized and targeted user experience within the Real Cities Network.
For instance, your personally identifiable information enables us to greet you when you return to a Real Cities site or service, and provide you with news and services we think will be of interest to you.
==========
We review our users' preferences, demographics, traffic patterns, and other information in the aggregate so that we can better understand who our audience is, and what it is you want.
Tracking user preferences also helps us serve you targeted advertising.
Targeted advertisements are probably more interesting for you, and are definitely more productive for our advertisers.
If a local grocery market wants to advertise an upcoming sale, we can target the ad to registered users who live near that grocery market.
==========
Please note that we do not share your personally identifying information with the advertiser.
We use a third party to serve ads when you visit our site.
This third party ad server may use certain information about your visit to our site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you, but they are not entitled to collect or use personally identifiable information about you i.e., your name, address, email address or telephone numbers).
We, or third party ad servers, acting on our behalf, act as the middleman between you and the advertisers that want to reach you.
==========
We use the information we collect in non-intrusive common sense ways, like using your credit card number to provide you with products and/or services that you request.
All credit card information is transmitted in an encrypted form, using SSL (secure socket layer) encryption, the industry-standard.
Although, we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personal information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure.
The RCN assumes no liability for disclosure of data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized third parties.
==========
Finally, if you register for one or more of our sites or services, from time to time, we will send information to you via e-mail about our products and services, or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you.
If you do not wish to receive these mailings, you can simply check off the appropriate box when you register, or update your profile at any time after registration so you no longer receive such offers and mailings.
Please check the registration screens applicable to the service, promotion, or product offering for which you are signing-up for specific instructions on how to update your user profile and/or opt out of receiving offers and mailings.
Also, please remember that third party vendors also sell products and services on the Real Cities network, and their policies may differ from ours.
==========
Cookies.
The RCN uses cookies to store and track your preferences to provide you with a more personalized user experience.
Third party advertisers and our ad server may set and access their cookies on your computer in accordance with their own privacy policies.
==========
A cookie is a message that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.
Most Internet sites use cookies.
You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies (see below) but then you will not be able to participate in most customized services, and you may be required to repeatedly type in your personally identifying information in order to participate in various services, promotions, or product offerings.
==========
Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences, purchases, and passwords.
For example if you choose "Automatic Login" during registration, the RCN will store a scrambled version of your username in a permanent "cookie" file on your hard drive so that we can track your personalized services and preferences from one visit to the next.
We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all.
These cookies, help us estimate our audience size, determine which areas of the RCN are the most popular, and serve targeted advertising.
