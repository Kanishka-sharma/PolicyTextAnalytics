Alternative Minimum Tax Relief based on Effective Tax Administration is before the United States Tax Court
By Brian Isaacson
High income and increasing numbers of middle income taxpayers are finding themselves ensnared by the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Originally enacted in 1969 to apply to wealthy taxpayers who were using loopholes to escape tax altogether, the AMT is now projected to affect nearly 35 million taxpayers in 2010.1 Yet most taxpayers subject to the AMT do not know it before they prepare their taxes.
As a result, many taxpayers discover too late that they underpaid their tax and are therefore subject to a penalty for failure to pay sufficient estimated tax.

Random Term From The Legal Dictionary
Postal rule
A rule of contract law that makes an exception to the general rule that an acceptance is only created when communicated directly to the offeror.
An acceptance is binding and the contract is said to be perfected when the acceptor places this acceptance in the mail box for return mail even if, in fact, it never reaches the offeror.
An 1892 British case summarized it as follows: "Where the circumstances are such that it must have been within the contemplation of the parties that, according to the ordinary usages of mankind, the post might be used as a means of communicating the acceptance of an offer, the acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted."
