Thank you for visiting the White House Website and reviewing our privacy
                policy.
Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect  no personal
                information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide
                that information to us.
Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website: 
 Information Collected and Stored Automatically
If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read
                pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information
                about your visit automatically.
This information does not identify you
                personally.
We automatically collect and store only the following
                information about your visit:


The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
                         private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a
                         university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is
                         automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from
                         which you access our website; 

The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
                         

The date and time you access our site; 

The pages you visit; and 

If you linked to the White House website from another website, the
                         address of that website.
We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors
                -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of
                technology our visitors use.
We do not track or record information about
                individuals and their visits.
If You Send Us Personal Information
If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an e-mail
                to the President, Vice President or someone else, or by filling out a form with
                your personal information and submitting it to us through our website -- we use
                that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the
                information you have requested.
We treat emails the same way we treat letters
                sent to the White House.
==========
We are required to maintain many documents under the
                Presidential Records
                Act for historical purposes, but we do not collect personal information for
                any purpose other than to respond to you.
We only share the information you
                give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency,
                or as otherwise required by law.
Moreover, we do not create individual profiles
                with the information you provide or to give it to any private organizations.
The White House does not collect information for commercial marketing.
==========
Links to Other Sites 
Our Website has links to many other federal agencies.
In a few cases we
                link to private organizations, with their permission.
Before leaving the White
                House website, a page will appear informing you that you are leaving our
                server.
Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of
                the new site.
Kids' Page
We at the White House are especially concerned about protecting
                children's privacy.
==========
We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's
                Internet explorations.
It is particularly important for parents to guide their
                children when children are asked to provide personal information on line.
The
                White House homepage for kids encourages children to send email messages to the
                White House.
We ask children to type their name, email address, and home
                mailing address as part of their message so that we can respond personally to
                them.
==========
Providing this information is entirely optional.
We specifically ask
                children to get their parents' permission before providing any information on
                line -- at our site or any other site -- and hope parents will always be
                involved in those decisions.
Most importantly, when children do provide
                information through the White House website, it is only used to enable us to
                respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children.
