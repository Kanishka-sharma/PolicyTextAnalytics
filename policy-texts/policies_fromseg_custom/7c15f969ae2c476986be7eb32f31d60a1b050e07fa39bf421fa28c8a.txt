A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.
A website can use cookies to recognize repeat users or track web usage behavior.
Cookies take up minimal room on your computer and cannot damage your computer&#39s files.
Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.
Users of the Website should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by virtue of the standard operation of Drizly&#39s computer servers or through the use of cookies.
If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies.
There may, however, be some features of the Service which require the use of cookies in order to customize the delivery of information to you.

The use of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.

<br/><br/> HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<br/> To Provide the Service<br/> We use the information that we collect from you to provide you with the Service, support and enhance your use of the Service, to monitor which features of the Service are used most, to allow you to view your purchase history, to allow you to view any promotions we may currently be running, to allow you to rate purchases, and to determine which features we need to focus on improving.
If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.
<br/><br/> If you download the App and the Service is not available in your geographic location, you will have the option to provide us with your email address and zip code so that we may notify you when the Service becomes available in your geographic location.
If you choose to provide us with this information, we will use it solely for this notification purpose.
<br/><br/> We also use usage patterns and geographic locations to determine to which retailer we should send a user&#39s order for fulfillment, and where we should offer or focus services, features and/or resources.
We may also track your past purchases to provide you with a personalized profile of your shopping history.
In addition, Drizly may notify you about new services or special promotional programs, or send you offers or information.

<br/><br/> We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) in the aggregate, so that we can improve the Website and for business and administrative purposes.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information means information that may correspond to a particular person, account, or profile, but that is not sufficient to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains.
We may also use or share with third parties for any purpose aggregated data that does not contain personally identifiable information.

We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.
==========
<br/><br/> Targeted or Behavioral Advertising<br/> Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited, the searches they have made, the type of device they have used, or the orders they have placed.
This information is then used to select which advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual via the Service.
For example, if you have shown a preference for a type of beverage while using the Service, you may be served an advertisement via the Service relating to that type of beverage.

These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf.

==========
<br/><br/> Law Enforcement<br/> Drizly cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Drizly or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
<br/><br/> Acquisition of Drizly<br/> In the event that all or a substantial portion of the assets, business or stock of Drizly are acquired by, merged with or transferred to another party, or in the event that Drizly goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, your personal information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by the third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Drizly or its assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If any acquirer of Drizly or its assets will use your personal information contrary to this Privacy Policy, you will receive prior notice.

Please note that your friends and contacts may still choose to send email invitations to you.
Any user who receives an email invitation to join the Service may choose not to receive such invitations in the future by following the instructions in the email invitations and, in addition, if you are a user, you may also choose not to receive such invitations by changing your preferences as indicated above.
We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may still receive communications from us for up to 30 days as we process your request.

However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet, and any information you transmit to Drizly you do at your own risk.
