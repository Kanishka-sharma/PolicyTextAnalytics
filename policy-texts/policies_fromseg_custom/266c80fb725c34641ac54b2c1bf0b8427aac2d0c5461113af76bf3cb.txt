Avoiding Internet Fraud
Fraudulent scams called "phishing" have been increasing in frequency.
"Phishing" involves a victim receiving an e-mail appearing to be from a legitimate business.
The "from" line is often forged and the e-mail usually contains authentic looking graphics making it appear to be legitimate.
The e-mail may also contain what appears to be a legitimate link to that organization, e.g., http://www.seattle.gov/.
When the victim clicks on this link, they are then taken to what appears to be a legitimate looking website.
Criminals can even make your browser's address bar contain the address of the legitimate organization despite the fact that the website is a forgery.
==========
Victims are then encouraged to enter personal information including credit card numbers and expiration dates.
We will not request confidential personal or financial information from our customers via an unsolicited e-mail.
The City will also never send you an unsolicited e-mail containing a link to a City website where confidential personal or financial information is requested.
If you receive such an e-mail, purportedly from the City, you are encouraged to immediately contact the City's Citizen Service Bureau at: (206) 684-CITY.
For more general information about "phishing" visit the Federal Trade Commission web site.
For specific information about a suspected phishing attempt, you may have received contact the organization represented in the suspect e-mail.

Please note that we will be updating our forms over time to contain these disclosures.

Emergency response 
In certain public safety and emergency response situations, we collect biometric data, including fingerprints and health related measurements such as heart rate or blood pressure.
In some cases, we also employ facial recognition technology to assist in public safety response.
==========
Due to the individualized and serious nature of emergency response efforts, a variety of personal information may be collected by first responders and other personnel, as needed, and such data collection, use and disclosure practices may fall outside of the scope of this Privacy Statement.
Emergency call centers may also follow different protocols in the course of responding to emergency calls.
Whenever possible, our emergency responders will attempt to honor the Privacy Principles and this Privacy Statement when collecting, using, storing or sharing personal information.
==========
We share information to coordinate delivery of services to the public, improve customer service, maintain data consistency, assess program performance, identify opportunities to improve our operations and because we are required to by law.
We may also share information that has been aggregated or de-identified.
To learn about how we share personally identifiable information, please click on the links below:
Third-parties
We also share information with third parties who provide services on behalf of the City.
For example, the City contracts with third parties to process financial transactions, technology companies that provide cloud and managed services, and analytics companies that measure traffic visiting the City's websites.
In doing so we comply with state and federal laws and follow information security practices to protect both physically and electronically stored and transmitted data.
We do not sell personal information to third parties for marketing purposes or for their own commercial use.
Government Agencies
We may share information with other government agencies, external service providers, researchers, contracted vendors, and others to perform city functions and comply with applicable laws.
==========
We ask third parties to abide by our privacy principles when handling data provided by the City.
In many cases, we require compliance through contractual obligations that include:

Providing notice when information is collected and used on our behalf by contracted third parties.
Directing that contracted third parties agree to and follow our contractual privacy requirements.
==========
Public Records Act
In the State Of Washington, Public Disclosure laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access records and information possessed by City government, as appropriate (The Public Records Act or "PRA" RCW 42.56).
The PRA requires the disclosure of public records unless a particular record (or particular information contained in a record) is specifically exempt from public access under the PRA or other applicable law.
For example, there is no categorical exemption for residential telephone numbers, residential addresses, or personal e-mail addresses and therefore these data elements may be made public under the PRA.
However, the PRA does not require the disclosure of "credit card numbers, debit card numbers, electronic check numbers, card expiration dates, or bank or other financial account numbers supplied to [the City] for the purpose of electronic transfer of funds, except when disclosure is expressly required by law."
==========
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the Public Records Act or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will determine our obligation.
This means the City may be required to disclose your information in the event of a Public Disclosure Request; however, we will consider what information may be exempted before responding to a request.
Open Data Program
For the purpose of government transparency, and consistent with the intent of the Public Records Act, the City posts some data sets to our Open Data portal, data.seattle.gov.
This allows the public to view, access and use information gathered by the City for a variety of purposes, from research to technology innovation.
==========

The City's web site has many links to other websites.
These include links to web sites operated by other government agencies, nonprofit organizations and private businesses.
When you link to another site, you are no longer on the City's website and this Privacy Statement will not apply.
==========
When you link to another website, you are subject to the privacy policy of that new site.

Neither the City, or any department, officer, or employee of the City warrants the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of any information published by this system, nor endorses any content, viewpoints, products, or services linked from this system, and shall not be held liable for any losses caused by reliance on the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of such information.
