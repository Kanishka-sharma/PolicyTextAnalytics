CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT 
                    The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.
If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe in good faith that materials hosted by AETN infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send AETN a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked by providing AETN’s Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail): 

A      physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf      of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; 
Identification      of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted      works at a single online Web site are covered by a single notification, a      representative list of such works at that Web site; 
Identification      of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of      infringing activity, and that is to be removed or access to which is to be      disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the AETN to      locate the material; 
Information      reasonably sufficient to permit the AETN to contact you, such as a name,      address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address; 
A      statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in      the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its      agent, or the law; and 
A      statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under      penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner      of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send AETN a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to this website should be sent to AETN's Copyright Agent: 
                    David Sternbach, Litigation & Intellectual Property Counsel
                    A&E Television Networks, LLC, 235 East 45th Street, New York, NY 10017

                    Email: copyright@aetn.com

                    AETN suggests that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
For clarity, only DMCA notices and counter-notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to AETN online customer service or you can reach AETN by telephone at 212.424.7122.
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.
