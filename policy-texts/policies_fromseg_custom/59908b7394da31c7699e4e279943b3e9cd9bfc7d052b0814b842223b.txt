Document Accessibility

The Census Bureau is committed to making every document on its Internet server accessible to all.
Currently, we are reviewing our site and making modifications to those pages which are not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
We use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to create pages that are generally accessible to persons using screen reading devices, and we are careful in our construction of HTML documents to ensure maximum accessibility.
==========
We include alternate text describing graphics.
Many Census Bureau Internet documents are in ASCII or HTML formats.

These documents are accessible to persons using screen reading software.
We also have a large number of documents in Adobe Acrobat PDF (Portable Document Format) files.
Currently, many people using screen reading devices cannot read documents in PDF format.
Adobe Systems, Inc., is producing various products designed to make Adobe Acrobat documents accessible to persons using screen reading software.
