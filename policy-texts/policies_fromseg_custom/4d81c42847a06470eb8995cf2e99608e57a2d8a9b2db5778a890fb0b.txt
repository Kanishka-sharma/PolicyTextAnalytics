About IP Addresses
PlasmaNet collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web.
Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
When players request pages from PlasmaNet websites, our servers log the players' IP addresses.
We do not link IP addresses to anything that would identify you personally.
This is for logging purposes, but you remain anonymous to us.

What are cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your registration, passwords, and references while you're at our site.
The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites.
By "looking" for a cookie our server can determine whether or not you have already registered to play.
Cookies help our server to know when you are playing, so that you don't need to register each time you play.
==========
Cookies also help us to serve you better.
Through the use of cookies we can better understand what information interests you; providing more of what you like and want from FreeLottoTM.
Some examples of how we use cookies:
A cookie lets our computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites.
==========
Think of it as a membership card.
Similarly, the cookie tracks which of our sponsors you've visited so that we can constantly introduce you to new and interesting sponsors.
Use of cookies to do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again.
If you decline cookies, you may have difficulty playing your selections and adversely impacts your FreeLottoTM experience.
What FREELOTTOTM cookies don't do.
We never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

You may get cookies from our advertisers.
PlasmaNet and FreeLottoTM do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the PlasmaNet cookies policy.
The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
You may review our advertisers' privacy policies when visiting their sites.
