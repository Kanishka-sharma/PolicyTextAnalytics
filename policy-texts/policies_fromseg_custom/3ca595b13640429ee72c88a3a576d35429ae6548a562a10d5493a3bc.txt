TO WHOM DO WE TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

==========
However,
	in addition to the assignments that we specifically indicate in the section

	that affect all the previous treatments and its legitimizing base.
MARFEEL group of companies: Personal data may be shared with the
			rest of the Marfeel group of companies (specifically: MARFEEL
			COLOMBIA, SAS - Colombia-) for the purposes of management and
			technical support of the group.
Some of the group's companies are
			located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which is why
			international transfers of your data take place.
In this sense,
			Marfeel has implemented the appropriate procedures and mechanisms
			to be able to carry out such transfers, as explained in the
			following section.
==========
Providers of essential services to execute the service we offer
			you, (for example, computer hosting companies or platforms to send
			commercial communications).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these
			entities have signed the corresponding confidentiality agreements
			and will only process your data according to our instructions, not
			being able to use them for their own purposes or apart from the
			service they provide us.
==========
Public organisms.
We may disclose to the competent public
			authorities the data and any other information that is in our
			possession or that is accessible through our systems when there is
			a legal obligation to do so, as well as when it is required, for
			example, when the purpose is that of prevent or prosecute abuse of
			services or fraudulent activities through our Website or web page.
In these cases, the personal data that you provide us would be kept
			and made available to the administrative or judicial authorities.
In the event of a corporate transaction: In the event of a merger,
			acquisition, sale of all or part of its assets or any other type of
			corporate transaction involving a third party, we may share,
			disclose or transfer user data to the successor entity (including
			during the pre-transaction phase).
To third parties after aggregation or anonymization: we may
			disclose or use aggregated or anonymized data (that is, which is
			not linked to an identified or identifiable natural person) for any
			purpose.
To third parties with the consent of the user or another legitimate
			basis: In the event that we want to share data with third parties
			outside the scope of this Privacy Policy, data subject consent will
			be requested, in any case, or they will be informed about it and
			its legitimate basis.
Likewise, we inform you that this Privacy Policy only refers to the
	collection, processing and use of information (related to personal data) by
	us through the interaction you make with our Website.
==========
Access to third-party

	own privacy policies over which we have no control.
Therefore, before
	providing them with any personal information, we recommend that you inform
	yourself about their Privacy Policies.

==========
IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA TRANSFERRED TO THIRD COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE
	ECONOMIC AREA?
As indicated in the previous section, some of the Marfeel group companies
	are located in countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”):
 
	In addition, some of our service providers may also be located outside the
	EEA.
==========
The location of these companies outside the EEA implies the existence of an
	international transfer of your personal data, which could entail a lower
	degree of protection than that contained in European regulations.
However,
	at MARFEEL we have applied measures so that said transfers do not give rise
	to a lower degree of protection of your personal data.
In this sense, all have signed the corresponding standard contractual
	clauses approved by the European Commission (“SCC”), an agreement signed
	between both entities by which the non-EU company guarantees that it
	applies European data protection standards.
Therefore, the use of these providers does not give rise to a lower degree
	of protection of your personal data than the use of providers located in
	the European Union.
You can check the content of the SCC in the following
	link:
 
	https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contractstransfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
