No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information
        Our web site does not track, collect or distribute personal information 
        about visitors.
We regularly compile aggregate statistics that show the 
        number of visitors to our site, the requests we receive for particular 
        information on our web site, and the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) 
        that those requests come from.
These aggregated statistics are used by 
        internal APA technical support staff to improve the website in an ongoing 
        effort to provide better information and services to the public.
