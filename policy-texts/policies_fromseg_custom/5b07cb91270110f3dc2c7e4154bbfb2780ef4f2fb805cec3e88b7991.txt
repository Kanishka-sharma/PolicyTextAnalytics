MARKETING
From time to time we will ask you whether you wish to receive marketing material from Dugout containing information about our services and partners.
You can always tell us that you do not wish to receive direct marketing communications from Dugout.
==========

If you would prefer not to receive direct marketing communications from us, simply let us know at any time by contacting us using the details below or by following the opt out instructions in the relevant communication.
==========
Please note that this will not stop you from receiving service messages from us.
We may use information which we hold about you to show you relevant advertising on third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter among other third party publisher sites).
This could involve showing you an advertising message where we know you have used Dugout products and services.
If you do not want to be shown targeted advertising messages from Dugout, some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers on that site in future.
If you want to stop all personalised services from Dugout, including targeted advertising messages on third party sites you can block Cookies through your browser or device settings or contact us for further advice.
For further information see www.youronlinechoices.com
As part of its marketing efforts, Dugout and advertisers also use cookies to make online adverts more relevant to you, and enable Publishers to sell advertising space on their sites.
==========
We do this by matching and combining data, and gaining audience insights - this involves giving you a unique ID, and comparing our unique IDs with those of our trusted partners (such as Publishers, advertisers and third party suppliers that we work with).
We use advertising match partners such as Lotame to enable us to do this.
If your information is matched to information on the database of any of our trusted partners, we may combine this with the information we have about you.
==========
This helps to create a more rounded view of your demographic and content preferences.
To do this, we would make assumptions about your interests based on the way you interact with websites and the information we obtain about you, adding you to groups that have indicated similar interests and preferences.
For example if you view a Liverpool video on our site and our partner's site we might identify you as a user who may be interested in receiving more Liverpool content.
==========
