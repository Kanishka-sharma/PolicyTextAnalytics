Cookies
A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive following an Economist.com visit.
This file subsequently allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site by keeping a record of your previous visit(s).
It is used to identify first time users from previous visits and is only used for ID purposes and tracks a user's sessions.
==========
A subscriber will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them.
We do not link this information to users' personal details.
Cookies can be deleted from a PC's hard drive at any time by the user.
Further information on the use of cookies can be found on http://cookiecentral.com


Security Policy
Economist.com will maintain appropriate measures to ensure that users' personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered within the Economist Group server environment.
==========
Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside the Economist Group to other data processors (i.e. fulfilment bureaux, database consultants etc.) but they will only act upon instruction from the Economist Group in order to perform the services required.
Transfer of Personal Data Overseas
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.
Therefore, by browsing Economist.com and communicating electronically with us you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.

It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of products.

The Economist Group do not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13.
When necessary underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent of guardian has informed us that these details have been collected.
