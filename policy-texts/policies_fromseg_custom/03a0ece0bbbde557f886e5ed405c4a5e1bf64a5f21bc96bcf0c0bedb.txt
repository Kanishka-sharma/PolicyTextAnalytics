Ad Serving Data.
==========
Adludio collects, processes, uses, discloses or retains information about End Users in the context of their exposure or interaction with an ad.
We may also collect information on behalf of our customers which may be an brand/advertiser, publisher, advertising agency and/or their agents, in the context of fulfilling our service to them.
==========
Ad Serving Data includes standard digital advertising metrics as defined by industry bodies such as the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), including number of ads viewed, time spent viewing an ad, page views, video views, number of ads clicked, IP address, device ID, GPS coordinates, advertising identifiers (IDFA/AAID).
It may also include Personal Information that you actively choose to share with us through text field forms, and other information about your interaction with the ads.
==========
End User information may be used for lawful advertising purposes to provide you with a more tailored online advertising experience.
It may also be used by Adludio to improve the functionality of our services.
In this context, Adludio may collect, process, uses, disclose or retain information about End Users in the following manners:
Bidder Data -- Adludio serves as a “Data Processor” in the context of user targeting and media buying in a programmatic environment, whereas the Bidder makes available information that is covered by consent passed on by the Bidder or Bidder suppliers.
RTB -- Adludio may use Ad Serving Data to optimise the performance of the ad campaigns we are bidding for using a Real-Time Bidding Platform.
==========
For every relevant auction we receive a bid request.
This request is sent over HTTPS and is processed by our servers inside protected AWS VPC.
After we reply to the bid request we delete the request data.
Reporting Logs -- When we buy inventory using a Bidder, we receive logs with details about auctions we won.
This data is sent to us using secure channels using tools like AWS S3 and AWS Kinesis.
This data contains End User IP addresses, locations, browser details, websites name, app name, and all bid-related details, and we may use it for campaign optmisation and reporting purposes.
You can read more about the Bidder Data we receive at https://docs.beeswax.com/docs/data-feeds.
==========
Adludio Engagement Data -- In addition to standard digital advertising metrics, Adludio also tracks “user engagements” that form the core offering of Sensory Ads.
Every time an ad is loaded in the user browser or app environment, Adludio tracks a set of events triggered by the engagement (including engagement gesture, clicks, skips, etc).
We send this data with auction_id back to our servers over the HTTPS channel.
==========
Third Party Tracking -- Adludio may implement third-party performance tracking mechanism, such as click-through links and tracking pixels, per the request of our clients who receive and may share with us daily aggregated reports, used to monitor the performance of the campaigns.
These mechanisms may store user IP address, store a cookie in the user browser and get information about the browser.
Cookies -- Adludio doesn’t stre any cookies in End User browsers in the context of Ad serving.
However, the Bidder (used t buy ad inventory) and its supplies may store cookies in the End User browser to profile inventory, to fulfill targeting requirements.
For this use, Adludio does not target individual (identifiable) users, we only focus on the environmental variables like type of device, domain name and geographical location of the user.
Third party tools may also store cookies in the End User browser to help measure and monitor the ad campaign performance accurately.
These cookies are governed by the third party and/or domain (publisher) terms.
Aggregated Reporting -- In order to fulfill our service proposition, Adludio aggregates raw Bidder Data and Adludio Engagement Data for monitoring, optimisation and reporting purposes.
==========
Aggregation is usually executed in the form of daily sums and/or campaign lifecycle totals.
Aggregated reports are used to track performance and delivery of campaigns, and are shared with our clients (the advertiser) as part of our contractual obligations.
Adludio’s customers and/or partners (collectively “Third Parties”) may also use cookies to customise the End User online advertising experience, based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the information collected.
Our customers (the advertiser) may use cookies to serve appropriate ads to you and to help track results or measure effectiveness of those ads.
==========
Third Parties may also combine information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you with other information they have independently collected over time across different online environments, including syncing or connecting behavior across different websites, mobile apps or devices.
These Third Parties collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
==========
Storage of Ad Serving Data
Ad Serving Data is stored in AWS data centres in AWS North Virginia (USA) and the Republic of Ireland.
There are two types of Ad Serving Data
Raw Data -- Information we collect via the Bidder (containing IP address, locations and details about the user browser) and tracking logs we store in encrypted S3 buckets with appropriate access control policies.
We keep Raw Data for 90 days.
==========
This allows us to check and ensure that the relevant and subsequent aggregations are correct.
Aggregated Data -- Aggregated (non-identifiable) information is stored in secured and encrypted databases in the AWS data centres.
==========
At this stage we no longer store IP addresses, device IDs and location we have received from the Bidder.
We may store aggregated data indefinitely or as long as normal business operations will require.
==========
If you have any concerns about or would like to opt-out from Ad Serving Data you can contact Adludio at info@adludio.com for further information, or contact the Bidder directly at privacy@beeswax.com per the Bidder Privacy Policy guidelines.
