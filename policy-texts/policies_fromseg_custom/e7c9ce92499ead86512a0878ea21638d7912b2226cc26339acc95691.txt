Privacy Policy
        

          Last update on April 19, 2011.
Gravity's mission is to build the internet's Interest Graph and enable amazing, personalized experiences anywhere on the web without compromising each person's right to privacy.
==========
Our business is based upon the collection and use of anonymous Interest Data (as defined below) via partner websites in order to allow publishers, advertisers, and other content providers to deliver content, media and advertising that is relevant and meaningful to their users.
Your interests may be used anonymously to influence which types of content or advertisements are displayed to you across partner sites that we work with.
==========
You may choose not to participate by opting out of our service.
This privacy policy is intended to inform you about our collection, use, and disclosure of information that is processed by the Gravity's Interest Graph services and applications.
==========
Overview of Our Services
        

          We collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users on web sites that use our services.
In this policy, we refer to this non-personally identifiable information, together with other non-personally identifiable information that we obtain from third parties, as "Interest Data."
Interest Data is anonymous and does not include personally identifiable information such as your name, email address or phone number.
==========
We process Interest Data to create Interest Graphs (an online representation of your interests) for users based upon their behaviors and preferences.
We give our customers a limited right to use users' Interest Graphs in order to understand their users better and/or deliver personalized experiences (e.g., content, advertising) to their users based on their interests.
==========
If you create an account directly with Gravity we may collect volunteered personally identifiable information such as your name, email, password, or social identity (e.g., Facebook).
Unless you explicitly consent to do so, we will not associate your Interest Graph with any such personally identifiable information.
We will not share any personally identifiable information without first obtaining consent unless required by law.
Collection of Interest Data
        

          We use non-personally identifiable means, including "cookies" and "pixel tags," to collect and store Interest Data.
Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a browser.
==========
They are sent to a computer by web site operators or third parties.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
You may, however, be able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse third-party cookies or to indicate when a third-party cookie is being sent.
Check your browser's "Help" files to learn more about handling cookies on your browser.
==========
Pixel tags are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or other document.
Pixel tags allow the operator of the web page or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies on, and to transfer other data to, the browser used to view the web page or other document.
==========
Pixel tags may also be used to obtain information about the computer being used to view that web page or other document.
The entity that sends the tag can view the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the time it was sent, the user's operating system and browser type, and similar information.
We use information collected at various times and by pixel tags and cookies placed on web sites in order to collect Interest Data.
==========
We may also obtain Interest Data from third-party sources, and may combine it with other Interest Data that we have collected.
The Interest Data that we collect from users includes the contents of pages of the web sites that a user visits and other click-stream data, none of which includes personal information about the user.
In addition, we may collect information about the users' web browser or operating system.
Use of Interest Data
        

          We analyze Interest Data collected from various sources and at different times in order to build user Interest Graphs.
==========
All Interest Data has a limited lifetime, and naturally decays over time.
We are aware of the sensitivity of certain types of Interest Data.
We do not intentionally collect or retain Interest Data that we consider sensitive.
==========
We presently treat Interest Data as sensitive if it includes data reflecting a user having any medical or health condition; certain aspects of a user's personal life or financial situation; or use of, or interest in, gambling, alcoholic beverages, or "adult" products or services.
We may update from time to time the types of Interest Data that we consider sensitive.
==========
Disclosure of Interest Data
        

          We disclose Interest Data, and information derived from Interest Data, to our customers in the ordinary course of our business.
We provide our customers with access to Interest Data through our applications and API.
==========
For example, we may determine that a user is interested in baseball because the user frequently reads baseball articles on web pages that are operated or controlled by a customer.
Our customer may use this information to recommend baseball content to the user or target them with appropriate advertisements.
==========
We do not authorize our customers to resell or sublicense Interest Data to third parties.
Please note that our customers have their own data retention policies.
We may share Interest Data with third-party service providers (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) in order for those service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf.
We may also disclose Interest Data if we believe that we have a legal obligation to do so.
In addition, information in our possession or control, including Interest Data, may be disclosed in connection with any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or other business transaction in which data could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.
Opting Out of the Services
        

          We provide multiple ways for you to opt out of our services.
==========
We make available a Gravity "opt-out" cookie that you may download to your browser.
This cookie, when installed on your browser, will prevent us from collecting Interest Data on that browser.
You can learn more about our opt-out cookie here.
==========
Additionally, you may prevent us from collecting Interest Data on a browser by blocking third-party cookies in that browser and deleting any existing Gravity cookies.
If you block third-party cookies from being set on your browser, you may not be able to enjoy some features or functionality of, and you may see the same content and advertisements repeatedly on, some Web sites.
==========
Reporting
        

          We may provide reports to our customers that contain Interest Data.
Our customers may use these reports to determine information about their users and for other purposes.
These reports are prepared by aggregating Interest Data on the web sites on which it is collected.
To prepare our reports, we maintain log files.
Our reports and log files do not include any personally identifiable information about users.
Children
        

          We do not intentionally collect Interest Data from children under 13 years of age.
==========
Data Security
        

          We employ a variety of security measures designed to protect Interest Data from unauthorized access, use or sharing, but no security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Interest Data or other information.
==========
Updates to This Policy
        

          We may update this policy from time to time.
When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the beginning of the policy.
We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose Interest Data.
