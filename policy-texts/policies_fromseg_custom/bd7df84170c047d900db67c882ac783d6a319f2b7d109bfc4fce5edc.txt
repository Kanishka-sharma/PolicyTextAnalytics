Information We Collect
A. Personally Identifiable Information.
In general, Say Media does not collect personally identifiable information on the Say Media Services, except as set forth below.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personally identifiable information" is data intended to be used to identify, contact or locate a person, including, name, address, telephone number or e-mail address and any other information (even if non-personally identifiable) provided in combination with such personally identifiable information.
==========
The advertisements we deliver may offer the ability to interact, including playing a game or viewing a video.
The ad may also give you the opportunity to provide the advertiser with information about yourself.
In some instances, if you choose to interact with an advertisement or provide an advertiser with information about yourself, Say Media may collect information on behalf of the advertiser.
In that case, the advertiser's privacy policy would apply to the data collected and we will abide by the instructions given to us by the advertiser in our handling of the data.
Say Media will not associate any information (non-personally identifiable or personally identifiable) we collect for an advertiser with any other information we may have collected about you through the Say Media Services.
B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
==========
When you visit the websites of third parties such as advertisers, third-party advertising networks, third-party advertising serving companies, and Say Media business partners, vendors and service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "non-personally identifiable information" is data that is not personally identifiable.
Say Media and these third parties may implement certain technologies to enable the collection of such information.
An explanation of these technologies is below.
==========
Cookies Information: The Say Media Services may send one or more cookies—a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters—to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.
A cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Say Media Services.
Say Media uses session, persistent, Flash and browser cookies.
The use of cookies by Say Media does not allow us to gather personally identifiable information about you.
==========
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to a website.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions.
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
==========
However, some features of the Say Media Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

Device Identifiers: When you access the Say Media Services by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers."
Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device and are used by Say Media to enhance your use of the Say Media Services.
A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Say Media.
==========
A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse the Say Media Services.
A device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you.
However, a device identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information.
A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Say Media Services.
Some features of the Say Media Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled.
Location Data: When you access the Say Media Services by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.
==========
Location data may convey information to us about how you browse the Say Media Services.
Location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you.
However, location data may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information.
Some features of the Say Media Services, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
==========
Web Beacons/Click-Stream Data: A web beacon is an electronic file that signals when a webpage, advertisement, video, other content, an email, or a newsletter has been viewed.
Say Media uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to collect click-stream data that helps us better understand how visitors move from page to page within websites.
As with cookies, our web beacons do not gather personally identifiable information about you.
Passive Browser Information: Say Media collects passive browser information though its web servers.
We use the passive browser information to help us understand how many visitors come to websites and where they come from, and ultimately to help us make decisions about how to deliver advertising.
==========
Demonstrations: Say Media periodically offers visitors to its websites the ability to see demonstrations of services offered by Say Media.
If you elect to view demonstrations, we may collect non-personally identifiable information in connection with the demonstration of the relevant service.
Our collection, storage and use of non-personally identifiable information in connection with such demonstrations are subject to this Privacy Policy.
==========
Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.
When you use the Say Media Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information.
These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, data about how you interact with links on the Say Media Services, and other such information.
We may display your IP address to the owners or maintainers of certain blogs, groups or communities if you post to those blogs, groups or communities and the owner or maintainer has enabled functionality for this purpose.
Scripts: A script is a short segment of computer code included in a web page or other content that can be used to set and access a cookie on your computer's hard drive and to record your activity on a website.
==========
Say Media may use scripts on third-party websites.
Third-Party Data Providers: Say Media may supplement the information it collects with other non-personally identifiable information provided by third-party data providers.
The information provided may include estimates of your age, gender and your interests, but does not include personally identifiable information.
Other Third-Party Service Providers: In connection with our services, Say Media may engage third parties to provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf.
In connection with those relationships, such third parties may collect data on our behalf.
==========
In that case, the third party would only collect and use such information as instructed by us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Third Party Use of Technologies: Third parties may set and access their own cookies, use their own web beacons, and use their own scripts on and through the Say Media Services or third-party websites.
How other companies use their own cookies, web beacons and scripts and the information they gather is subject to those companies' privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.
==========
C. Third Party Advertisements.
If an advertiser asks Say Media to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
In addition, third-party advertisers may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Say Media Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that they believe may be of interest to you.

Say Media may also store personally identifiable information and user content in locations outside the direct control of Say Media (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
We cannot control third parties' use of your information.
If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared in this way, you can choose not to participate in these events.
==========
B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
In the event that we use a third party to provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf, Say Media may share non-personally identifiable information with the third party to be used by them only for the purpose of providing their services to Say Media.
We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Say Media Services, and as part of the function of our business.
For example, we may share the number of ad views, ad clicks and content views to help calculate the payments due under the Program.

In the event that Say Media sells, transfers or otherwise relinquishes all or part of our assets, business offerings, or services, including any of the Say Media Services, information that you have shared with Say Media or that Say Media has collected, including both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information, may be one of the business assets that will be transferred.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information we collect, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
