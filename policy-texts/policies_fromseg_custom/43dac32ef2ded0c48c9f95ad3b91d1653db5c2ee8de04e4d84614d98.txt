Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy we provide this 
notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make 
about the way your information is collected and used.
==========
On some pages, you may enter your email adress (to register for a forum account, 
or to suscribe an opt-in mainling list).
We use the email you provide for notification 
of a response at a message you post on the forum, or for notification of news 
& events (mailing-list).
==========
We never use or share the email adress provided to 
us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.
Such addresses are 
not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
==========
We may use cookies to improve your web browsing experience, for example to 
avoid you typing your login/email adress at each message you post on the forum, 
or to keep your color settings.
Some outside parties (advertisers) may use cookies to understand the way a user 
responds to the ads they deliver.
==========
For example, to let them keep track of how many 
times you view an ad they distribute.
Likewise, the cookie can help make sure 
you do not see the same ad over and over.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your 
browser to prevent that use if you desire.
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please 
send us an email.
