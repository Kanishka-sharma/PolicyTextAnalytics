Your privacy is not for sale.
==========
Lookout will not share your personally identifiable, registration, or client device information or backup or location data with third-parties except under the following conditions:

If you have provided your express consent.
It is necessary to provide you with the Lookout products and services.
For example, we may share this information with subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of providing certain features of the Lookout Services and for processing such information on our behalf.
Some parties to whom we may disclose your information in order to provide you with Lookout products and services are our SMS service partners for the purpose of sending text messages to your phone; a location based map provider so that you may locate your phone if lost or stolen; a payment processor such as a credit card company or your wireless provider to bill you for goods and services; and a hosting provider to help administer customer support.
==========
We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information, and we require these parties to use any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
These third parties are not allowed to use your personal information for any other purpose.
We share encrypted (hashed) equipment identifier numbers with analytics services to understand how new users find out about our application.
==========
We are required to do so by law, or have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
We believe, in good faith, that it is appropriate or necessary to: enforce our Terms of Use; take precautions against liability; protect users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; assist government enforcement agencies; protect the security or integrity of the Lookout Services; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Lookout, users, or others.

==========
You can remove your data.
You always have the ability to close your account or prevent your data from being accessible through Lookout Services.
If you delete location data, it is anonymized on our production systems and there is no longer a link between your account and any saved location information.
If you delete backup data, that data will become inaccessible through your account.
If you delete your account, all information saved on your account becomes inaccessible.
The data that becomes inaccessible through your account may remain on our production servers for a period of time to enable you to recover your account or your data if you have accidentally deleted it.
If you have accidentally deleted information from your account, you may contact support@lookout.com as soon as possible to recover it.
Aggregate and anonymous information incorporating or derived from your data may remain on our servers indefinitely.
==========
For example, we may store a count of the number of devices that have ever encountered a particular piece of malware.
Your data may remain on a backup server or media indefinitely.
We perform backups to protect your data in the case of a problem with our production servers.
3.
==========
We limit our collection and use of your personal information.
We are committed to only collecting information that is necessary to provide you with Lookout services.
The information we collect is stored and associated with your account unless otherwise noted.
We take your privacy seriously and will only disclose this information under the terms described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy also identifies when we may store and/or release data in an anonymized aggregate form so that it cannot be associated with any individual user.
We collect some non-personal information from visitors to our website www.lookout.com.
Cookie Policy
Like many online services, we use cookies and other tools (including Google Analytics) to collect and analyze information about you and your usage of our Services.
==========
Cookies are just small data files that we transfer to your computer.
We use “session” cookies to keep you logged in while you use our Services, to better understand how you interact with our Services, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic information on our Services.
Session cookies disappear when you log out and close your browser.
We also use “persistent” cookies to recognize you when you return to our Services.
Persistent cookies stay on your computer for a longer time than session cookies do.
==========
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your settings or use third-party tools to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit.
You can also use your browser settings or other tools to delete cookies you already have.
Please be aware that some parts of our Services may not work for you if you disable cookies.
==========
Google Analytics for Display Advertisers
Lookout may use the remarketing and/or AdWords features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, which is a version of Google Analytics that is integrated with Google and Doubleclick display ad products and services.
In using Google’s Remarketing features, including Remarketing Lists, Lookout and Google use first-party cookies (like the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (like the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our web sites.
The purpose of these cookies is to remember you and your preferences so that third-party vendors with whom we partner (including Google) can market our services to you on other sites.
==========
We use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers so that we can learn about what you like and serve you ads that we think will be relevant and interesting.
However, if you do not want to share your information with Google, you may visit the Google Ads Preferences Manager or use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.
If you prefer not to use any cookies, you can opt-out in some browsers by turning on “Do Not Track” or visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ to opt-out directly.
==========
We collect limited personal information collected from visitors who create an account at lookout.com, download our application, or use our services.
The types of limited personal information we collect:
Registration information you provide.
You provide personally identifiable information including your email address and password to Lookout.
We use this information to create your Lookout account.
You may also enter your mobile phone number on our website to initiate a text message with directions on how to download the app and register.
Credit card information.
If you wish to upgrade to a premium account, in most cases we collect your credit card number, expiration date and security code.
==========
We use this information to bill you for services.
Client device information.
When you use the Lookout Services, our servers automatically record certain information about your mobile device.
This information may include information such as an equipment identifier (e.g. IMEI, UDID), subscriber identifier (e.g. IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, operating system type and version, wireless carrier / operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the dates and times of your requests.
We use this information to provide our services.
For example, collecting your device’s phone number allows the service to contact your phone via SMS when you locate your phone from the Lookout web application.
==========
Clear images.
We use an analytics service to measure how people use our web site so that we can improve our products.
The analytics service works by embedding invisible images that are associated with unique identifiers on our site.
We do not tie the information gathered through the use of clear images to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
==========
Information about your use of Lookout Software on your phone.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of Lookout Software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, and where the application was downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.
How we use the limited personal information information we collect from you:
Our purpose in collecting information from you is to provide you with, and to continue to improve and expand, the Lookout Products and Services.
We use your information to operate, maintain, and provide all of the features and functionality of the Lookout Services that you register for; to track and analyze your preferences and trends in order to improve the quality and design of the Lookout Services; and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services.
For example:
If you email fill out a survey or Lookout for support, we will retain that information to provide you with support and to improve Lookout Services.
Lookout may send text messages to your phone to communicate with your device and to provide download links.
==========
From time to time, Lookout uses your email address and/or mobile number for non-marketing or administrative purposes, such as sending privacy or security related notices, notifying you of major Lookout Services changes, or for other customer service purposes.
Lookout may use your email address to contact you regarding product announcements such as special promotions or new products and services.
You can choose to opt out of receiving these emails at any time by logging into your web account and changing your account preferences.
Where available, Lookout may use client device information to let you know you need to update your operating system.
==========
We collect additional personal information from visitors who choose to use additional services.
Your choices affect the collection and use of personal information so read carefully to understand what we collect for each service.
We currently offer a number of features you may choose to enable or disable.
If you choose to use these features, we may collect additional information in order to provide you with these services.
==========
SECURITY AND ANTI-VIRUS
Lookout Security and Anti-Virus products (available on different platforms) protect your device from malware and spyware.
They scan files and applications as they are installed or accessed, automatically scan your entire device on a periodic basis, and regularly update your threat definitions.
In order to perform these functions, we need to collect information about the applications and files present on your device, the results of any scans performed by our services, and actions you take as a result of scanning.
==========
This may include downloading entire copies of files on your device (though you can opt out of this feature and still use the Anti-virus product).
We use this information to provide you with the Security and Anti-Virus services (including providing you with a report of the security activity on your device on our web application and via email, and analyzing applications and files in the wild so that we can provide better protection from security threats); to help people better understand mobile applications and their devices; and to improve Lookout Services.
What types of information Security and Anti-Virus collect:
Information about the type of device you are using and the operating system you are running.
We collect information about the applications on your device, in order to conduct scans and to download them if you have not opted out of that functionality.
We also may collect information about how applications behave on your device (e.g. whether an application is sending premium-rate text messages that charge money to your phone bill) and the network services with which your applications communicate, in order to determine if any applications are behaving maliciously (e.g., whether an application is talking to a server known to host phishing websites).
Information about scans and scan results.
Each time Lookout performs a scan, we collect information that describes what files and applications are identified by the scan as potentially undesirable and your remediation choice (e.g. uninstall or ignore).
==========
How the information that Security and Anti-Virus collect is used:
Our purpose in collecting application data and security scan data is to provide you with Security and Anti-Virus.
We also use this data to optimize and improve this and other Lookout Services and Products.
We may aggregate your data with other customers’ data in non-personally identifiable form, in order to better understand current malware and spyware threats and to improve the Anti-Virus service.
We may also share this anonymous aggregated data publicly, in order to help others understand mobile threats and gain insights into particular mobile applications.
BACKUP
Lookout Backup stores copies of data that you choose to back up from your phone on a secure server.
The data may include your contacts, call history, pictures, text messages, and other data.
==========
Lookout Backup automatically backs up your data weekly or daily, based on your settings, restores your data to a new or existing phone, and allows you to retrieve your data any time at lookout.com.
What types of information Backup collects:
Backup Data.
Backup transmits a copy of the data on your device that you choose to back up to a server using an encrypted protocol.
How the information that Backup collects is used:
If you choose to use the Lookout Backup feature, we will use the data you provide to deliver the Backup service.
In order to notify you in the case of malicious behavior on your phone, Lookout may scan both the data that is stored on your phone and backed up to our servers.
For example, some malware has been known to spread via malicious text messages or steal money by dialing expensive phone numbers.
To detect this, our system would scan the SMS messages or call history stored on your phone or backed up on our servers.
==========
MISSING DEVICE
Lookout Missing Device helps you find and secure your phone if it is lost or stolen.
You can locate your phone on a map using location information provided by your phone, activate a loud siren even if your volume is turned down so that you can find a phone lost nearby, wipe your phone, or lock your phone.
Features and settings are controlled through our website at lookout.com.
What types of information Missing Device collects:
Location Data.
Lookout derives location information in two ways.
We may receive it directly from your mobile device, or, in some situations we may receive location data from cell tower or Wi-Fi hotspot information.
We may use third-party service providers to translate that information into usable location information.
How the information that Missing Device collects is used:
Our purpose in collecting this information is to provide you with the location of your phone when you request it.
If you activate the locate feature, your browser will send location information to Google Maps in order to display a map of the location within your Lookout account webpage.
When activating this feature, we track the phone’s location for several minutes in order to provide an accurate location for you.
==========
This information is retained in your account history for as long as you wish and may be deleted by you at any time within your account settings.
Once you choose to delete this information or disable your account, Lookout anonymizes this data so that it is no longer associated to an individual’s personal information.
We keep that anonymized data for aggregate statistical purposes only.
SAFE BROWSING
If supported on your device, Lookout Safe Browsing is a feature that identifies and warns you of unsafe websites so that you can choose to avoid visiting them.
What types of information Safe Browsing collects:
URLs.
To provide the Safe Browsing service, we may transmit the URLs you visit on your phone to a Lookout-provided or third-party service to determine if those URLs are unsafe (e.g., if the URLs contain phishing attacks, malwares, or exploits).
If a URL you visit is determined to be unsafe, we store a record of the unsafe URL.
How the information that Safe Browsing collects is used:
We use the record of unsafe URLs you visit (1) to provide you with notice that you attempted to reach an unsafe site (e.g. when you log in to the Lookout website or via email) and (2) to improve our product.
If you do not want us to record the unsafe URLs you visit, you may turn Safe Browsing off; all other Lookout features will continue to function.
==========
GROUP PLANS
Group Plans link multiple devices to one master account that controls the Group Plan owner’s device as well as certain features of devices associated with the Group Plan.
Users of the additional devices on the plan retain their own unique accounts.
What types of information Group Plans collect:
Lookout does not collect any additional information from users in Group Plans.
How the information that Group Plans collects is used:
In a Group Plan, such as a Family Plan, one user has authority to perform certain functions on devices belonging to other members of the group.
==========
For example, in a Family Plan, a parent phone may be able to lock, wipe, restore, or locate a child’s phone.
The latter would allow a parent to access data about the child’s phone as described in the section on “Missing Device.”
A parent phone, or other device having authority over other Group Plan users, generally does not have access to the data on a child’s phone unless, for example, the phone is restored to another device to which the parent phone has access.
Users must agree to give the “parent” this functionality.
==========
You can determine if your phone is part of a Group Plan by checking the settings functions in your phone.
Lookout does not share any personal information collected from use of the Lookout Services in Group Plans with its partners.
It may share aggregate anonymous information, for example, that 26% of users use Android phones or 64% of users use Motorola phones.
==========
LOCK CAM
Lookout’s Lock Cam feature uses your device’s camera and location features to help you figure out where your device might be (and who might have it) in the event that your device is lost or stolen.
If activated, Lock Cam  monitors when your password has been entered incorrectly a few times on your device or our app’s lock screen.
It then activates your device’s camera remotely, without sound or other notification, and sends the resulting picture and its GPS coordinates to the email address associated with your account.
For example, if someone steals your phone and fails to enter your password at least three times, Lock Cam  could allow you to see what they look like and figure out where they are without alerting them.
How to Activate Lock Cam
You must enable advanced protection on your phone in order to use Lock Cam.
==========
When you first download the feature, you will be asked to activate it.
You can disable or enable Lock Cam anytime using the Lookout settings.
Also, anytime you lock your phone using the Lookout app, you will be asked if you want to activate this functionality for the duration of the lock.
What types of information Lock Cam collects:
When Lock Cam is enabled on your device, Lookout will keep track of how frequently an incorrect password is entered.
We will use your device’s camera to take a picture when the limit for incorrect passwords is reached, and will collect location data from your device at the time the picture is taken.
Finally, we collect technical data about Lock Cam’s operation on your device.
How the information that Lock Cam collects is used:
When Lock Cam is activated and a photo is taken, the picture and location data are stored briefly on our servers so we can send you an email including the picture and a map of your device’s location to the address associated with your account.
==========
It is then deleted.
We use technical information about Lock Cam’s activities on your device only to study, optimize, and troubleshoot our products.
Please keep your email address up to date!
We send Lock Cam’s picture and location map to the email you provide.
You are responsible for keeping your email address correct and up to date to ensure that Lock Cam’s email goes to the right place.
==========
For Group Plans, the data will be sent to the email address associated with the device that takes the photo.
We are not responsible for pictures or location data sent to incorrect addresses.
