Online behavioral advertising with LinkedIn
		      The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to your website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp.
The IP addresses are truncated or (when used for reaching members across devices) hashed, and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous.
This remaining pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days.
==========
LinkedIn does not share the personal data with the website owner, it only provides reports (which do not identify you) about the website audience and ad performance.
LinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors (up to 90 days after the visit), enabling the website owner to show personalized ads off its website by using this data, but without identifying the member.
We also use data that does not identify you to improve ad relevance and reach members across devices.
LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings.
