Seagate Technology LLC and our affiliates (“Seagate”, “we”, “us”, “our”) respect your right to privacy and we have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected through this website ("Site"), how such information may be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and control its use in connection with our marketing communications and activities.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by using this Site you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
When you visit this Site, we may collect certain types of information from you, such as information that you voluntarily provide via forms, surveys, applications and through the use of various Seagate services or participation in various Seagate programs.
We may also collect information about you from your online browsing and transactions, including your preferences, pages visited, technical information regarding your computer and operating systems.
Information You Provide
In certain circumstances, you may be asked to provide us with some specific information about yourself in order to use certain features on this Site or to take advantage of certain opportunities that we may offer through this Site.
For example, we may collect personal contact, billing, and credit information when you register, sign up for services or purchase products.
Please note that the Seagate online store may be administered by a third party E-commerce service provider and the online store privacy policy may differ from this privacy policy.
We may also collect personal information in connection with the return of products, warranty and product registration, when you call or e-mail our customer service representatives, enter information on our Site, submit survey responses, participate in promotions, sweepstakes or contests or for the purposes of receiving information about our products, services and promotions
Information Automatically Collected
We automatically collect certain information, some of which may be associated with personal information, whenever you use our services or Site.
==========
For example, when your computer web browser or other communication device (including phone, PDA, etc.) accesses our Site, we automatically receive certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, date and time, and the web page you visited before visiting our Site.
This statistical data provides us with information about the use of this Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on this Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on.
We collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”, which are discussed in greater detail below.
We collect this information in order to determine which areas of this Site are most popular and to enhance this Site for visitors.
==========
From time to time we may also collect general, statistical information about information and data stored and shared through the personal servers and the services we provide to support personal servers (“Web Service”).
We may also group this information into aggregate data in order to describe the use of this Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request.
However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to this Site.
IP Addresses

An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when it accesses the Internet or another computer network.
Web servers and network devices automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to track the use of this Site.
==========
When visitors request pages from this Site, our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses.
It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.
However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with this Site’s policies or to protect our services, members, this Site, or others.
==========
Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a device accessing the Internet.
Seagate, or our third-party advertising service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your hard drive for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our site.
Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our site and pages visited.
Cookies allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Site.
We may also use cookies in online advertising to track consumer responses to Seagate advertisements and we may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites.
Cookies and similar files do not contain or capture unencrypted personally identifiable data.
You always have the option of disabling cookies using your browser preferences.
However, please be aware that some features of this Site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies.

Information Sharing
In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through this Site, and to respond to your inquiries, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that analyze data, provide customer service, advertisers, sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance (but such information will be shared only to the extent they need such information to perform their functions).
Your personally identifiable information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties to provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.
We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served on us; (c) to protect or defend our legal rights or property, this Site, or its users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of this Site’s users or the general public.
Except as provided herein, your personally identifiable information will not be provided to any third parties without prior approval from you.
==========
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.
If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to this Site, personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of this Site will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets.
Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.
Choice and Access
You may always direct us not to share your personally identifiable information with third parties, not to use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information or offers, or not to send you newsletters, e-mails or other communications by: (i) sending us an e-mail at webmaster@seagate.com; (ii) contacting us by mail at Seagate Technology LLC, 10200 South De Anza Boulevard, Cupertino, California 95014, USA, Attention: Webmaster; or (iii) following the removal instructions in the communication that you receive.
==========
Your opt-out request will be processed within 30 days of the date on which we receive it.
In addition to your normal access to your web account information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.
==========
Advertising
Seagate advertises on pages within the Site as well as on other websites not affiliated with Seagate.
We contract with advertising service providers who serve advertising to you through the use of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons.
Web beacons are small graphic images on a web page or on an HTML e-mail that tell our advertising service providers the Internet address of the Site pages viewed by users, browsing patterns within the Site, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the Site.
==========
Behavioral Information/Targeted Marketing
We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you while you are on Seagate websites.
These advertising service providers may use anonymous behavioral information, such as how you navigate the website, to provide relevant advertisements to you while you are on Seagate websites.
These advertising service providers do not have access to or collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, account number or telephone number.
If you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some inconvenience in your use of Seagate websites, as described above.
Advertising on Other Websites
Seagate contracts with advertising companies to advertise our accounts and services on websites not affiliated with Seagate.
If you click on one of our ads, you link to the Seagate website that offers the advertised account or service.
==========
These ads may contain cookies that allow tracking of your response to our advertisements.
These cookies do not identify you personally.
Seagate's advertising service providers, such as Google, Yahoo!, or MSN/Microsoft, may offer a way to opt-out of targeted advertising based on the use of their cookies.
In addition, if you prefer that our advertising service providers not know which Seagate website pages you have viewed visit the  Network Advertising Initiative site to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies.
In order for the opt-outs to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies.
==========
If you delete cookies, buy a new computer, access Seagate websites from a different computer, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again.
If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as behavioral marketing technology does not work when scripting is disabled.
Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.
Alternatively, if you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some inconvenience in your use of Seagate websites.
==========
Children Under 13
This Site is not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.
If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
==========
Keeping Your Information Secure
We have reasonable and appropriate security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.
If you have registered on this Site or are a member of the Seagate Partner Program, access to your account will be protected by your password.
We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.
==========
Additional Information Regarding Personal Servers
Our “personal server” feature enables you to share files from your storage device over the Internet only with people you authorize.
Authorized users have access only to those files you specifically designate.
No one can access your files over the Internet without your permission.
==========
You connect with our servers during sign-in.
After you have successfully signed in, you can view and download files that you have enabled for web access or that have been shared with you by other personal server owners.
We give you the option of creating private, password-protected folders and files on your personal server.
Except as stated below, your files are stored only on your personal server, not on our servers, and only you and the people with whom you choose to share your files ever see your data.
Keep in mind that any files or pictures you share using the personal server can be saved and forwarded by the people with whom you share them.
We do not keep records of your files on our servers nor do we track the sharing activity of your files.
==========
We store the file directory of your personal server on our servers.
You use this directory to navigate and select the files you want to view or download when you are away from your personal server.
When you download a file from the Web Service, you are pulling the file directly from your personal server, not from our servers.
We also store some directory names (but not file names) in our secure data center in order to provide persistent share information and descriptions to your recipients.
The personal server service automatically times out signed-in users after a period of inactivity.
==========
If we suspect that your account has been compromised or is being used suspiciously, we will deactivate the account and notify you.
Notify us immediately by sending an e-mail to webmaster@seagate.com if you think your account has been compromised.
All data transmissions between your personal server and your authorized web users are protected by 128-bit SSL encryption.
Our service hardware is housed in a secure, access-controlled data center where each access is logged.
Only authorized employees with a need for access are granted access.
==========
Other Sites
This Site may contain links to other websites that we do not control or maintain.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by these other websites.
We encourage you to note when you leave this Site and to read the privacy statements of such other websites before submitting any personally identifiable information.
==========
International Processing and Transfer of Data
Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission and processing of data on an international basis (including in and to the United States and countries other than the country where the data was collected from you, which may not have data protection laws as stringent as those that exist in your country of residence).
By using this Site, or providing personal information to Seagate you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories outside of the country where the data was collected from you.
Contact Information

==========
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy if we materially change our practices or if legal or regulatory changes require it.
If we decide to use or disclose personal information in a way that is materially different from that which was stated in this Privacy Policy at the time the personal information was collected, we will notify you by posting notice of the change on our Site's home page for at least 30 days before we implement that change and will give you an opportunity to opt-out of the proposed use or disclosure of previously collected personal information.
You should refer to this policy often for the latest information and the effective date of any changes.
