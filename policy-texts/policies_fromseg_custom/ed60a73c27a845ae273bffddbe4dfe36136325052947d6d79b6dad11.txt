WebEx respects your privacy.
When using our sites, you may get information, access online products and services, communicate with us or link to other web sites with which we do business.
While doing that, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our website.
This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Personally Identifiable Information that you share with us ("PII”).
==========
The following principles govern web-sites owned and operated by WebEx.
These principles do not govern web-sites of other parties to which we may provide only links because WebEx is not responsible, and can not control the privacy practices or content of those sites.
WebEx collects PII when you register for a WebEx account or use the WebEx products or services for the following purposes:
To deliver the products and services you or your company have ordered for your use from WebEx.
To maintain accounting and billing contact information and other financial records.
==========
To customize the advertising and content you see.
To contact you regarding our services unless you elected not to receive these communications.
When you register with WebEx, we ask for your name, email address, physical address, telephone numbers and, in some cases credit card information when you order services on-line.
Some of our customers use WebEx services to provide sessions, such as web seminars, which require the participants to register prior to attending the session.
When you register for one of these sessions, you may be asked to provide additional information such as your birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.
This information is provided to the customer hosting the session.
==========
WebEx may store this information on behalf of our customers as necessary to fulfill our obligations to our customers.
WebEx requires that all such customers use, hold and process such PII in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
WebEx also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, WebEx cookie information and the page you requested.
WebEx routinely collects information that cannot be identified to a particular individual such as time-stamps and logs events (like features used, number of participants, length of meetings.)
This data is used for accounting/billing purposes as well as for performance and optimization of the WebEx services.
==========
If we change any of our privacy policies or practices, we'll post those changes to this policy statement at least 30 days before they take effect.
In limited cases, we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.

WebEx will send PII about you to other companies or people only when:
We have your consent to share the information;
We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;
We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of WebEx to provide a WebEx product or service or to otherwise assist WebEx with its business activities.
(Unless we tell you otherwise, these companies do not have any right to use the PII we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us and are required to safeguard PII and not to disclose PII to others)
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or
We find that your actions on our Web sites violate the WebEx Terms of Service.

==========
To request such account maintenance send your email request to privacy@webex.com.
You may also indicate that you do not wish to receive messages from WebEx regarding our services or update your information relating to such messages at unsubscribe@webex.com.
Following your request for either type of data editing, your information will be changed in WebEx’s data bases after we receive the information necessary to process your request.
==========
The WebEx switching environment is designed similarly to the telephone switching environment.
Once the meeting is over the content of the meeting is not retained by WebEx unless the customer specifically requests that the content be recorded.
WebEx uses industry standard encryption as well as its own proprietary technology to protect PII and meeting content.
Further, the only means to participate in a meeting is through the WebEx invitation and join meeting process, which should include a password for each meeting.
WebEx strongly recommends that all meetings be protected by passwords.
In addition, the host has full control over attendee presence and may eject unwanted participants or lock a meeting to prevent additional participants.
