Some of these Ask Apps Products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on the stores' requirements.
For certain Ask Apps Products, the search features (and other features such as maps, local radio and document management), may be customized by you on your device.
In addition, you may be able to disable or remove the default search features by removing or disabling the applicable extension you downloaded or changing your default search within your browser.
This will depend on your browser and its relevant features.

P. INFORMATION FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information.
The CCPA Notice applies to “Consumers” as defined by the law.
This section describes your CCPA rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights.
==========

The categories of your personal information we have sold.
The categories of third parties to which we sold personal information, by categories of personal information sold for each third party.
==========
You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your personal information that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.

Exercising Your Rights
To make a request for access, portability or deletion according to your rights under CCPA, click here or mail your request for the attention of the Privacy / Legal Department to Ask Applications, Inc. 29 Wells Avenue, Suite 300, Yonkers, NY 10701.
==========
California Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.
Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”).
==========
The Verifiable Consumer Request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).
As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests.
If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.
We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
==========
We do not “sell” personal information that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of “sell” in the CCPA and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a do not sell request.
There is not yet a consensus as to whether third-party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites may constitute a “sale” of your personal information as defined by the CCPA.
You can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser.
We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.
==========
However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
