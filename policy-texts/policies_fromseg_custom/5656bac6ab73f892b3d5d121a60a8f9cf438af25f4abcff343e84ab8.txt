Our Privacy Vow
Our goal at Lycos is to be "Your Personal Internet Guide" by providing you with the information and services that are most relevant to you.
==========
To achieve this goal, we need to collect information to understand what differentiates you from each of our millions of other unique users.
We collect this information in two ways.
Registration
First, you may provide us with certain information such as your name, e-mail address and postal addresses when registering for certain services such as My Lycos, Chat, E-mail, and contests/promotions.
This information is used for purposes such as personalization and verification.
==========
Cookies
Cookies Second, we may track your visit to our site by giving you a "cookie" when you enter.
Cookies are pieces of information that Web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Lycos uses cookies to make visiting our site and our partner sites, such as PlanetAll, easier.
Cookies allow us to savepasswords and preferences for you so that you won't have to re-enter them the next time you visit.
For example, when you register with My Lycos, you will be automatically registered with PlanetAll as well, and retain the same username and password for both sites.
Cookies also help us track user trends and patterns.
Cookies also help us collect anonymous click stream data for tracking user trends and patterns.
==========
In addition, third party advertising networks that Lycos uses may issue cookies when serving advertisements.
Engage Technologies may use anonymous clickstream to target relevant advertising to you.
To opt out of Engage's use of such information, go to www.engage.com.
==========
Lycos recently contracted with DoubleClick to provide banner and other advertising campaigns across the Lycos Network.
When DoubleClick is serving ads to you, it does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address.
However, to enable DoubleClick to compile meaningful reports for the Lycos Network and its advertisers and to better target advertising to you, DoubleClick collects the following types of non-personally-identifiable information about users who are served ads via DoubleClick technology:
Your IP address (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet), from which DoubleClick can infer a user�s geographic location, company, and type and size of organization.
Your domain type (i.e., .
==========
com, .
net, or .
edu.)
.
==========
Standard information included with every communication sent on the Internet.
Information which DoubleClick can infer from this standard information includes your browser version and type (i.e., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (i.e., windows or DOS), browser language (i.e., Java or Unix), service provider (i.e., MindSpring or AOL), your local time, etc.
How you utilize the pages you visit within a DoubleClick client's site (e.g. which pages you view).
Keyword search terms (e.g. if you do a search on "homes," you may be shown advertisements for mortgage companies).
==========
In addition, DoubleClick combines the non-personally-identifiable information it collects from the user�s computer with the log-in name and demographic data about users collected by Lycos Network properties and furnished to DoubleClick for the sole purpose of ad targeting on the Lycos Network.
The benefit of this is that you may receive ads that more closely match your interests.
This information is afforded the same stringent privacy protections as other Lycos-collected personally-identifiable and DoubleClick-collected non-personally-identifiable data.
==========
Lycos and DoubleClick believe that the use of the non-personally-identifiable data benefits you because it eliminates needless repetition of advertisements and enhances the functionality and effectiveness of the advertisements you view which are delivered through the DoubleClick technology.
DoubleClick uses "cookies" to better understand your web surfing behavior, and, thereby, to enhance your web viewing experience.
DoubleClick�s cookies are small amounts of data that it stores a user�s computer on a temporary or more permanent basis.
==========
The cookies do not damage your system or files in any way.
It works like this: When you are first served an ad by DoubleClick, DoubleClick assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer.
Then, when you visit a web site on which DoubleClick serves ads, DoubleClick reads this number to help target ads to you.
==========
The cookie can help ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over again.
Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site.
This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs.
Although Lycos users cannot opt-out of the advertising process, DoubleClick offers you the ability to control the data collection and targeting process by using a "blank" or "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being associated with your browser or you individually.
By denying DoubleClick�s cookies, ads delivered to you by Doubleclick can only be targeted based on the non-personally identifiable information that is available from the Internet environment, such as browser type and Internet service provider.
Your opt-out will be effective for the entire life of your browser or until you delete the cookie file on your hard drive.
To learn more about how to opt-out, please click here.
==========
If you have any additional questions about the way DoubleClick collects information, please contact the company via the mail at DoubleClick, 450 West 33rd Street, New York, NY 10001, by email at info@doubleclick.net or by telephone at 212-271-2542.
The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you'll find them used on most major Web sites.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies.
You should understand that areas of certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.
==========
Use of Information
Any personal information you provide to The Lycos Network when registering for services, such as MyLycos, at any of its network sites is maintained and accessible only by the Lycos Network unless specifically stated otherwise.
Our primary goal in requesting this information is to provide its registered users with customized experiences across our network.
This includes personalization services, interactive communications, games, online shopping and many other types of content and services.
Most of these offerings are completely free to you.
In order to provide such great content and services free of charge, we display advertisements.
==========
It�s simple really.
The better we are able to provide venues for our sponsors and other advertising partners to reach specific demographic segments of our user base, the more advertising revenue we earn.
The more revenue we earn, the better we are able to provide you with new and exciting content and services.
With more content and services we will attract more users.
More users means more venues for advertising.
And so on.
==========
Thus, by knowing a little about you, the Lycos Network is able to deliver more relevant advertisements, services and content to its users.
The Lycos Network may use the personally identifiable information it collects in accordance with the following descriptions:
The Lycos Network offers its users the ability to personalize content on the Network, such as news, stock portfolios, weather reports, sports scores, movie and television listings, horoscopes and more.
We use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors as to numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement(s).
We will also disclose to those third-party sponsors the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement.
No personally identifiable information will be disclosed to these advertisers as part of this process; only information in an aggregate form.
==========
In general, advertisers do not want to know about you specifically.
What advertisers want is the chance to appeal to large groups of users who share certain demographic characteristics, such as gender and age.
The Lycos Network gives advertisers this opportunity.
==========
If we did not collect this data, we would not be able to provide the most effective forum for our sponsors to advertise in, nor would we be able to measure which promotions work.
Without providing this benefit to our advertisers, we would be unable to keep the Lycos Network free for all to use.
We also use the aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Lycos Network and to analyze how and where best to use our resources.
Without such data, we would not know what the most popular areas of the Lycos Network are, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately.
The Lycos Network may, from time to time, use your information to contact you about changes or enhancements to Lycos Network content and services.
In addition, if you told the Lycos Network that you were interested in receiving offers or information from selected Lycos Network sponsors and partners, we will send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you.
==========
For those who elect to receive such materials from the Lycos Network or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their profile, we do release personally identifiable information.
Information released includes: real name, street address, e-mail address, interests, and the broader personal information (e.g., level of education, occupation and marital status) supplied in registrations on the Lycos Network.
The Lycos Network limits the sending of third-party or purely promotional/advertising e-mail solicitations to users who have elected to receive this type of information/communication as described above.
Such solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, must clearly indicate who the originator of the e-mail is, and provide the member with a method of opting out from receiving future communications.
Only the Lycos Network will send you these direct mailings.
==========
It is our policy not to send messages to users who have asked told us they are not interested in receiving such messages, either when they registered or subsequently when they edited their user profile.
The Lycos Network sometimes uses an individual registered user�s data to "pre-populate" forms which are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by the Lycos Network and/or its sponsors.
(For example, a magazine which advertises on Lycos Gamesville may want Lycos Gamesville members to subscribe to the magazine, so they display a request subscription form as an advertisement.
As part of the advertisement, the Lycos Gamesville will pre-populate, or pre-fill-in the form with the individual registered user�s profile data.
However, in no case does pre-populating a form transfer any data to any advertiser or third party.
Only if the registered user voluntarily requests that such data be transferred does any transfer take place -- for example, if/when a member' clicks a "submit form" or other button.
If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest on the Lycos Network, we will use the information you provided to contact you in the event you win.
==========
We respond to subpoenas, warrants, or other court orders regarding information that is contained within our access logs concerning any member or visitor.
We also reserve the right to release that information concerning a user who we believe is in violation of the Lycos Network Terms and Conditions or other published guidelines and Official Rules, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order.
We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our servers for illegal activities.
We also reserve the right to report any illegal activity to law enforcement for prosecution.
The Lycos Network also cooperates with, and reserves the right to release any and all information to, tax collection and tax law enforcement agencies in order to identify those users who may owe taxes on earnings from the Lycos Network, for example from Lycos Gamesville prize winnings (U.S. residents who win $600.00 or more combined cash and merchandise prizes in a calendar year must provide their Social Security number in order to receive "1099" forms from Lycos Gamesville).
With whom the Lycos Network shares the information that is collected
In order to provide you with content and services that match your interests, the Lycos Network has relationships with many of the best services and content companies.
==========
Many of these services also require registration to make them function properly.
You can recognize most of these sites by the joint branding of Lycos and such companies.
For example, if you see a logo in the upper-right corner of the page that says 'Powered by ______', you are on a co-branded site.
Information will be shared with Lotus Notes when registering for My Lycos through this cobrand.
Lycos attaches a special partner code to these users to ensure that only those users receive information about Lotus Notes products and services.
Other third party relationships are "private label" relationships by which the partner is providing technology, services and/or content under Lycos Network branding.
Whenever you provide registration information on co-branded sites, that data may be shared with our partners.
You should make every effort to read the individual privacy policies of the partners, and make an informed decision on your own whether or not to continue based upon these sites' privacy practices and your own discretion.
You may opt-out of sharing your information with such partners by choosing not to use that service or content.
==========
The following is a non-exhaustive list of third-parties with whom Lycos has contracted to provide you services and content:
Lycos Free Internet Access
Lycos has partnered with 1stUp, Inc. ("1stUp") to be the technology provider for Lycos Free Internet Access Service.
By contract, 1stUp will collect certain demographic and psychographic data about users of the service.
1stUp may only use the data it collects in aggregate form for marketing purposes and only in ways consistent with this and 1stUp�s privacy policy.
==========
This information shall be jointly owned by Lycos and 1stUp.
The Lycos Network will not share any Personally Identifiable Information with 1stUp as a result of the registration process.
For more information about 1stUp�s privacy policy, click here.
==========
Lycos Auctions and Classifieds
Lycos partners with FairMarket, Inc. ("FairMarket"), to provide auction and classified services for the Lycos Network.
The FairMarket Network is a collection of FairMarket-powered, private-label merchant, portal and online community auction sites connected through a shared database of goods and services.
When you register for Lycos Auctions, that information resides in database hosted by Fair Market and FairMarket has the right to use such registration data solely in connection with developing and hosting Auction Services for Lycos and for no other purpose.
Registration data from the use of the auction services relating to users registered with Lycos shall be owned exclusively by Lycos to be used in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
For more information about FairMarket�s privacy policy click here.
==========
Online Invitations
Lycos partners with Mambo.com ("Mambo") to provide users with online invitation services.
Mambo shall manage the user database on the co-branded service, which shall include, without limitation, any and all information provided by the users on the co-branded invitation service.
Lycos and Mambo shall jointly own all User Information obtained on the site.
Neither party may sell or otherwise transfer User information to a third party without the user�s permission.
