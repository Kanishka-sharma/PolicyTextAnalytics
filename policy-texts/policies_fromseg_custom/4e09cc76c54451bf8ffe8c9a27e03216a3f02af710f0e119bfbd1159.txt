As part of our mission of helping make commerce better for everyone, Shopify Inc. and its affiliates, including Shopify Data Processing (USA) Inc., Shopify Payments (USA) Inc., Shopify (USA) Inc., and Shopify International Limited (collectively, “Shopify”) collect and process a lot of information.
This Privacy Policy is intended to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your personal information—whether you are a merchant or end user that uses Shopify’s products, applications or services (together, the “Services”), a customer that shops at a store using our technology, a participant in Shopify’s “Partners” program, or whether you’re simply visiting this website.
By using any of Shopify’s Services, or by dealing with a merchant using Shopify’s Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Shopify Terms of Service.
==========
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our privacy practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this Website, and where appropriate, by other means.
By continuing to use this Website or the Support Service after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
