We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes, and we will use it only for those purposes.
We will obtain your consent if we wish to use your information for any other purpose and before collecting information from third parties such as credit bureaus.
2.
==========
Releasing Information
We may provide your information to other persons, but only:
where we have your consent
to our suppliers or agents who assist us in serving you
where we are required or permitted to do so by law

We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We will retain your information only for the time it is required for the purposes we explain.

In this Privacy Code site we will explain how we fulfil each of these important principles.
==========
Why We Ask For Your Information
We ask you for information to establish and serve you as our customer.
We obtain most of our information about you directly from you.
The information we ask for depends on which product or service you want.
For every product or service, we need your name, address and some identification.
Here is why we need some of the other information we ask you to provide.
==========
•Birth date
This helps us identify you and ensure that no one is trying to impersonate you.
We may also use it to determine your eligibility for products and services that may be of benefit to a particular age group.
•Social Insurance Number (SIN)
Your SIN is required for products which earn investment income, in order to comply with Revenue Canada's income reporting requirements.
Providing your SIN for credit products is optional.
If you provide your SIN, we also use it to keep your information separate from that of other customers with a similar name, including information we obtain with your consent through the credit approval process.
•Financial information
This is used to assess your eligibility for any credit product, for example, a TD Visa* card, line of credit or other loan.
We also use it to ensure that the advice we give you or the investments you purchase (in the case of mutual funds or brokerage or investment accounts) are appropriate for you.
•Health information
This is required for some insurance products to ensure you are eligible for coverage.
==========
We only collect the information we need and only use it for the purposes explained to you.
When you apply for a new product or service, we will indicate in the application or agreement how we intend to use your information.
If we wish in the future to use it for another purpose, we will ask you for your consent at that time.
We will only ask for the information we need for that particular product or service.
==========
We will indicate clearly which information would help us to serve you but is optional for you to provide.
Serving You Better
With your consent, we may share your information within the TD Bank Financial Group.
This will help us serve you better and determine whether any products or services of the TD Bank Financial Group are suitable for you so that we can offer them to you.
We want to serve you better and meet your customer service expectations.
==========
Agreeing to let us share your information within the TD Bank Financial Group helps us to meet this goal.
It lets us instantly recognize your total relationship with the TD Bank Financial Group, no matter when or where you contact us or which one of us you contact.
It also means that changes to your information, such as updated addresses or telephone numbers, can be made once and be effective for all your products or services with the TD Bank Financial Group.
Sharing your information also helps us determine your financial needs because it allows us to review what products of the TD Bank Financial Group you have and how you use them.
We may then offer you other products and services of the TD Bank Financial Group - including special promotions - that we believe will be of interest to you.
Please note that health information that may have been provided in connection with an insurance product is never shared.
==========
This consent is optional and you can decide to withdraw it at any time.
Please refer to the Recording Your Options section on this site.
Why We Ask Others For Information About You
With your consent, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including through a credit check.
Obtaining additional information about you from parties outside the TD Bank Financial Group helps us assess your eligibility for our products.
==========
For credit products, for example, we need to know your creditworthiness.
For this reason, we may contact other lenders or credit bureaus to give us information on your credit history.
We may also contact employers or other personal references to verify information that you have given us.
We will not do this without your consent, but please remember that if you do not give your consent we may not be able to extend credit services to you.
When We Release Your Information
Under no circumstances do we sell customer lists or information to others.
We release your information to parties outside the TD Bank Financial Group only under the following circumstances.
==========
•With your consent
We will disclose your credit history with us to other lenders or credit bureaus in order to support the credit approval process.
We release only the information required to identify you, as well as facts from our credit records about your repayment history.
•For servicing purposes
We give a limited amount of information, only as necessary, without your consent to our suppliers and agents; for example, cheque printers and bank card manufacturers who provide goods and services to you through us.
•When required or permitted by law
When required or permitted by law We must give information in response to a valid demand, search warrant or other legally valid enquiry or order.
We may disclose information to help us collect a debt owed to us by you.
We may also disclose information to an investigative body in the case of a breach of agreement or contravention of law – this helps prevent fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity.
==========
How We Protect Your Information
We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We have thorough security standards to protect our systems and your information against unauthorized access and use.
For example, our systems have been designed to ensure that your Personal Identification Number (PIN), password and other access codes are always private and confidential.
When you use your PIN at an automated banking machine, it is scrambled after you enter it.
For your protection, your access codes are known only to you - our employees cannot gain access to them and they will not ask you to reveal them.
==========
All our suppliers and agents, as part of their contracts with the TD Bank Financial Group, are bound to maintain your confidentiality and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose.
When we provide information in response to a legal enquiry or order, we ensure that the order is valid and we disclose only the information that is legally required.
All employees of the TD Bank Financial Group are familiar with the procedures that must be taken to safeguard customer information.
And to us, protecting the confidentiality of your information is more than a procedure - it's part of our jobs.
It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.
We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure that they are being properly administered and that they remain effective and appropriate.
==========
We retain your information only as long as it is required for the reasons it was collected.
The length of time we retain information varies depending on the product or service and the nature of the information.
This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us but only for so long as it is legally necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issue that may arise at a later date.
==========
When your information is no longer needed for the purposes explained to you, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form.
Your Right To Access Your Information
We will give you access to the information we have about you.
Most of this information is in the form of your transaction records.
==========
These are available to you through your account statements or passbook updates, by visiting the branch or office where your account is held, or by accessing your account through our web or telephone banking and brokerage services.
If you require other information, simply contact the branch or office where your account is maintained.
We will ask you for specific details such as branch and account number.
We will advise you in advance if a minimal charge will be required for conducting the search, and we will respond to your request within 30 days.
==========
Please note that we may not be able to provide information about you from our records which contains references to other persons which is subject to legal privilege, contains confidential information proprietary to the TD Bank Financial Group, relates to an investigation of a breach of agreement or contravention of laws, or cannot be disclosed for other legal reasons.
Also, we do not maintain disclosure records for regular or routine actions such as T5 or other reports to Revenue Canada, regular updating of credit information to credit bureaus, or account balance deficiencies through the return of NSF items.
If you have any questions regarding decisions made about you, we will tell you the reasons for those decisions.
Where relevant, we will provide you with the name and address of the credit bureau from which a report was obtained.
==========
Keeping Your Information Accurate
We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.
Having accurate information about you enables us to give you the best possible service.
Allowing us to share your information within the TD Bank Financial Group means updates to your information can be made once and be effective for all the products and services you have with the TD Bank Financial Group.
You can help by keeping us informed of any changes such as if you move or change telephone numbers.
If you find any errors in our information about you, let us know and we will make the corrections immediately and make sure they are conveyed to anyone we may have misinformed.
For information that remains in dispute, we will note your opinion in the file.
==========
Recording Your Options
We will explain your options of refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use or release of your information, and we will record and respect your choices.
In most cases you are free to refuse or withdraw your consent at any time.
You may do so by contacting the branch or office where your account is held or by calling1-866-567-8888.
Our staff will be pleased to explain your options and any consequences of refusing or withdrawing your consent, and record your options.
==========
If you don't want us to share information within the TD Bank Financial Group or contact you with product information, you can tell us so at any time.
You can choose, for instance, not to receive centralized direct mail or telephone marketing, or to receive information only for certain products.
Our staff will guide you through the numerous choices.
You will continue to receive product brochures and messages included in account statements.
==========
You can change your options at any time.
You may refuse consent for us to do a credit check, but we may not be able to extend credit services to you.
Once you have a credit product, you may not withdraw your consent to share your credit experience with other lenders and credit bureaus, as this is necessary to support the credit approval process.
==========

Session cookies store information only for the length of time that you are connected to a website - they are not written onto your hard drive.
Once you leave the Web site, the originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on it.
==========
TD Bank Financial Group uses session cookies as an additional security feature for its Web online services.
For example, when you login to any Web service and are authenticated through your login ID and password, a cookie will store the identification number of your browser.
Throughout your session, the session cookie acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session to the Web Server.
The Web Server will monitor the number of your browser to ensure that, at all times during your session, we are dealing with you.
We also use session cookies to track your visits within our site.
We use that information to determine the type of information that you are looking for in our site and to improve our site.
We use information about the site you visited immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to our site that we have created on third party sites.
The information stored in “persistent cookies” is written onto your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie.

==========
For example, if you choose the option on our login screen to remember your Connect ID for Web Banking or WebBroker, the system will remember and automatically input your logon id each time you use the service.
Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies and persistent cookies.
For Web services to operate, your browser must be set to accept cookies.
If you are concerned about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are surfing other Web sites, we recommend that you enable your browser to notify you when it is receiving a cookie.
