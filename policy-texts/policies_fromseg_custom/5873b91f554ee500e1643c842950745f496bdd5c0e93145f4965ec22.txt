LiveJasmin Site
What is LiveJasmin?
LiveJasmin is an adult live video chat site, where you can chat with amateur Performers from all over the world.
These Performers broadcast video image live from their homes or studios, so you can watch them while chatting.
LiveJasmin offers a wide variety of models; to pick the one who fits your desire, you can use our Advanced Search that will help you find Performers based on appearance, age, spoken language, specialties, video quality and many more.

Are all cameras live?
Yes!
On LiveJasmin all online Performers provide a live camera feed in their chatrooms.

On the other hand, we also offer a great deal of pre-recorded VideoOnDemand streams for a rather moderate price.
These videos are listed in a separate section of the site.

How does video chat work?
The Performer has a webcam or camcorder set up in front of her providing live video feed through the Internet.
Many Performers have audio option, so not only you can see them but hear them at the same time.

Q - When I've given my credit-card information to similar sites in the past, they abused it.
==========
How do I know I can trust You?
A - LiveJasmin is one of the fastest-growing web-conferencing and videochat services on the internet.
==========
We have millions of registered users and over 153100 registered video chathosts, both numbers growing every day, and with participation from more than 50 different countries.
No company online or offline could ever hope to achieve that degree of success by engaging in abusive practices or by taking advantage of its customers.
==========
At LiveJasmin, the Customer is King.
You are king.
We are extremely proud of our record for excellence in customer service.
==========
Q - How do I know my personal information is safe on Your servers?
What about hackers?
A - Your registration information is always safe from hackers.
All elements of the registration form (including this very message) are SSL-encrypted via Verisign digital certificates for Your complete and total safety (look for the "closed padlock" icon when using Internet Explorer/AOL/Netscape or similar browsers).
Since the beginning of our operation, 2001, our encrypted and firewall-protected systems have never suffered even a single serious security breach.
==========
Q - If I fill out the form, am I going to get slammed with junk e-mail from 3rd parties?
A - Perhaps with other internet services, but never with LiveJasmin.
LiveJasmin never shares or sells your registration information, including your e-mail address, with outside parties.
Of course, if You contact any of LiveJasmin's 153100 videochat hosts and exchange your contact information with a chathost, we can't prevent that chathost from sending You e-mail, but that is your decision -- LiveJasmin never makes that decision for You.

LiveJasmin is a "Scam-Free Zone".
What's that?
==========
If You've spent much time surfing the web, especially those sites that offer adult-oriented areas, You've learned (probably the hard way) not to give Your credit-card number or other financial information to a website unless You're positive Your personal and financial information won't be misused or abused by hackers or by anyone else (including the site itself).
First, on LiveJasmin, your membership information is always safe from hackers.
==========
All elements of the registration form are SSL-encrypted via Verisign digital certificates for your complete and total safety (look for the "closed padlock" icon when using Internet Explorer/AOL/Netscape or similar browsers).
Moreover, ever since our first day of operation on the internet (we've been online since the earliest days of the web), our encrypted and firewall-protected systems have never suffered even a single serious security incident.
==========
Second, at LiveJasmin, any personal information collected from You is kept strictly confidential and is for the limited purpose of identity verification to protect LiveJasmin from abusive behavior.
(E-commerce-enabled Chat services occasionally attract user misconduct such as identity theft, spam and other abuses.)
LiveJasmin undertakes responsible measures to verify your identity, including matching your registration information against available verification databases and services.
==========
Of course, your privacy is respected and protected at all times).
Any payment information collected will never be used to charge You for anything, unless You specifically authorize us to.
You'll never be burned by LiveJasmin.
Ever.
==========
Other sites bury the fees and terms in the fine print (and some don't even care to mention them).
But our plain-English Terms of Service explains in the first paragraph how it all works.

How LiveJasmin Protects Your Privacy?
- We NEVER sell, rent or share Your personal information or e-mail address with any other party!
- We may send You occasional promotional e-mails, and every e-mail will contain an unsubscribe option.
==========
- Your personal information is NEVER stored on LiveJasmin.com's server, so it cannot be stolen by hackers.
Not only we do respect Your privacy, we protect Your privacy!!!
LiveJasmin is occasionally contacted by third parties who, for marketing purposes, want to purchase our mailing list and other sensitive customer information derived from our database.
Although there is no law forbidding LiveJasmin from selling such information, the trading of which is an extremely lucrative business, LiveJasmin is serious in its commitment to protecting your personal privacy.
We have never sold such personal information about our customers to outside parties -- not even once -- and we never will.
As a general rule, LiveJasmin collects only three kinds of information about you:
1.
Information that You voluntarily provide to us or authorize us to view, such as your name, address, credit-card and other account information as submitted on the LiveJasmin Membership Submission Form.
2.
"Log information" about the areas of LiveJasmin that You visit, that are accessible from the general internet environment.
3.
==========
Private correspondence, such as the contents of telephone conversations, chat client logs, faxes or letters to LiveJasmin staff, e-mail messages to performers or LiveJasmin staff, performer chat client logs.
Log information bears greater explanation:
Log information typically consists of such things as your browser type (i.e., Netscape or MSIE), your IP address (i.e., 102.316.52.11), the domain name from which You are visiting LiveJasmin (i.e., "aol.com"), and the pages of LiveJasmin that You visit.
==========
Like all internet services, we analyze our log files to better understand which areas of LiveJasmin are more popular than others.
And like most other large-scale internet properties, we also use this information to "customize" the LiveJasmin experience to match your tastes.
==========
For example, if You first visit LiveJasmin by searching an internet portal for a search term such as "voyeur" and clicking upon an LiveJasmin banner or link, LiveJasmin may set a "cookie" on your computer which records the term as a "search preference" (Note: Everyday log-analysis programs such as WebTrends include such tracking of keyword-specific traffic as a regular feature - indeed, using such tools, the administrators of most websites on earth track traffic originating from search engines by searched keyword).
Later, as You navigate through LiveJasmin, You will likely observe that the content You see on LiveJasmin tends to be tailored to match your recorded search preference.
Note: such cookies are "secure" in that they cannot be read by other internet companies, but can only be read by the web site which placed the cookie on Your computer.
==========
LiveJasmin also uses your recorded "search preference" information to better target and allocate marketing expenditures.
For example, if LiveJasmin learns that, in aggregate, individuals who search portals for terms such as "voyeur" are more likely to purchase goods and services from LiveJasmin than individuals who search for terms such as "livecams", LiveJasmin may allocate greater portions of its marketing budget to targeting the former group, and a smaller portion of its budget to target the latter group.
By optimizing marketing strategies in this manner, LiveJasmin has more disposable capital that can be deployed toward development efforts which improve the LiveJasmin platform and provide a richer customer experience for all.
==========
Speaking of cookies, another kind of cookie that LiveJasmin sets is an "identification cookie".
This cookie is written whenever You successfully use your login and password to access a restricted area of LiveJasmin; the identification cookie is available only to individuals who have already been verified as adults, via LiveJasmin's verification procedures.
When LiveJasmin's servers observe this identification cookie on your computer, they recognize You and therefore might deliver unmodified content as opposed to modified content - in effect, another form of customized content tailored to suit your indicated preferences.
==========
Another question that might concern you: "Does LiveJasmin outsource to other companies any privacy-sensitive functions such as management of its e-mail newsletter system, web hosting, or its e-commerce platform?"
Because LiveJasmin is committed to safeguarding the integrity of your personal information, we have elected to not use such services, despite the fact that they are reasonably-priced and simplify the management task of running a large and complex website operation.
