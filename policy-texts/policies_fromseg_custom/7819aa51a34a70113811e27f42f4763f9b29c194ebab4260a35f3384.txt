During the registration process, we ask registrants to provide name, email address, and other information as listed below for notification and security purposes.
We may also ask for birth dates to validate ages.
We only collect the information that is reasonably necessary for a child to participate in an online activity.
We will also collect a parent’s email address, because portions of our site may be deemed to be child-targeted under the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
We will ask for the parent’s email address before collecting name or email address or other identifying information from a site visitor who has self-identified as under 13 years of age.
We will not use parent emails provided for these registration purposes to market to the parent, unless a parent expressly opts in to such messages or separately has registered.
We will send an email address to the parent to explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how the parent can provide or revoke consent.
If we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable period of time, then we will delete the parent contact information and any other information collected from the child in connection with the activity.

Push Notifications
        Push notifications are notifications on devices such as smartphones or tablets that run our Brainly app.
These can communicate to the device holder even when the application is not in use.
We will require a child to provide a parent email address before the child can receive push notifications, because such technology requires that we collect and use a unique device identifier from the mobile device.
We will then provide the parent with notice of our contact with the child and will provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications.
We will not associate the device identifier with other personal information without contacting the parent to get consent.
