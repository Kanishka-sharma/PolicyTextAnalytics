Privacy Policy
Effective Date: February 22, 2011
Esri values the privacy of those who visit our websites and register for our software and services online.
We think it is important for you to understand when and why we collect personally identifiable information and how we may use it.
This Privacy Policy describes Esri data collection and use policies.
Please read the entire Privacy Policy before providing any personally identifiable information to us.
Notice
Esri collects personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, only if you provide this information to us voluntarily.
The voluntary information we collect is used to complete transactions; ensure appropriate legal use of licensed Esri software; provide notification to licensees about updates to Esri's and our affiliates' software, data, and services; and help provide technical and product support to our users.
Where appropriate, Esri may pass this data to an Esri international distributor that provides the above services in your country, or to an Esri affiliate or vendor whose software, data, and services are used to meet your needs or process transactions.
Our affiliates and vendors are also committed to protecting personally identifiable information as described in their privacy statements/policies.
Esri may also use your name, address, and e-mail to send you marketing materials, User Conference information, and newsletters unless you notify us that you do not want to receive these materials.
==========
Occasionally, Esri uses the services of bonded mailing houses that are authorized to use your personally identifiable data only for the benefit of Esri and its affiliates.
While browsing the Esri website, you may be able to access the websites of our affiliates and third parties through a hyperlink.
Esri assumes no responsibility for the privacy practices of third parties' websites and suggests you review the privacy statements/policies on such websites before sharing your personally identifiable data.
Collection
Certain information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, may be stored through the use of "cookies" intended to speed access to Esri information and services.
A cookie is a small file that can be used to tell us when you visit our websites and track your browsing preferences.
Esri does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, telephone numbers, or other information you provide.
To maintain your privacy, you can disable your browser's ability to accept cookies.
Esri websites and software installation may require registration to gain access to special services, authorization codes, license keys, or other features.
==========
This information will be used to provide support and deliver specialized services.
Esri may also collect personally identifiable information you provide when you order and register software, data, or services; enter contests; order newsletters; register for training or conferences; or make requests that require a direct response to you.
Esri's website uses third-party web analytics services that collect and aggregate web surfing data.
==========
These services may record your mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, and any text you type in the website.
The services do not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in Esri's website and do not track your browsing habits across websites that do not use the services.
Choice
If you submit personal information, Esri may contact you or send you marketing information about software or services.
==========
If you do not wish to receive this information, you may notify us by sending an e-mail to info@esri.com as indicated below.
Keep in mind, however, that you may not receive information on the Esri International User Conference or other valuable information as a result of your election to be removed from mailing lists.
Other than as described in this Privacy Policy, Esri will not disclose or authorize others to disclose your personally identifiable information unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to legal requirements or prevent fraud or imminent harm, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Esri, or (3) as part of a transfer of assets to a successor in interest.
Except as stated, Esri does not rent, sell, or otherwise share personally identifiable information.
Access
Esri will permit you to access information about you in our database by contacting info@esri.com.
If you believe any of the information is incorrect or needs updating, please advise us.
We will correct our records upon verification of the requested change.
If you no longer wish to receive e-mail or postal notifications about software, services, or special promotions, please let us know by sending an e-mail to us at info@esri.com and specifying that you do not want to receive these notifications.
Please provide us with your exact name and address as well as a description of the publication or mail piece you received.
==========
We will use reasonable efforts to refrain from including you when sending marketing materials to Esri clients by noting your election in our database.
Security
Esri will take reasonable and prudent precautions to ensure that your personally identifiable data is protected against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
Enforcement
If you believe for any reason that Esri has not followed these principles, please contact us at info@esri.com, and Esri will act promptly to investigate, correct as appropriate, and advise you of the correction.
==========
Please identify the issue as a Privacy Policy concern in your communication to Esri.
