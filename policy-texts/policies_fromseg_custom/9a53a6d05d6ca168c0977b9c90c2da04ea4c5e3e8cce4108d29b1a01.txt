Our commitment to privacy
Welcome to AddThis, the #1 bookmarking and sharing button on the Internet.
AddThis ("AddThis", "we" or "our") has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of information about users of AddThis bookmarking, sharing button and other services that we may develop (collectively "Services").
This privacy policy applies to information that you provide to us when you use our Service on your website (an "AddThis Client") and also when you simply access our Services on a third party website, whether as a registered or non-registered user of our Services (an "AddThis Visitor").
Below we provide you with our privacy policy, where we intend to be transparent about any information we collect, how we intend to use the information, and what choices you have when you register with us and use our website or Services.
Our privacy policy in short:
Your privacy remains under your control
We will only use personal information you provide us according to the terms of this privacy policy
In order to use certain features of our platform, you will provide a limited amount of personal information
We will never disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party without your consent or unless we are required to so by law
You can cancel your AddThis account at any time
What information do we collect?
During use of our website and Services, we collect various types of data, usage statistics, demographic and preference information and other personal information as described below.
When registering on our website or using certain features of our Services, we may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you.
"Personally Identifiable Information" means information about you that may include, but is not limited to your username and email address.
AddThis Clients
In order to use certain Services on your website, we require AddThis Clients to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, including username, password and email address, when first becoming an AddThis Client.
We may also request additional Personally Identifiable Information from time to time thereafter.
==========
Providing such additional Personally Identifiable Information is entirely optional, although some of our Services may not function without such information.
For AddThis Clients, we use your Personally Identifiable Information mainly to provide the Services to you, as applicable, to track and provide analytics, and to administer your inquiries.
We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you with AddThis newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
AddThis Visitors
If you are simply using or accessing our website or Services as an AddThis Visitor, you may be required to register and/or to submit certain Personally Identifiable Information to us.
Registration information may include but is not limited to user name, password, email address, as well as any other information that you decide to provide us with.
In addition, if you use certain features of the Services, such as sharing content via our email feature, you will be required to include Personally Identifiable Information to us such as your email address and the email address of the person who is receiving the content.
In addition, we collect certain information which cannot be used to personally identify any user, and which may be provided to third parties.
==========
Such non-personal data ordinarily includes non-identifiable aggregate, summary, usage data, and other behavioral data and may include, by way of example, statistics regarding total users, information regarding types of Internet browsers used by users, and behavioral usage patterns.
We also collect non-personal data about each user's IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our website and Services.
Log Data
"Log Data" means information sent by your browser including, but not limited to your computer's IP address, referring HTTP address, current HTTP address, time of the access and other statistics.
When you visit our website or use our Services, our servers automatically record and collect Log Data sent by your browser.
We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze the use of our website and Services, for technical administration, to increase our website and Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our users needs.
==========
We also collect Log Data each time you visit third-party websites serving content that uses our Services.
We analyze Log Data from different websites and combine it with other non Personally Identifiable Information to produce reports and data that are made available on our website, to enable AddThis, web publishers and advertisers to deliver advertising and/or programming that are appropriate for their products or services.
This combined data is also used by us and our partners to serve you advertisements and other information tailored to your interests.
We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity.
==========
When an AddThis Visitor distributes content via our email functionality, we only retain email address information in our Log Data for up to ninety (90) days.
We make efforts to require our AddThis Clients to ensure that any such third party website post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights of their visitors.
Check the privacy policies of websites using our Services for information regarding the applicable privacy practices.
==========
Minors
Any AddThis Visitor providing personal data is certifying that he/she is over the age of 13.
As such, we do not collect or maintain personal data from individuals we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our website or Service is designed to attract people under 13.
Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.
Thus, if we ever obtain knowledge that that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's personal data from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the website and Services.
