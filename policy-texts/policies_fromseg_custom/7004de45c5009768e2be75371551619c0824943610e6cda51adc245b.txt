Cookies and Other Technologies


		2.1 What is a “Cookie”?
A cookie is a piece of information sent to your browser from a website
		and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
Cookies can help a website
		like ours recognize repeat users and allow a website to track web usage
		behavior.
Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no
		meaning outside of the assigning website.
For more details on cookies
and similar technologies, please visit		www.allaboutcookies.org.
2.2 Different Durations of Cookies
	

		Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time.
==========
“Session cookies” only last for as long as the browser session and are
		deleted automatically once you close your browser.
“Persistent cookies”
		cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration
		date set in the cookie (as determined by the party placing it), and
		help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the
		Internet again.
2.3 First Party and Third Party Cookies
	

		First party cookies are placed on a website directly by the owner of
		the site, in this case, W-Systems.
Third party cookies are placed on a
		website by third party providers (for example, by companies that
		provide advertising tracking or web analytics services) and by
		advertisers on the website.
We use both first-party cookies as well as
		third-party cookies, as described below.
==========
2.4 Pixel Tags
	

		We also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies), from the
		third parties described below, to get information about your usage of
		the Site and about your interaction with email or other communications.
Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in
		online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of
		tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has
		been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular content
		or a particular email message.

Cookies and Other Technologies Used On The Site



Cookie List
A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information.
Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies.
We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts.
More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:

Strictly Necessary 
These are necessary for the website or application to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
==========
They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.
You can set your browser or mobile device to block, but some parts of the site will not then work.
These services do not store any personally identifiable information.
==========
Performance 
This allows us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.
They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.
All information collected is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
==========
If you do not allow this service we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
Functional 
This enables the website or application to provide enhanced functionality and personalization.
They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.
If you do not allow then some or all of these services may not function properly.
==========
Targeting 
These may be set through our site by our advertising partners.
They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.
They do not store directly personably identifiable information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.
If you do not allow, you will still see advertisements but they will be less targeted to your likes.
