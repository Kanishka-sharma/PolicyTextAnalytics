What is personal data?
==========
The definition of personal data (also known as personal information) changes according to the legislative structure that regulates it.
In regards to European Legislation, more specifically the GDPR (‘General Data Protection Regulation), personal data is any data that can be used to ‘identify’ an individual.
==========
The definition could include anything from name, email address, passwords, usernames and can span right down to cookies or device identifiers.
What personal data does Blis collect?
We use cookies, mobile identifiers, tags, pixels, beacons, SDKs and other tracking technology to associate your usage data with you – or more accurately, with your device.
The personal data we hold about you is associated with a unique and pseudonymous identifier linked to your device.
We do not associate that identifier with your name, email, address, or phone number, because we don’t collect that type of directly identifying information about consumers.
==========
Why do you collect personal data?
Blis uses the personal data to provide advertising services to its clients and customers.
We use it to deliver more relevant advertising on behalf of our clients, to improve our products and services and to create new products.
==========
What is programmatic advertising?
Put simply, programmatic advertising is the automated buying and selling of advertising.
The methodologies are based on an efficient allocation model which allows advertisers to target their ads to the right users at the right time.
==========
This video explains the process in detail or you can read the example below to see how it works.
Through using a computer or mobile phone device, a user decides to visit either an app or a web page.
==========
Within a few milliseconds, the page sends out a bid-request asking advertisers to fill an advertising space with an ad of their choice.
The signal will contain information about the device so that the advertiser can fill the space with a more targeted advert.
==========
If the user has given their consent for the further processing of their data, then the bid-request would ultimately be competed for within an auction across a range of third-party companies (who would also have the right level of consent to process the user’s data).
Who do you share my personal data with?

==========
We may also (but we expect this to be very infrequent) share personal data with our professional advisers, such as lawyers and accountants, as well as government, police forces, and/or regulatory authorities (where legally appropriate to do so).
We may also share your personal data as part of actual or potential business sale of Blis or its assets, to prevent suspected fraud, to respond to claims asserted against us, or to comply with legal processes such as court order.
==========
