This Privacy Policy is to inform users how SendGrid.com uses and protects their personal information.
SCOPE
This Privacy Policy describes how SendGrid.com handles its users' personal information for our services related to the SendGrid.com websites.
It applies generally to the SendGrid.com website and any other related websites where this policy appears on the webpage ("the Sites").
Some SendGrid.com websites or websites operated by SendGrid.com may also be governed by separate privacy policies.
The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears at the bottom of the website.
Subject to the requirements of applicable law, SendGrid.com attempts to provide a consistent set of privacy practices.
By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, the user expressly consents to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of his or her personal information by SendGrid.com as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users.
==========
COLLECTION
Anyone can browse the Sites without revealing their identity or revealing any personal information to SendGrid.com.
However, once users give SendGrid.com their personal information, they are no longer anonymous to us.
If users choose to provide us with personal information, they consent to the transfer and storage of that information to SendGrid.com's servers located in the United States.
SendGrid.com may collect and store the following personal information:
E-mail address, physical contact information, and, if applicable, financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;
Transactional information based on users' activities on the Sites (such as email behavior you generate or that relates to your account);
Shipping, billing and other information users may provide to purchase an item;
Community discussions, chats, dispute resolutions, correspondence through the Sites, and correspondence sent to SendGrid.com;
Computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Sites, and advertising data;
Other information, including IP address and standard web log information; and
Supplemental information from third parties.
(For example, if a user incurs a debt to SendGrid.com, SendGrid.com will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about the user from a credit bureau, as permitted by law.
As another example, if the information a user provides cannot be verified, we may ask the user to send us additional information (such as driver's license information, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information confirming your address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information).
==========
MARKETING
SendGrid.com does not sell or rent a user's personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without the user's explicit consent.
SendGrid.com may combine a user's information with information collected from other companies (such as demographic data) to improve and personalize its services.
If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from SendGrid.com, indicate your preference following the directions you receive in the unwanted e-mail.
==========
Provide the services and customer support requested by its users;
Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce the User Agreement;
Customize, measure, and improve its services and the Sites' content and layout;
Tell users about targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on users' communication preferences; and
Compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.
OUR DISCLOSURE OF USER INFORMATION
SendGrid.com may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.
SendGrid.com may also share users' personal information with:
Members of SendGrid.com's corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint services;
Service providers under contract who help with SendGrid.com's business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, and affiliate programs, etc.);
Other third parties to whom users explicitly ask us to send their information;
Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity (in such events we will disclose name, city, state, telephone number, email address, User ID history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history); and
Other business entities, should SendGrid.com plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity (Should such an event occur, SendGrid.com will require that any new entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to its users' personal information.
If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice and be asked for consent).
Without limiting the above, SendGrid.com will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when SendGrid.com, in good faith, believes that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
==========
COOKIES
SendGrid.com may use "cookies" (small files placed on a user's hard drive) on certain pages of the Sites to help analyze web page flow, customize services, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.
A few important things you should know about cookies are that:
SendGrid.com may offer certain features that are only available through the use of cookies.
SendGrid.com may use cookies to help identify users and maintain a user's signed-in status.
Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
==========
Users are always free to decline our cookies if their browser permits, although doing so may interfere with the use of the Sites.
Users may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the Sites that SendGrid.com does not control.
(For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a "cookie" placed by that web page.)
==========
NO SPAM, SPYWARE OR SPOOFING
Neither SendGrid.com nor its Users will tolerate spam.
Make sure to set your SendGrid.com notification preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer.
Users are not licensed to add other SendGrid.com users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without express consent.
To report SendGrid.com related spam or spoof emails to SendGrid.com, please forward the email to info@sendgrid.com.
Users may not use SendGrid.com's communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement.
SendGrid.com filters and automatically scans messages before they are sent for viruses and other illegal or prohibited content but do not permanently store email messages sent through these tools.
If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community, SendGrid.com does not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose.
SendGrid.com does not rent or sell email addresses.
==========
ACCOUNT PROTECTION
A user's password is the key to the user's account.
SendGrid.com urges all users to use unique numbers, letters, and special characters when choosing a password.
Do not disclose your SendGrid.com password to anyone.
If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
==========
Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify SendGrid.com and change your password.
ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Users can see, review and change most of their personal information by logging into the Sites.
Generally, SendGrid.com will not manually modify a user's personal information.
Users must promptly update their personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.
Once a user makes a public posting, he or she may not be able to change or remove it.
==========
Upon your request, SendGrid.com will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.
SendGrid.com does retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce the SendGrid.com User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
SECURITY
All user information is stored on SendGrid.com's servers located in the United States.
SendGrid.com treats all data as an asset that must be protected and uses numerous tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure.
==========
However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse personal information that they collect from the Sites.
Therefore, although SendGrid.com works hard to protect its user's privacy, it does not promise, and users should not expect, that their personal information or private communications will always remain private.
THIRD PARTIES
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information collected from you.
If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers, or sellers on our Sites or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
==========
Since SendGrid.com does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties.
SendGrid.com encourages all users to ask questions before they disclose personal information to others.
GENERAL
SendGrid.com may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Site.
All amended terms automatically take effect thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the Site.
In addition, SendGrid.com will notify its users in accordance with your notification preferences.
If your questions are not answered online, you may write to us at: SendGrid.com, 4290 Brockton Avenue, Suite 202, Riverside, California 92501, or via e-mail at info@sendgrid.com.
