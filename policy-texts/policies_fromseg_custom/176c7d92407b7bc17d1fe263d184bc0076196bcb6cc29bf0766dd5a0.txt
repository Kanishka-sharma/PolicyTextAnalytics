Regent Media Privacy Policy




Effective Date: October 7, 2008


            We at Regent Media (including our subsidiaries, "Regent Media") are committed
            to protecting the privacy of our users.
We have prepared this privacy policy ("Privacy
            Policy") to inform you how we handle the information that we collect about
            you or that you choose to submit to us.
Unless a specific privacy policy resides at a particular property, this Privacy
            Policy applies to all Regent Media properties, including, without limitation and
            by way of example, regentmedia.com, regententertainment.com, advocate.com, out.com,
            menmagazine.com, freshmen.com, buygay.com, all sites in the GayWired Media network
            (www.gaywiredmedia.com), and any country-specific
            or foreign language versions thereof (collectively, the "Network").
Because
            the Network is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit
            may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries other than the one in
            which you reside.
By using the Network, you explicitly consent to such use of your
            information.
==========
This Privacy Policy complies with the Safe Harbor Principles of the European Commission's
            Directive on Data Protection.
Your California Privacy Rights

            Under California Civil Code section 1798.83, a California resident has the right
            to request and obtain either (1) information about certain companies' disclosures
            of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes, or (2) access
            to a cost-free means of preventing such disclosures.
As more fully described in
            this Privacy Policy, you may request that Regent Media not disclose your personal
            information to third parties.
You may do so either at the time you register, by
            following the instructions below in the "Modifications and Deactivations"
            section, or by contacting us by mail at 10990 Wilshire Blvd, Penthouse, Los Angeles,
            CA 90024.

Notice - Information We Automatically Collect

            We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how our users
            use the Network (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Usage
            Data").
For example, each time you visit the Network we automatically collect
            your IP address, browser and computer type, access times, the web page from which
            you came, and the web page(s) you access.
In addition, we use technologies called
            "cookies" and "tracking pixels" that allow us to enhance your
            experience on the Network (for example, to keep track of your purchases, to allow
            you to see information you've previously entered (like responses to member polls),
            to deliver content specific to your interests, and, if you tell us to do so, to
            save your member name and password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time
            you visit the Network or access an area of the Network that requires you to log
            in).
We use cookies to deliver advertisements that are most likely to interest you,
            based on the areas of the Network you visit, and the products, features and services
            you select on the Network.
We also may use cookies or tracking pixels to track information
            related to your searching and browsing of member profiles, such as which profiles
            you browse or respond to, search parameters of searches you conduct, the number
            of results returned by your searches, how you review, rank and respond to search
            results, and how often your profile is searched or browsed.
We may use such information
            to improve the functionality of the Network and to offer additional services, such
            as enhanced searching or automated user matching.
==========
In addition, third parties who
            place advertisements on the Network may also collect information through cookies
            or tracking pixels to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work
            properly and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements.
Cookies or
            tracking pixels set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies
            set by those third parties.
In addition, third-party partners, advertisers, and
            other web sites you may access via the Network have different privacy policies and
            are not subject to this privacy policy.
We recommend that you read the privacy statement
            of each web site to find out how your personal information is protected.

If you
            would like more information about these practices and to know your choices about
            not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.
From time to time we may share Usage Data with third parties.
We do so, however,
            only in the aggregate and not in a manner that will enable the recipient to personally
            identify you, unless you have given us permission to do so.
In addition, we may
            combine Usage Data with Personal Information (as defined below) (collectively, “Combined
            Data”) in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.
We
            do so, however, only for our own internal purposes and will not share such Combined
            Data with third parties unless you have given us permission to do so or we are required
            to do so by law.
==========
Information You Choose To Submit

            When you subscribe to a magazine, order a product, register to become a Network
            member or when you participate in certain Network activities (e.g., contests or
            surveys), we may ask that you provide us with demographic information (e.g., gender,
            age, zip code) and with information through which you could be contacted (e.g.,
            your full name, postal or e-mail address, or phone number) (which we will refer
            to in this privacy policy collectively as "Personal Information").
The
            e-mail address you provide will be used only to contact you about account(s) you
            may have with us.
Your e-mail address will never be rented or sold to any third
            party.
==========
If you have any questions about the use of your email address or Personal
            Information, you may contact our customer service department at Regent Media, 10990
            Wilshire Blvd, Penthouse, Los Angeles, CA 90024.
On occasion, your postal address
            and/or other Personal Information may be used to market to you carefully screened
            direct-mail offers about products or services from other organizations that we think
            may be of interest of you.
If you prefer not to receive such direct mail offers,
            you can mail your request to our customer service department at Regent Media, P.O.
            Box 311, Newburgh New York 12551 or call (800) 827-2760.
==========
In addition, when you order
            products or services through the Network, we may ask that you provide us with information
            (e.g., credit card number, billing, and shipping information) we will need to enable
            us to provide you with the requested product or service.
We will share such information
            (e.g., to our billing vendors) with third parties to the extent necessary to fulfill
            your order or to complete the Network activity.
Other Authorized Disclosures

            Notwithstanding anything in this privacy policy to the contrary, we may share any
            information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) in response
            to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise
            our legal rights or defend against legal claims or demands; (2) if we believe it
            is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
            activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any
            person; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
            regarding situations that involve abuse of our Network infrastructure or the Internet
            in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts
            to compromise the security of the Network infrastructure); (4) to a parent company,
            subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Regent
            Media (in which case we will require such entities to honor this privacy policy);
            and (5) if Regent Media is acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case
            we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this privacy policy).
Public Areas

            Your use of areas of the Network that are intended for interaction with other users
            (e.g., personal ads, chat rooms, online polls, and message boards) may reveal your
            member name and e-mail address and may allow you to publish certain personal information
            about you.
By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone
            may access and forward any information about you that is contained in or that you
            post to those areas.
==========
While chat, e-mail, and instant message-like conversations
            pass through our servers, our practice is not to store contents of such communications.
We do, however, temporarily store logs of certain data related to such communications,
            such as the length and frequency of messaging and the Network member with whom communications
            are exchanged.
We may use such data to improve the functionality of the Network
            and to offer additional services, such as enhanced searching or automated user matching.
Data Integrity and Security

            We take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse
            and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
We also take reasonable
            steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant for the purposes for which
            it is to be used and that the Usage Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate,
            complete, and current.
==========

            If you would like to modify any Personal Information you previously submitted through
            the Network, visit your account information section for each Network property to
            which you made the submission.

            each Network property.
Please note, however, that we reserve the right to send you
            administrative messages relating to the Network (e.g., about changes to this privacy
            policy).

            remove it from public and member viewing on the Network, please write to us at our
            corporate address or visit your account information section for each Network property.

            after deactivation, and (2) we are not responsible for removing information about
            you from the database(s) of any third parties to whom Personal Information has been
            shared prior to our receipt of an opt-out request from you.
As more fully described in this Privacy Policy, you may request that Regent Media
            not disclose your personal information to third parties.

            and content, we may make changes to our privacy policy and will reflect those changes
            in this statement.
We may update this policy from time to time.
If we make any significant
            changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information about you, we will inform
            you of such changes via e-mail or by posting a notice on relevant areas of the Network.
