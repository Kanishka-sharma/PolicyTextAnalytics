Neither Batanga Media nor such third party ad serving party uses these cookies to personally identify you in any way and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.

==========
In the course of providing online advertising services to websites and advertisers, Batanga Media may use pixel tags (also known as clear GIFs or web beacons).
A pixel tag is a line of code that is placed on a website by the website owner which enables us to analyze advertising campaigns and the general usage patterns of visitors to their websites.
In all such instances, the pixel tag is programmed to collect only anonymous information about your visit to a particular website, for example, pages viewed, number of visits, navigation history through the website, or other statistics.
==========
This non-personally-identifiable information is sent to our ad server for processing.
Businesses often use a pixel tag to better understand the traffic patterns of visitors to a website or enable us to target ads to those visitors on other websites.
Batanga MEdia provides services to websites and advertisers and, accordingly, may use pixel tag information for reporting about website traffic or to deliver targeted advertising to your browser.
In this case, it will be Batanga Media’s policy to require those websites which use Batanga Media cookies or pixel tags to provide an appropriate notice in their privacy policies explaining our relationship.
Although we believe that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web (by not repeatedly serving the same ads to you and delivering more relevant messages to you), neither Batanga Media nor its third party ad serving party needs cookies to deliver ads to you.
Web Users have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in their browser.
Please see your browser supplier’s website for details on how to do this.
