Terms of Service

Welcome to 110mb!
Here your dreams and 
    ambitions, your obsessions and occupations can be displayed and shared with 
    the world.
110mb provides every member with 110MB of FREE space to host 
    a web site of their own.
==========
All we ask in return is that you follow a few 
    simple rules.
So before you create your first page here at 110mb, 
    please be sure you have read, and understood, these Terms and Conditions.
Members who do not follow rules and regulations could find their entire web 
    site removed and/or deleted, possibly without prior notice.
The 
    interpretation of these guidelines is at the sole discretion of 110mb:
    


110mb is capable of giving away 110MB of free web space thanks to 
      the link back to our page.
In return, each page that you create 
      will have a link back automatically inserted into it (at the footer of the 
		page).
You may not remove, 
      resize so as to render invisible or unreadable, or otherwise block any of 
      the link back that 110mb inserts onto your web pages.
You must provide a valid email address; 
110mb is not responsible for the content of any personal home 
      page, nor do the opinions or ideas expressed in user-generated web pages 
      necessarily reflect those of 110mb.
The contents of user-generated 
      web pages are not reviewed or censored in any way before they appear on 
      110mb;
You may not set up a "gateway" site on the 110mb server.
A 
      "gateway" site is one which serves only as an entrance to the actual site 
      located on a non-110mb server;
Your page should be in English, Italian, French, Chinese or German languages;
Your page should be active - that is, it is either receiving 'hits' or 
      is being updated/posted to.
Sites that either receive no hits or are not 
      updated over a period of 60 days will be considered 'inactive' and may be 
      removed by 110mb to make room for other users;
You may not use your web space to provide material, or links to 
      material, that is grossly offensive to the Web community.

        of third parties;
Promotion of physical harm or injury against any group or 
        individual;

      located on the 110mb server;

        graphics, designs, films, and music), those which allow the 
        circumvention of revenue rightfully due to a manufacturer for the sale 
        of a product or the disabling of installed copy protected devices, and 
        all other forms of cracker utilities, are strictly forbidden;


You may not use your web space for 'data warehousing' ; that is, using 
      our space as storage for large files which are only linked from other 
      sites;
