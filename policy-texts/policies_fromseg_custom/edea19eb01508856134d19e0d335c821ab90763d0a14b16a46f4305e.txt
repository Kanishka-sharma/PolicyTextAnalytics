Each time

accessed.
We may also use it to monitor usage patterns on the website in order 
to improve navigation and design features to help you get information more 
easily.
This information is provided to us as daily logged files.
In order to 
help us develop the website and our services, we may provide such aggregate 
information to third parties.
The statistics however will not include any 
information that can be used to identify any individual.
==========
To whom will personal information be 
disclosed?

date secure and confidential.
Corporate location information however may be 
shared.

==========
How is personal information stored 
and protected
Your personal data is 
stored by us in electronic and paper-based form.
Website usage information is 
stored electronically.
Security
The information we collect 
about site visitors the site, is stored in secure environments and we do not 
share any data that identifies any individual, to any other individual or party.
We have mechanisms in place to protect data.
One such mechanism is called a 
"firewall".
A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through.
It safeguards our computer systems and your information.
We also use system and 
application logs to track all access.
We review these logs periodically and 
investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.
==========
We understand that the 
security of your information is important to you.
We also understand that our 
continued success as a publisher on the web, relies on our ability to 
communicate with you in a secure manner.
We adhere to the highest standards of 
decency, fairness, and integrity in our operations.
==========
We use several measures to 
authenticate your identity when you visit our site.
We also take steps to 
protect your information as it travels the internet, and to make sure all 
information is as secure as possible against unauthorised access and use (for 
example, by hackers).
We review our security measures regularly.
Despite our best efforts, 
and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect security" does not exist on the 
internet, or anywhere else.
As a result, whilst we strive to protect your 
personal information, we cannot warrant the security of the information you 
transmit to us online.
You therefore do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your 
transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our system.
==========
Authentication
You should not share your 
user name and password with other people.
If you think you might lose or forget 
these identifiers, write them down and keep each in a separate place.

BMJ Publishing Group Limited is not encrypted.
It will be stored securely within 
our corporate firewall (see above ).
