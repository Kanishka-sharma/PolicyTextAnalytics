Bidstack Limited Privacy Policy
Bidstack is a cross-platform in-game advertising network, whose technology helps video-game companies and advertisers to benefit from revolutionary advertising opportunities.
Game developers and publishers can monetise their games by integrating adverts naturally into the game environment, and advertisers can use our technology to run targeted campaigns within these spaces.
The Bidstack services (the 'Services') include the integration of Bidstack’s advertising technology into games by the game developers, via our SDK or API.
Advertisers are then able to buy space within the game.
They can select which games to feature in, or the demographic profile they’re targeting – and then use our reporting tools to track campaign performance.
