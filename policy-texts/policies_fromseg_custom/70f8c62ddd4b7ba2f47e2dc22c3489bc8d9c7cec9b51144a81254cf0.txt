Data Protection/Privacy

Reuters and its affiliates seek to comply worldwide with the European Union Data Protection Directive and require those to whom they transfer personal data to do the same.
This way Reuters works to protect personal data transferred outside the European Economic Area.
The main principles of the Directive are that processing of personal data must be fair and reasonable and personal data should be secure, accurate and up-to-date.
Generally speaking, each time we want to collect personal data we must first tell you the purposes for which we will use the data and then ask for your consent.
==========
We can only use your data for the purposes for which you consent.
We must also tell you if we will transfer your data to anyone else.
==========
This means that if we place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, it will not be related to information about you unless we have told you what we are collecting and obtained your consent to it.
Until then the cookie will only track general usage patterns and will not be used to identify you.
==========
You have a right to ask us at any time not to contact you by way of direct marketing and the Directive allows you to write and ask to see and correct data held about you.
Reuters general principle is not to sell personal data about its customers or users to people outside the Reuters Group.
If you have any questions about Reuters Data Protection policy you should fill out a feedback form.
