The Monkey takes user privacy pretty dang seriously.
Our goal is to make PicMonkey a great experience.
However, as much as we love you, we are not interested in knowing everything about you.
==========
Here's the scoop in layman's terms:  the collection, use, and preservation of personal information by PicMonkey will only happen for making PicMonkey a better, faster, or more convenient for you.
The disclosure of personal information will never occur without your explicit consent.
So, does PicMonkey use cookies?
Yes, PicMonkey does set cookies to make your experience better.
No, you can't eat these cookies!
A cookie is actually a small data file that is transferred to your device.
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.
You can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from any website you visit.
If you do this, it's possible that PicMonkey might not work as well.
Are the images I upload to PicMonkey public?
==========
Nope.
Negative.
No siree bob.
Can anyone use my image?
No silly, you own your images!
The copyright for the image remains with you even after you use PicMonkey.
We will never use your image without your consent.
For example, if we want to feature one of your public images on our blog, or use your photography on our site, the Monkey will contact you before ever publishing your work.
==========
Does PicMonkey save email addresses?
PicMonkey will save your email address so we can keep you up to date.
Other email addresses you associated with your personal account may also be stored.
Will any of my personal information be shared with 3rd parties?
No.
==========
If it were up to us, spammers would be put in a monkey barrel!
If PicMonkey is ever acquired, we will provide notice before any personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
It's not our goal to be acquired, but we feel that it's prudent to be clear about your rights if it happens.
==========
Your ongoing support of PicMonkey will ensure that we will never have to sell to another company.
Will this privacy policy change?
As PicMonkey evolves, this privacy policy is likely to evolve with it.
We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent.
We will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
We also adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (ProTip: this has nothing to do with boats).
