PRIVACY AT MiQ
At MiQ, privacy is a top priority and we provide the below Privacy Policies to outline our practices and procedures to enable you to make an informed decision about sharing information with us.
We have 2 separate policies, depending on your country of residence:
Privacy for online users in the EU
Privacy for online users outside of the EU
PRIVACY NOTICE RELATING TO ONLINE USERS IN THE EU 
This Privacy Notice provides information on the processing of personal data of online users in the EU by MiQ.
The information contained in this Privacy Notice supersedes the Information Notice for Non-European users in the event of any inconsistencies.
==========
MiQ Digital Limited (MiQ) is the controller of the personal data processed in the EU.
Personal data processed by MiQ
MiQ collects and processes online identifiers, such as IP addresses, information collected by means of cookies and, in the instance of mobile app ads, a device ID, all of which may reveal a user’s location, timestamp, device information, online transactions and websites accessed.
MiQ does not collect or process the names, physical or email address, or phone numbers of individual users.
Nonetheless, the information collected and processed by MiQ may constitute personal data within the meaning of the EU data protection laws.
MiQ uses the information it collects to create broad user profiles for the purpose of enabling advertisers to optimise the delivery of digital advertisements to online users.
Users are categorised in various segments through the use of MiQ’s software so that they can be served advertisements that are likely to be of interest to them.
Information about online user behaviour is collected via cookies, IP addresses, device IDs, and via third parties to better target ad campaigns to ensure each ad shown is displayed to those users who may be most interested in the product or service advertised.
The data collected as part of the ad campaign may also be used to develop insight reports for MiQ clients concerning advertising trends and campaign results; however, these reports only contain data that is provided in an aggregated form and do not allow for the identification of individuals.
==========
Your Choices
When you visit a website that serves ads which are personalised using MiQ’s software, you are given the option not to participate in our ad campaigns by clicking on the Adchoices icon and setting your preferences within the Adchoices web page.
This icon is displayed on all websites that present ads using MiQ.
Please visit youronlinechoices.com if you would like more information about your digital advertising choices.

Please see more information on how to disable cookies in the ‘Cookies and Other Similar Technologies’ section below.
Data retention
MiQ minimises the personal data it collects about users and retains the data for only limited periods.
Raw data that MiQ collects about EU online user activities is kept for no longer than 2 years, after which the user-level data is aggregated, meaning the information is expressed only in a summary form relating to large groups of individuals.
Cookies and other Similar Technologies
Information on the cookies and similar technologies that MiQ sets if users elect to be part of MiQ ad campaigns is provided in the table below.

Information we collect
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
As part of our on-going efforts to deliver the most applicably targeted advertisements to our clients, MiQ Digital may collect and use log files, web beacons, cookies, device information, location information, and information available through other technologies, each as further defined below, to collect data from browsers and devices, advertiser sites, third party sites (“Sites”), and mobile applications.
The Information collected is used to inform our propensity models, which are then used primarily for ad targeting purposes, and as otherwise noted below in the section titled “How We Use Your Information.”
Such information enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of MiQ Digital’s services.
==========
“Cookies” are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device, which may include, for example, your computer, tablet, smartphone or other PDA.
We may use Cookies for purposes that include estimating the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display.
Cookies allow advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach.
==========
Cookies are also used to improve the user experience online.
They may be used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement, and to provide users with more relevant advertising.
There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) “Session Cookies” are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) “Persistent Cookies” can remain on your browser for up to 2 years from your last visit to the Sites (but more commonly 90 days) and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.
A useful resource on understanding Cookies may be found at http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
==========
“Device Information” is information we automatically collect and store related to the device used when you visit Sites and mobile applications, including the type of device you are using (e.g., an iPhone), certain device identifiers that are unique to the device you are using, and your internet service provider.
“Location Information” is information acquired from your device’s global position system (GPS) signal, WiFi networks proximately accessible to your device, nearby cell towers, and other available location data.
When you use location enabled services on a Site or mobile application with location-enabled services, this type of information may be made available to us.
==========
“Other Technologies Information” relates to information that is now or may in the future become available through new technologies and the non-PII related information you share or otherwise make available.
How we use your information
Information Used and Shared by MiQ Digital
MiQ Digital will only use the Information we collect about you for the limited purposes provided for in this Privacy Policy.
This includes using and sharing Information (1) to deliver or assist our clients in delivering targeted ads to potential customers or other individuals; (2) to enable third party service providers to assist or facilitate in the services we provide to our clients; (3) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (4) to enforce our terms of use or to protect our rights ; (5) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service; (6) with other MiQ Digital entities, affiliates, and third party marketing partners (including advertisers and publishers) for marketing purposes; (7) with vendors, administrative service providers, technology providers, and carefully selected partners for data validation, enhancement, information verification and suppression services; and/or (8) for any other purpose for which you provide consent.
We also may share Information with advertisers, publishers and other third parties for marketing purposes, but such Information does not include PII.
When targeting advertising campaigns on behalf of our clients, we may or may not choose to target users based on their Non-PII.
This includes, but is not limited to, IP host address, the date and time of activity online, the pages viewed, browser type, referring URL, Internet Service Provider and operating system.
We do not collect PII such as name, address, phone number, email address, credit card information, financial account information, or anything else that can personally identify individuals on behalf of our clients.
==========
Our use of Non-PII when targeting advertising campaigns is to ensure that MiQ delivers the most appropriate and tailored ads to audiences online.
Advertising campaigns delivered on behalf of our clients may include “interest-based” ads, which utilize Non-PII we have collected or received about your activities and interests across your linked devices or in connection with a single online action, such as visiting a particular website.
This type of interest-based advertising is sometime referred to as “retargeting.”
In connection with this type of interest-based advertising, we may use propensity models to predict users that may be interested in certain categories or “segments.”
==========
For instance, if you have recently visited a real estate website and a mortgage website, you may be placed in a “prospective homebuyer” segment, which may result in advertisers interested in this segment, such as a real estate broker, to show you, along with others in that segment, ads related to their offerings.
In some cases, we may use Non-PII, non-sensitive, health-related topics, such as data related to visiting websites about acne or dry eyes, to create segments which our advertisers may use to retarget the users in that segment.
We create propensity models and use said models for targeting or retargeting.
These segments are created using algorithms to identify the set of consumer (non-health) variables most highly correlated with the profile of individuals with the specific health condition.
No health data is ever used in the application of the models, making the approach HIPAA-compliant and privacy-safe.
Click here for a full list of the standard interest segments for interest-based advertising that are based on health-related information or interests used by MiQ Digital in performing its services.
Information Collected by Third Party Sites 
Please be aware that the websites and mobile applications of our advertiser clients, as well as the websites and mobile applications on which we place advertisements either on our own behalf or on behalf of our clients, or any third party websites or mobile applications linked to one of our Sites or with which have agreed to place a cookie on their site on our behalf or on behalf of our advertiser, may collect Non-PII information from you.
Such information may include non-personally identifiable information through the use of Cookies and other technology (as described above), and with respect to third party sites and mobile applications, any personally identifiable information you may choose to give in registering and transacting with such website.
==========
This data, excluding PII, may be combined with data collected by MiQ Digital and used for ad targeting purposes.

Please note that opting out does not block ads, rather it stops tracking.
==========
Alternatively, visit youradchoices.com
If you have multiple internet browsers or users on the same computer or device, you will need to perform the optout operation for each browser, device and/or user.
If you or your privacy software deletes the opt-out Cookie from your computer, browser or device, you will need to repeat the process.
Mobile Application Opt-Out 
Mobile devices allow users to opt-out of the collection of usage information within their mobile apps.
You can choose to opt-out in your device settings by selecting “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android devices and “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS devices.
Location Opt-Out 
By updating the location preferences on your device, or by updating the settings for individual apps, you can block the collection of location data.
==========
Multiple Device & Browser Opt-Out 
We may use cross-device mapping services in order to link devices that belong to the same user or household.
Users can opt-out of the collection of information for each device and browser by taking the steps mentioned above (i.e. opt-outs are not effective across multiple devices, even if said devices are linked for advertising purposes).
However, opting out of the collection of information for one device or browser will not result in you being opted-out of the collection of information for other devices or browsers.
As such, you may need to opt-out of multiples devices and browsers.
Please note that use of the opt-out Cookie will affect our ability to provide you content and advertisements that will more effectively match your interests and may prevent us from controlling the frequency with which you may view any particular advertisement.
Please report any problems related to the opt-out process, or any complaints with regards to online behavioural advertising data and its use, to privacy@miqdigital.com.
RETENTION
We retain Non-PII for use to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests.

==========
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law to guard your information.
While we take precautions against possible breaches in our service and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure.
Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.
