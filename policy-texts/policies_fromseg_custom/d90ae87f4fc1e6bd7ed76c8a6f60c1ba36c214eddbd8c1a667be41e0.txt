The TD Bank Financial Group commitment to privacy
Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way we do business within TD Bank Financial Group(TDBFG).
We strive to provide you with the best customer service.
To us, that includes treating you fairly and with respect.
The TD Privacy Code² informs you of our policy on privacy, and tells you about the ways we help ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your information are protected.
Our Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy informs you of the policies and practices we have in place relating to the management of personal information at TDBFG.
==========
The word "information" means personal, financial and other details about you that you provide to us and we obtain from others outside our organization, including through the products and services you use.
This policy applies to personal customers, including individuals carrying on business alone or in partnership with other individuals and signing officers of our business customers.
It consists of five key principles:
1.
==========
Collecting and using information
Either before or when we collect information about you, we will explain how we intend to use it.
We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes, and we will use it only for those purposes.
We will obtain your consent if we wish to use your information for any other purpose and before collecting information from third parties such as credit bureaus.
Your personal financial information is used to help us manage operations and risk within TDBFG.
Your information is also used in order to satisfy valid information requests from regulators and other organizations or individuals who are legally entitled to make such requests.
==========
Call Taping
We may monitor and/or record your telephone discussions with our representatives for our mutual protection, to enhance customer service, and to confirm our discussions with you.
Customers who prefer not to have their calls taped can transact business at a branch location, through EasyWebTM Internet banking, or through automated banking machines.
Email comments, questions or responses
When you send us an email or when you ask us to respond to you by email, we learn your exact email address and any information you have included in the email.
We use your email address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further.
We will not sell your email address to anyone outside TDBFG.
We may use your email address to send you information about offers on products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.
If you don't want us to contact you by email with offers on products and services, you may tell us so at any time.
If you have asked us to put you on an email mailing list to provide you with certain information on a regular basis, or if we send you information about our offers on products and services by email, we may use web beacons or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links on our website you click.
We use this information to improve usability and to improve future communications.
==========
None of this is associated with you as an individual.
It is measured only in aggregate.
You may ask us to remove you from the emailing list at any time (using the unsubscribe instructions provided with each email and on the site where you signed up).
2.
==========
Releasing information
We may provide your information to other persons in situations where -
we have your consent
the other parties are our suppliers or agents who assist us in serving you
we are required or permitted to do so by law or applicable regulators and self-regulatory organizations
transfers of a business are involved
3.
Protecting information
We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We will retain your information only for the time it is required for the purposes we explain.
4.
==========
Providing information access and accuracy
We will give you access to the information we retain about you.
We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.
5.
==========
Respecting and responding to your privacy concerns
In the TD Privacy Code, we will explain your options for refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use and release of your information, and we will record and respect your choices.
We will investigate and respond to your concerns about any aspect of our handling of your information.
In the TD Privacy Code, we will explain how we fulfill each of these important principles.
==========
Why we ask for your information
We ask you for information to establish and serve you as our customer.
At the time you begin a relationship with us and during the course of our relationship, we may collect information about you.
We obtain most of our information about you directly from you.
The information we ask for depends on which product or service you want.
For every product or service, we need your name, address, birthdate, occupation and some identification.
Here is why we need some of the other information we ask you to provide.
• Birthdate
This helps us identify you and ensure that no one is trying to impersonate you.
We may also use it to determine your eligibility for products and services that may be of benefit to a particular age group.
==========
• Social Insurance Number (SIN)
Your SIN is required for products which earn investment income, in order to comply with the Canada Revenue Agency's income reporting requirements.
Providing your SIN for credit products is optional.
If you provide your SIN, we also use it to keep your information separate from that of other customers with a similar name, including information we obtain with your consent through the credit approval process.
• Employer name and address
This is required when a new account is opened or when you apply for credit in order to comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
• Financial information
This is used to assess your eligibility for any credit product, for example, a TD Visa* card, line of credit or other loan.
==========
We also use it to ensure that the advice we give you or the investments you purchase (in the case of mutual funds or brokerage or investment accounts) are appropriate for you.
We may collect information from you and service providers with whom you make arrangements to provide those services (for example when you set up bill payments through your account).
We will use your financial information, including transaction records that reflect your business dealings with and through us, to help us serve you as a customer and meet your financial needs.
• Health information
This is required for some insurance products to ensure you are eligible for coverage, and may also be used to investigate and adjudicate your claims, and to help manage and assess our risks.
The health-related information you provide in connection with an insurance product will never be shared within TDBFG; however, it may be shared with administrators, service providers and reinsurers of the insurance operations to process your insurance transactions.
==========
We only collect the information we need and only use it for the purposes explained to you.
When you apply for a new product or service, we will indicate in the application or agreement how we intend to use your information.
We will only ask for the information we need for that particular product or service.
We will indicate clearly which information would help us to serve you but is optional for you to provide.
==========
How we obtain your consent
It is important to understand the different ways that we may obtain your consent to collect, use, disclose and share your personal information.
Depending on the situation and the sensitivity of the information, we may obtain your consent in different ways.
Express consent may be obtained verbally, online or in writing.
Implied consent may be obtained through your use of a product, or when you approach us to obtain products or services from us.
We will not make your consent a condition of obtaining a product or service, unless it is reasonably or legally required, and we will clearly indicate when this is the case.
==========
Why we share your information
We share information within TDBFG to manage our business risks and operations, and to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
With your consent, we may share your information within TDBFG.
This will help us serve you better and determine whether any products or services of TDBFG are suitable for you so that we can offer them to you.
We want to serve you better and meet your customer service expectations.
==========
Agreeing to let us share your information within TDBFG helps us to meet this goal.
Sharing information lets us instantly recognize your total relationship with TDBFG, no matter when or where you contact us or which one of us you contact.
It also means that in some circumstances, changes to your information can be made once and be effective for all your products or services with TDBFG.
Sharing your information also helps us determine your financial needs because it allows us to review what TDBFG products you have and how you use them.
We may then offer you other TDBFG products and services - including special promotions - that we believe will be of interest to you.
This consent is optional and you can decide to withdraw it at any time for the purposes listed above.
==========
Please refer to the "Respecting your preference" section.
Why we ask others for information about you
With your consent, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including credit reporting agencies.
Obtaining additional information about you from parties outside TDBFG helps us assess your eligibility for our products.
==========
For credit products, for example, we need to know your creditworthiness.
For this reason, we may contact other lenders or credit reporting agencies to get information about you and your credit history.
We may also contact employers or other personal references to verify information that you have given us.
We will not do this without your consent, but please remember that if you do not give your consent we may not be able to extend credit products to you.
==========
When we release your information
We do not sell or rent customer lists or personal information to others.
However, we may release your information to parties outside TDBFG in certain circumstances, which include -
• With your consent
On an ongoing basis, we will disclose your credit history with us to other lenders or credit reporting agencies in order to support the credit process.
We release only the information required to identify you, as well as facts from our credit records about your repayment history.
We may disclose your account information to a joint account holder, including information about the account prior to it becoming a joint account.
==========
• For servicing purposes
We give a limited amount of information, only as necessary, without your consent, to our suppliers and agents; for example, cheque printers and bank card manufacturers who provide goods and services to you through us.
These suppliers and agents may be located in Canada or other jurisdictions or countries, and may disclose information in response to valid demands or requests from governments, regulators, courts and law enforcement authorities in those jurisdictions or countries.
• When required or permitted to do so by law or applicable regulators and self-regulatory organizations
We may release information in response to a search warrant, court order, or other demand or enquiry which we believe to be valid.
This may include requests from regulators, including self-regulators, who are responsible for ensuring TDBFG is in compliance with applicable regulations (e.g.
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Investment Dealers Association of Canada).
We may disclose information to help us collect a debt owed to us by you.
We may also disclose information to an investigative body in the case of a breach of agreement or contravention of law - this helps prevent fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity.
• Transfers of a business
As TDBFG continues to develop and grow, we may buy or sell parts of our businesses.
As our businesses consist primarily of our customer relationships, personal customer information and information regarding the particular account or service being purchased or sold would generally be one of the transferred business assets.
==========
How we protect your information
We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We have thorough security standards to protect our systems and your information against unauthorized access and use.
For example, our systems have been designed to ensure that your Personal Identification Number (PIN), password and other access codes are always private and confidential.
For your protection, your access codes are known only to you - our employees cannot gain access to them and they will not ask you to reveal them.
==========
All our suppliers and agents, as part of their contracts with TDBFG, are bound to maintain your confidentiality and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose.
When we provide information in response to a legal inquiry or order, we ensure that the order is valid and we disclose only the information that is legally required.
Email sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted.
If TDBFG requests that you transmit confidential information to us over the Internet when filling out an application online, we ensure that such transmission is encrypted.
We recommend that you use caution when forwarding free-format email messages to us and that you do not include confidential information (such as account numbers) in those messages, as they are not encrypted.
EasyWeb Secure Inbox is a safe and encrypted method for you to ask questions that require confidential information or are specific to your account.
==========
Important Information About Preventing Email Fraud: From time to time, fraudulent emails may be circulated to you claiming to have been issued by Canadian banks, requesting customers to verify their personal and/or banking information.
Customers are often asked to click on a link in the email that directs them to a pop-up window or modified online banking login page to enter their respective bank's login ID and password.
We will never send email messages to customers requesting confidential information such as passwords or account numbers.
Please do not act on any such emails as you may compromise your banking information by following links to a counterfeit Internet site(s).
==========
All employees of TDBFG are familiar with the procedures that must be taken to safeguard customer information.
And to us, protecting the confidentiality of your information is more than a procedure - it's part of our job.
It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.
We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure that they are being properly administered and that they remain effective and appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
==========
We retain your information only as long as it is required for the reasons it was collected.
The length of time we retain information varies depending on the product or service and the nature of the information.
This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us but only for so long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issue that may arise at a later date.
When your information is no longer needed for the purposes explained to you, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form.
Your right to access your information
We will give you access to the information we have about you.
If requested, we will assist you in making your request.
Most of this information is in the form of your transaction records.
==========
These are available to you through your account statements or passbook updates, by visiting the branch or office where your account is held, or by accessing your account through our EasyWeb Internet banking, EasyLine™ telephone banking, Green Machine* automated banking machines, and WebBroker* Internet brokerage service.
If you require other information, simply contact or forward a written request to the branch or office where your account is held.
We will ask you for specific details such as branch and account number.
We will advise you in advance if a minimal charge will be required for conducting the search, and we will respond to your request within 30 days.
==========
Please note that we may not be able to provide information about you from our records which contains references to other persons, is subject to legal privilege, contains confidential information proprietary to TDBFG, relates to an investigation of a breach of agreement or contravention of laws, or cannot be disclosed for other legal reasons.
If you have any questions regarding decisions made about you, we will tell you the reasons for those decisions.
Where relevant, we will provide you with the name and address of the credit bureau from which a report was obtained.
Keeping your information accurate
We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.
Having accurate information about you enables us to give you the best possible service and minimize the possibility that out of date information may be used to make a decision which impacts you.
Allowing us to share your information within TDBFG means that, in some circumstances, updates to your information can be made once and be effective for all the products and services you have with TDBFG.
==========
We have policies and procedures to help us maintain the accuracy of your information.
For most updates, we rely on you for information.
You can help by keeping us informed of any changes, such as if you move or change telephone numbers.
If you find any errors in our information about you, let us know and we will make the corrections immediately, and make sure they are conveyed to anyone we may have misinformed.
For information that remains in dispute, we will note your opinion in the file.
==========
Respecting your preference
We will explain your options of refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use or release of your information, and, given reasonable notice, we will record and respect your choices.
In most cases you are free to refuse or withdraw your consent at any time.
You may do so by contacting the branch or office where your account is held or by calling us at 1-800-430-6095.
Our staff will be pleased to explain your options and any consequences of refusing or withdrawing your consent, and record your choices.
There are several privacy preferences available to you, subject to legal, business or contractual requirements.
==========
If you prefer, you may choose not to have us -
Use your Social Insurance Number with credit reporting agencies as an aid to identify you
Conduct a credit check in order to assess an application for credit
In doing so, however, we may not be able to extend credit services to you.
Once you have a credit product with us, we will share your credit experience on an ongoing basis with other lenders and credit reporting agencies.
You cannot withdraw your consent for this sharing of information as it is necessary to support the credit process.
==========
Contact you occasionally either by mail, telephone, or email, or all of these methods, with direct marketing offers that may be of benefit to you
This does not include messages or other information about promotional offers we provide on, or enclosed with, your written or electronic account statements, or that we may discuss while talking with you.
Any marketing campaigns that are already underway may not immediately take your preferences into account.
Share your financial and account information with other members of TDBFG
This does not apply if you have requested a product or service that is jointly offered by more than one member of TDBFG.
Contact you to participate in customer research and surveys

If you have any questions, concerns or problems about privacy, confidentiality or how a request for information was handled, we encourage you to let us know, and you can take the following actions.

Our online Privacy Policy
Many of you have questions about how we handle the information we obtain from you when you visit our websites.
This Online Privacy Policy will answer your questions about the information we collect and how we use it.
Our use of Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing certain pieces of data that a website creates when you visit the site.
When you visit a website, a cookie may be used to track the activities of your browser as well as provide you with a consistent, more efficient experience.
There are three common types of cookies that we use, "session cookies" "persistent cookies" and “Flash cookies”:
Session cookies store information only for the length of time that you are connected to a website - they are not written onto your hard drive.
==========
Once you leave the website, they expire and are no longer active.
Persistent cookies are more permanent and store information on your hard drive.
Persistent cookies can be re-read when you return to the site that placed them on your hard drive.
Flash cookies are data files that a website creates when you visit the site and are most often used to enhance your web-browsing experience.
For more information about Flash cookies or to learn how to remove Flash cookies, please visit www.adobe.com
On our websites we use session, persistent and Flash cookies in the following ways:
We use session cookies:
to learn:
which pages are visited and what action you have taken;
the address of the websites and advertisements that link directly to our sites;
the keywords used for searches that brought you to our websites;
about the browser version and operating system you use;
your internet protocol (IP) address; and
your internet service provider (ISP) and the region from which you’re connecting to our site.
==========
as a type of digital signature to identify your current session to our web server.
We use persistent cookies in the following ways:
to remember your language preference and automatically input your Access Card number or Connect ID if you choose the option on our login screen;
to assist us in authenticating you and your computer and to administer EasyWeb and WebBroker IdentificationPlus;
to ensure that any online offer which you have already responded to is not presented again each time you login to our Internet banking site;
to analyze which products and services you have used which allows us to optimize our sites and to provide a more personalized experience while you utilize TDBFG websites;
to help manage our online advertising and site personalization.
Once you have successfully logged into EasyWeb or WebBroker we associate you with a TD internal identifier that identifies you as our customer.
This enables us to learn which advertisements are best for our customers and allows us to deliver interest-based advertisements based on your behaviour.
Although the TD internal identifier allows us to know who you are, the cookie will never contain information that would allow a third party to know who you are such as: your name, address, telephone number or email address.
==========
We use both session and persistent cookies to:
assist us with application support issues and to aid in fraud investigations;
determine how many people visit our websites and which sections of the sites are visited most frequently.
This helps us to understand what type of information is most useful to our website visitors so that we can improve our websites and makes it easier for our website visitors to access information.
We record statistical information on the numbers of visitors to our websites.
We use Flash cookies:

Managing Your Cookies
If you prefer not to accept cookies, you may adjust your browser settings to notify you when a cookie is about to be sent, or you may configure your browser to refuse cookies automatically.
If you would like to learn more about your cookie options, please refer to your browser's documentation or online help for instructions.
If you choose not to accept cookies, some TDBFG websites may not function properly or optimally.

Also, if you adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies, you may still receive some online advertising from us.
Spotlight Tags
Spotlight tags help us to manage some of our online advertising and report on activities that happen after a web user sees or clicks on one of our online ads.
The spotlight tag enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.
Ad Management Partners
We use ad management partners, 24/7 Real Media, Inc. and Doubleclick to assist us with delivery and monitoring of our advertising.
For more privacy information about our partners and their opt out policies go to:

DoubleClick, www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.
==========
Online Authentication Process
When you purchase a new product online or register for a secure online service the application you complete includes an online authentication process.
The online authentication process utilizes a third party information service to confirm your identity.
The information that you provide in your application will be compared against the information contained in your consumer credit report, for the sole purpose of validating your identity and will not affect your credit rating or credit file.
The online authentication process also uses Flash cookies, JavaScript and 1 x 1 pixel images to identify the device you are using to access our site.
This is used in combination with the consumer credit report comparison to protect both you and the Bank from fraud.
==========
Responding to surveys online
When you submit your response online to a survey question, we learn your answer or any opinions or information that you volunteer.
For a survey, we may publish results in aggregate on our websites.
