Web Site Navigational Information
Salesforce.com uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons,
to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web sites (“Web Site Navigational Information”)
 .
This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information the Company may collect
and how the Company may use this information.
Cookies
Salesforce.com uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and
meaningful.
When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, salesforce.com’s servers send a cookie
to your computer.
==========
Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you.
They merely recognize
your Web browser.
Unless you choose to identify yourself to salesforce.com, either by responding to
a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30
Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.
==========
There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based.
Session cookies exist
only during one session.
They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or
turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or
turn off your computer.
==========
If you have chosen to identify yourself to salesforce.com, the Company uses session cookies
containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you.
Each time you log
into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your
account is placed your browser.
These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you
when you are logged into the Service and to process your online transactions and requests.
Session
cookies are required to use the Service.
Salesforce.com uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify
browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web sites.
When you purchase the Service or
provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you.
This unique
identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser.
The
Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in
persistent cookies.
==========
For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in
persistent cookies.
If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able
to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Service.
Salesforce.com may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with
Data About salesforce.com Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the
Service.
Web Beacons
Salesforce.com uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information
about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the
Company.
Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on
your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a
description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon.
==========
For example, salesforce.com may place Web beacons
in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you
to one of the Company’s Web sites.
Salesforce.com uses Web beacons to operate and improve the
Company’s Web sites and email communications.
Salesforce.com may use information from Web beacons
in combination with Data About salesforce.com Customers to provide you with information about the
Company and the Service.
IP Addresses

part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.

provided in the salesforce.com Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law.

Customers are responsible for maintaining the security and
confidentiality of their salesforce.com usernames and passwords.
10.
==========
Security
Salesforce.com uses robust security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access,
maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of Customer Data.
When the Service is
accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari
version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology protects Customer Data using both
server authentication and data encryption.
==========
These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is
safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom
the Customer has granted access.
Salesforce.com also implements an advanced security method based
on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a
secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference
or access from outside intruders.
Salesforce.com also offers enhanced security features within the
Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.
Because the Company uses the Service to maintain Data About salesforce.com Customers, this
information is secured in the same manner as described above for Customer Data.
11.
