LoopNet allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service.
With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them.

When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria.
This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria.
