Rubicon Project Desktop Ad Platform Privacy Policy
Last Updated: July 1, 2013
This privacy policy governs the Rubicon Project’s (“Rubicon”) collection and use of data on partner websites that use Rubicon’s ad platform for desktop ads.
This privacy policy does not cover the information collection and use practices on the Rubicon Project website at www.rubiconproject.com.
The information collection and practices relating to our website can be found here.
==========
Data We Collect
Rubicon does not collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) with its ad platform.
When visitors come to a website of a publisher partner using Rubicon’s ad platform, Rubicon may collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”), including the data described below.
Non-PII collected includes, for example, the following:
IP address, domain, browser type and language, referring website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search keywords, visitor activities and actions on publisher’s sites, browser history, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation (city, country, and zip code), click data, types of advertisements viewed, and information about visitor’s device including device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type.
Non-PII is collected using the following standard web technologies:
“Tags and Pixels” are blocks of code that we use to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, and browsing behavior.
For example, we use ad tags on publisher partner sites to tell when a visitor has interacted with ads.
We use pixels to coordinate Non-PII data with publishers, advertisers, and other partners.
“Cookies” are data files, which often include an anonymous unique identifier, sent to a visitor’s browser cookie directory from a website.
Cookies can only be read by the party placing the cookie.
We use cookies on our publisher partners’ websites in the context of collecting Non-PII, we do not use cookies in connection with personally identifiable information.
For more information about cookies visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.

Collectively these technologies enable us to better understand and segment our customers’ audiences.
How We Use The Information
Our core business services rely on collecting Non-PII in order to better match advertiser campaigns to appropriate visitors of our publisher partner sites.
Our other uses of Non-PII may include for example to:

Operate and improve our ad platform;
Create profiles and infer demographic and interest based information about non-personally identified users, and to place each user into segments that are targetable in our ad platform;
Enable standard advertising controls;
Deliver targeted advertisements that we or our partners believe will be of most interest to visitors;
Prepare reports that summarize visitor activity;
Report on ad performance, campaign reporting, and campaign forecasting;
Determine non-personally identified user response to advertisements and promotions; and
Protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.
Rubicon at times may also use Non-PII data from third parties to better match advertiser campaigns to appropriate visitors.
This benefits visitors by enabling advertisers to deliver ad content that is relevant to a visitor’s interests.
Sharing Your Information
Rubicon shares Non-PII information with others for a variety of reasons.
For example:

We share Non-PII with our partners to help them deliver targeted advertisements and to help partners evaluate whether a particular ad campaign is appropriate for you.
We may share Non-PII for the purposes of a business deal (or negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets.
Business deals may include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.

Our advertiser or publisher partners maintain their own privacy policies and processes.
