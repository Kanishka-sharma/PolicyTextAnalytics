An exception is that you are not charged for voice calls that are not completed.

Charges for most Services are incurred in one-minute increments, with partial minutes of use rounded up to the next highest minute.

PCS Vision (Third Generation) Wireless Charges.
For PCS Vision wireless services, you will be charged on a per kilobyte 					basis for data used, rather than for airtime used.

==========
You are responsible for all data activity from and directed to your PCS Phone, 					regardless of who initiates the activity.

==========

If you use a Premium Service 					(including services provided by third parties but for which you are billed on your PCS Invoice), you will be charged for data used in 					transport and routing in addition to the charge for the Premium Service.
The amount of data used and charged to you will vary widely, 					depending upon the specific PCS Vision wireless application or other service you use, the amount of data used in the specific application or 					service, and network congestion and other matters.
For this and other reasons, estimates of data usage - for example, the size of 					downloadable files - will vary from what you actually use.
You cannot receive incoming calls while using third generation services.
==========
Data 					usage will be rounded up to the next whole kilobyte.
Kilobyte usage will be rounded up to the next full cent.

Rounding up will occur at the 					end of each separate session or each clock hour (at the top of each hour), if the session spans more than 1 clock hour.
When traveling on our 					PCS Vision network, a session may be ended and new session initiated, although no interruption to the actual data session will occur.
Your 					invoice will not separately identify the number of kilobytes attributable to your use of specific sites, sessions or services used.
==========
PCS Vision Premium Services.
Your PCS Vision wireless services may allow you to access or download premium content for an additional charge.
Certain PCS Vision services (e.g., games, ringers and screen savers) primarily contain premium services content.
==========
Access to and downloading of premium content is not included with PCS Vision services.
The additional charges for this premium content will be billed to you on your PCS Invoice.
You will be charged for this content (at rates and charges specified at the time of access or download) that will be in addition to data usage charges you will incur while connected to the enhanced PCS Vision network.
We provide no warranties and make no representations or claims with regard to third-party Premium Services.

==========
We may limit the amount of Premium Services you may purchase in a specific timeframe (month, week, day, or other time period).
We may suspend your use of Premium Services without prior consent or notice if we have reason to suspect fraudulent or unauthorized use of your Premium Services account, but we make no assurances that we will suspend your account.
==========
Other Terms Applicable to PCS Vision Usage.
Use of PCS Vision wireless services requires the purchase of a separate third 					generation wireless compatible phone or other device and is subject to any software, memory, storage or other limitation in the phone or 					other equipment.

PCS Vision services are not available for server devices or host computer applications, other 					systems that drive continuous heavy traffic or data sessions, or as substitutes for private lines or frame relay connections.
Unlimited PCS 					Vision plans/options are only available with phones or PCS smart phones where the device is not being used as a modem in connection with 					other equipment (e.g., computers, PDAs, etc.) through use of connection kits or other phone-to-computer/PDA accessories, or Bluetooth or 					other wireless technology.
==========
Sprint reserves the right to deny or to terminate service without notice for any misuse.
Sprint is not 					responsible for any opinions, advice, statements, services applications or other information provided by third parties and accessible through 					PCS Vision wireless services.
Neither Sprint nor its vendors or licensors guarantees the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of information 					that is obtained through the PCS Vision wireless services.
You are responsible for evaluating such content.
==========
Use of certain PCS Vision 					wireless services, including some messaging services, may result in the disclosure to others of your email address and other information 					about you in connection with your internet usage.

Voice Command.
PCS Voice Command is an optional service that allows you to place calls by using speech recognition technology.
Calls to 911 or similar emergency numbers cannot be placed through the Voice Command feature.
==========
Airtime and applicable long distance charges for a call completed from your Number using the Voice Command feature begin when you press or activate the TALK or similar key(s) and end when your call is terminated by hitting the END key or by returning to the Voice Command platform.
If you initiate and complete another call without leaving the Voice Command platform, a separate charge for that call will begin from the time the previous call was terminated.
Airtime and applicable long distance charges will be applied to the entire length of a completed call initiated from Voice Command.
Using Directory Assistance to input names into your Voice Command address book will incur additional charges.
==========
Invoicing.
Invoicing cycles are approximately 30 days in length.
==========
Invoicing cycles and dates may change from time to time.
Except as otherwise provided in your Service Plan, monthly recurring charges (MRCs) are invoiced one invoicing cycle in advance.
==========
Charges for Services are usually invoiced as soon as possible after the charges accrue.
We may, however, invoice you for usage and charges occurring before the invoicing cycle being invoiced, if they were not previously invoiced.
If you are invoiced for usage incurred during a prior invoicing cycle, those minutes will be applied to your Service Plan minutes for the current invoicing cycle.
However, if you change your PCS Service Plan between the time the usage was incurred and the beginning of the current invoicing cycle, those minutes from the prior invoicing cycle will be charged at the rate per minute for usage over included minutes provided in the Service Plan in effect at the time the usage was incurred.
==========
Payment.
If you have authorized payment for Services or equipment by credit card or by debiting a bank account, no additional notice or consent is required before we invoice the credit card or debit the bank account for all amounts due to us or billed by us on behalf of a third party.
You must promptly notify us of any change in your invoicing address or of the credit card or bank account used for payment.
We reserve the right to require payment by money order, cashier's check or other secured form of payment.
If we take action to receive payment beyond invoicing you for charges for Services or equipment, you must pay our costs and expenses of collection, including attorneys' fees and expenses, the fees of any collection agency and court costs.
==========
If we act as an invoicing agent for a third-party service provider, payments received are first applied to amounts due and owing to us and any remaining amounts are applied to sums due and owing to the third-party service provider.
We may immediately charge an additional fee for any check or other negotiable instrument endorsed by you and returned unpaid by a financial institution for any reason.
You may be charged fees for certain methods of payment.
Late Payment Charges.
Payment is past due if we do not receive it by the due date shown on your invoice.
Any payment for Services and equipment not made when due accrues late charges until paid at the rate of 5% per month or at the highest rate allowed by law.
Acceptance of late or partial payments (even if marked "paid in full") does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe us.
If your Service has been suspended due to non-payment, you may be charged a reactivation fee.
==========
Disputed Charges.
You must raise any dispute that you have about any charges invoiced to you within 15 days of the date of the invoice or you have accepted the invoice.
==========
You may notify us of any dispute by notifying PCS Customer Service Solutions.
Calls to our sales or general business offices are not notice of a dispute.
If disputed invoice procedures are described on the invoice, you must follow them.
==========
Account Spending Limit.
If we agree to provide Services to you on an Account Spending Limit basis, we will tell you your Account Spending Limit before we start Services to your Number, or as reasonably practicable after the limit is imposed.
If we require a deposit for you to establish or keep Services on an Account Spending Limit basis, we will hold the deposit as partial guarantee of payment for Services (see Deposits).
Charges for Services accrue against your Account Spending Limit as they are incurred.
==========
We may charge an initial ASL start up fee.
We may charge a monthly ASL service fee, in addition to your recurring monthly service charge.
==========
We may suspend Services to your Number without prior notice to you when your account balance reaches your Account Spending Limit.
Services are restored when you have paid any past due balance and pay a specified minimum amount to reduce your account balance below your Account Spending Limit.

==========
Clear Pay.
If we agree to provide Services to you as a Clear Pay customer, we may suspend Services to your Number without prior notice to you immediately when your bill becomes past due.
Even if your bill is not past due, we may suspend services if your unpaid usage exceeds $125 or another amount to be determined by your past credit or usage history.

A deposit may not be used to pay any invoice (unless it is used to pay a final invoice) or delay payment.
The deposit amount, the length of time we hold the deposit and changes to the deposit amount are determined based on your credit and payment history.
==========
The rate of interest, if any, on the deposit is subject to change.
We may mix deposits with our other funds.
==========
If Services are terminated for any reason, we may, without notice to you, apply your deposit toward payment of outstanding charges and return any excess to you at your last known address within 75 days after termination of Services.
If the U.S. Postal Service cannot deliver the money to you and returns it to us, we will hold it for you for one year from the date of return and, during that period, we may charge a servicing fee against the deposit balance.
==========
Any money held during this one-year period will not accrue interest for your benefit.
You forfeit any portion of the money left after the one-year period.
==========
Wireless Web and Voice Portal Services.
Wireless Web Services are part of the Services that can be obtained through Sprint.
Wireless Web Services are not available in all markets or while roaming off the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network.
==========
Use of Wireless Web Services requires an Internet-ready PCS Phone or certain other equipment (or both) and is subject to any memory, storage or other limitation in the phone or other equipment.
Wireless Web Services are not available on PCS Vision phones or devices.
The Caller ID blocking feature is not available when using Wireless Web Services.
Any use of Wireless Web Services deducts from your Service Plan minutes.
==========
For data calls (including Wireless Web and Voice Portal calls) that are attempted, but not completed, you are charged for the time during which the network attempts to connect the call.
You are charged for time spent connected to the Wireless Web or Voice Portal, including time spent browsing on the Internet or Voice Portal and reviewing or scrolling through Internet information on-line while still connected to the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network.
Not all Internet sites can be accessed and you may receive an error message if you attempt to access a site that cannot be accessed through Wireless Web Services.
You are also charged for Wireless Web connections to review your PCS account information.
Wireless Web Services are not available with all Service Plans.
Sprint is not responsible for any opinions, advice, statements, services or other information provided by third-parties and accessible through Wireless Web Services or Voice Portal Services.
Neither Sprint nor its vendors or licensors guarantees the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of information that is obtained through the Wireless Web Services or Voice Portal Services.
You are responsible for evaluating such content.
==========
Taxes and Surcharges.
We invoice you for taxes, fees and other charges levied by or remitted directly to federal, state or local authorities, or foreign government on Services including, without limitation, sales, gross receipts, use, and excise taxes.
==========
If you claim any tax exemption, you must provide us with a valid tax-exempt document.
Any tax exemption applies only from the date we receive a valid tax-exempt document.
==========
We also invoice you for fees that we collect and remit to the government such as Universal Service, and for surcharges that we collect and keep to pay for the costs of complying with government mandates such as number pooling and portability, and Enhanced 911 service.
These charges are neither taxes nor government imposed assessments.
==========
Roaming.
Calls made while off the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network are "roaming" calls.
Your PCS Phone is specifically designed and engineered to work only on the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network.
==========
It works on another CDMA PCS provider's system only when a roaming agreement is in place between Sprint and the other providers.
If your PCS Phone is a dual-mode phone, it works on both a CDMA PCS provider's system (in addition to the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network) and a wireless analog telecommunications provider's system only when roaming agreements are in place between Sprint and the other providers.
If we do not have a roaming agreement in place, you may be able to place roaming calls "manually" by using a valid credit card.
If there is a gap or other interruption of coverage within a PCS coverage area that prevents connection with the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network and your dual-band phone is set to roam automatically when outside PCS coverage, you may incur roaming fees within a PCS coverage area.
Certain features and services may not be available when roaming (including PCS Vision, voicemail, call waiting, call forwarding, etc.).
==========
Phones and Other Equipment.
Phones and other equipment may be purchased and returned as provided in the purchase documents.
We are not the manufacturer of the phones or other equipment.
The only warranties on the phones or other equipment are any limited warranties extended by the manufacturers.
We have no liability in connection with the phones and other equipment or for the manufacturers' acts or omissions.
Lost or Stolen Equipment.
If your phone or other equipment is lost or stolen, you must notify us by calling PCS Customer Service Solutions.
You are responsible for all charges for Services provided to the Number for the lost or stolen equipment before you notify us of the loss or theft.
We will deactivate Services to the Number upon notification to us of any loss or theft.
You may be required to provide evidence of the loss or theft (for example, a police report or sworn statement).
If the equipment is later found, we may require that you exchange it for another phone or other equipment before we reactivate Services (if we do reactivate Services), as well as require you to pay a reactivation fee.
==========
We will deactivate Services to any Number without prior notice to you if we suspect any unlawful or fraudulent use of the Number.
You agree to cooperate reasonably with us in investigating suspected unlawful or fraudulent use.
==========
Messages.
You will incur airtime usage charges when accessing your voicemail from your PCS Phone.
You may also incur charges in accessing text messages from your PCS Phone.
You may access your voicemail without incurring airtime usage charges by checking your voicemail from a wireline phone.
We may impose limits on the number of voicemail or text message that can be retained through your PCS account.
Audible or visual indicators of text or voicemail messages, including mailbox icons on your PCS Phone, may not always provide an up to date indication of new messages.
In certain instances, you may be required to manually reset or clear your mailbox indicator.
==========
Caller ID.
If you do not want people you call to receive the Number assigned to your phone, you must call PCS Customer Service Solutions for information about automatic Caller ID blocking.
The Number assigned to your phone can be blocked on a per-call basis by dialing *67 + Destination Number + TALK (or similar key), but Caller ID delivery resumes on the next call you make.
Caller ID display on incoming calls to your Number depends on receiving the information from the calling party.
==========
TTY Access.
A TTY (also known as TDD or Text Telephone) is a telecommunications device that allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who have speech or language disabilities, to communicate by telephone.
TTY doesn't work with all PCS Phones.
==========
If you have a PCS TTY-capable phone, it may not function effectively, or at all, when attempting 911 calls due to the equipment or software of the answering agency.
Therefore, a TTY device should not be relied on for 911 calls.
==========
Pay-Per-Call Service.
We will not complete calls from your Number to 900, 976 and similar numbers for pay-per-call services.
==========
International Calling.
You may be limited in the international destinations that you can call with Services.
You should contact PCS Customer Service Solutions for information about international destinations that you cannot call.
==========
Limitation of Liability.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, our sole liability to you for any loss or damage arising out of providing or failing to provide Services (including mistakes, omissions, interruptions, delays, errors, or defects) does not exceed (1) in cases related to a specific piece of equipment, the prorated MRC for Services to the piece of equipment during the affected period, or (2) in cases not related to a specific piece of equipment, the prorated MRCs for Services to you during the affected period.

any act or omission of any third party or independent contractor that offers products or services in conjunction with or through the Services; or
your negligent or intentional act or omission.

NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES, PHONES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

==========
The arbitrator's decision and award will be final and binding (subject to the appeal clause below), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
An appeal may be taken under the CPR Arbitration Appeal Procedure from any final award of any arbitral panel in any arbitration arising out of or related to this agreement that is conducted in accordance with the requirements of such Appeal Procedure.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the appeal tribunal, the appeal shall be conducted at the place of the original arbitration.
If any party files a judicial or administrative action asserting a claim that is subject to arbitration and another party successfully stays such action or compels arbitration, the party filing that action must pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including attorney's fees.

==========
This Agreement is subject to any applicable federal and state law (collectively, "Applicable Laws").

You agree to indemnify and hold Sprint, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, harmless from any claim, demand, or damage, including reasonable attorneys' fees, asserted by any third party due to or arising out of your use of or conduct on the Service.
==========
No spam; damages.
Sprint will immediately terminate any account which it believes, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk email.
In addition, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then you agree to pay Sprint liquidated damages of $5 for each piece of spam or unsolicited bulk email transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account, otherwise you agree to pay Sprint's actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
==========
Participation in promotions of advertisers.
Any dealings with Advertisers on the Service or participation in promotions, including the delivery of and the payment for goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between you and the Advertiser or other third party.
Sprint shall not be responsible or liable for any part of any such dealings or promotions.
