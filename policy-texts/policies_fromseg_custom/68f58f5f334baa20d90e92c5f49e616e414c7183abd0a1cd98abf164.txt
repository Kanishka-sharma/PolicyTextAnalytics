Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information of European Economic Area (“EEA”)
Individuals: On certain occasions, PilotX.tv relies on the consent of the individual to process personal information, such as, when the user enters personal information into the PilotX.tv website.
On other instances, PilotX.tv may process personal information when PilotX.tv needs to do this to fulfill a contract or where PilotX.tv is required to do so by law.
PilotX.tv may also process data when it is in PilotX.tv’ or its customer’s legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights (which may vary based on an individual’s jurisdiction).
Those legitimate interests include improving PilotX.tv’ Services.
==========
Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out
Blue Water Ads adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles in the US and to the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Principles in the European Union (“EU”) and the IAB Europe OBA Framework.
As previously mentioned, the PilotX.tv platform uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies to give Publishers the possibility to offer, and platform advertisers the ability to show, targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a different device.
These ads are more likely to be relevant to you as they are based on interests drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use data collected across non-affiliated apps over time.
This is considered “interest-driven advertising.”
In addition, certain third parties may collect information on the PilotX.tv website and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include interest-driven advertising.
==========

Please note that in order for your opt-out choice to be effective using this tool, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the PilotX.tv opt-out cookie.
