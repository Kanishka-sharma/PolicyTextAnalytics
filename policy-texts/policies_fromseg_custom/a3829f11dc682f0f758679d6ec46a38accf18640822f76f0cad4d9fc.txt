Information About Visiting Our Websites
We may collect information about your computer and your visits to our websites such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of pageviews.
==========
We may use this information in the administration of our websites, to improve their usability, and for marketing purposes.
We use cookies on our websites.
A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser.
The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
We may send a cookie which may be stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive.
==========
We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of our websites, to improve their usability and for marketing purposes.
We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our websites, and to personalize our websites for you.
We may use anonymous cookies to record non-personal information such as website activity, date and time of visit, and domain type.
We may use this information for retargeting purposes.
For some of the ads served on our websites, Google uses a DoubleClick DART cookie to identify your past browsing history and then serve you relevant ads on any of their advertising partner websites.
You can opt out of this kind of cookie tracking by using the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out Tool.
Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies overall and for specific websites.
This can, however, impact the usability of many websites, including any of ours.

Personal data submitted on our websites will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website in question.

Improve your browsing experience by personalizing our websites
Send information (other than marketing communications) to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email or similar technology
Using Your Non-Personal Data
We use your non-personal and anonymous data in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:
Advertising Services
Non-personal data is collected and shared with the service AdRoll to provide relevant and targeted advertisements through retargeting.
All data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify the visitor.
==========
Retargeting recognizes that the internet browser has visited any of our websites in the last 90 days.
If you don’t want to participate in retargeting, you may opt-out of AdRoll’s services.
Broadband Performance Data Services
The information we collect via the broadband and mobile performance tests run on either speedtest.net or pingtest.net is done so anonymously and is then aggregated for a few different broadband performance data services.
We do so with the express intent of providing a neutral and unbiased monitoring and reporting resource for organizations around the world.
This anonymous, aggregated data can be accessed via subscription services or via our publicly-available data repository, NetIndex.

In connection with a merger, acquisition or other sale of significant assets of our company, we may transfer all of our data regarding broadband performance, including individual broadband test results, to the acquiring company.
We commit to first get their binding assurance that they also abide by all privacy laws and generally accepted privacy policies.
