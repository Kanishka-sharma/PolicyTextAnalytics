Foursquare Labs, Inc. ("Foursquare") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.
Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
By visiting or using the Foursquare website, Foursquare's services and applications, and any other linked pages, features, or content offered from time to time by Foursquare in connection therewith (collectively, the "Service"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
This Privacy Policy covers Foursquare's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Foursquare gathers when you are accessing Foursquare's Service.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Foursquare does not own or control, or to individuals that Foursquare does not employ or manage.
==========
In addition, the Service contains links to outside sources, both ones we have added ourselves and ones that members have submitted.
While we attempt to provide links only to those sites that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites.
We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any web sites you visit.
==========
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES FOURSQUARE COLLECT?
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service.
In connection with the Service, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of the Service, which allows users to identify each other.
==========
We collect the following types of information from our customers.
Personal Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way.
The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, user name, address, email address, phone number, IP address, use information and browser information.
==========
The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to interact with other users, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.
We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network, and to develop new tools for the community.
Personal Information Collected Automatically:
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Service or services.
Foursquare automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.
==========
Foursquare only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.
This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Service or services so that we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services.
As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site.
We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.
Again, Foursquare never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
==========
Email Communications:
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Foursquare if your computer supports this type of program.
Foursquare uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service.
If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process, by making a modification on your account settings page.
==========
What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.
Foursquare cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Service's most attractive features.
==========
Ads appearing on the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies.
These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Foursquare and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
==========
SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER USERS
Information you submit to the Service will be available to users of the Service who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).
Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Service network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines.
This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request.
People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your information unless they have a relationship to you (friends etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.
Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information in community, messaging or other on-line discussions, that information is governed by the privacy settings of that particular Foursquare group and may be available to the general Foursquare membership.
==========
Individuals reading this information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without your knowledge.
Therefore, when using discussion groups, sending messages or participating in other on-line discussions, we urge you to think carefully about including any specific information (medical or otherwise) that might be used to identify you or your family members.

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.
==========

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Foursquare may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
Protection of Foursquare and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Foursquare, our employees, our users, or others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
==========
IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?
Your Foursquare account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
