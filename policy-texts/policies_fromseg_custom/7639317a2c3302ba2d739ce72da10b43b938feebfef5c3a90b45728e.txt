Microsoft Online Privacy Statement
(last updated: January 2006)
Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy.
Please read the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement below and also any supplemental information listed to the right for additional details about particular Microsoft sites and services that you may use.
This Microsoft Online Privacy Statement applies to data collected by Microsoft through the majority of its Web sites and services, as well as its offline product support services.
It does not apply to those Microsoft sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.
==========
Collection of Your Personal Information
In order to access some Microsoft services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your credentials.
In most cases, these credentials will be part of the Microsoft Passport Network, which means you can use the same credentials to sign in to many different Microsoft sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners.
By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically signed into other Microsoft sites and services.
If you access our services via a mobile phone, you may also use your telephone number and a PIN as an alternative credential to your username and password.
As part of creating your credentials, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as well as an alternate email address.
Some services may require added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key.
Finally, a unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials which will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.
At some Microsoft sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number.
We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.
If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, that is used to create a Microsoft billing account.
==========
We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with Microsoft sites and services.
We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.
When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Microsoft, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.
==========
In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Microsoft, information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information obtained through other Microsoft services.
We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies.
==========
For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.
Use of Your Personal Information
Microsoft collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested.
These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.
==========
We also use your personal information to communicate with you.
We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements.
==========
Some Microsoft services, such as MSN Hotmail, may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service.
We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft and its affiliates.
Personal information collected on Microsoft sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a Microsoft site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
==========
Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
Sharing of Your Personal Information
Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent.
Some Microsoft sites allow you to choose to share your personal information with select Microsoft partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers.
Other sites, such as MSN, do not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes, but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from Microsoft on behalf of external business partners about a partner's particular offering (without transferring your personal information to the third party).
See the Communication Preferences section below for more information.
==========
Some Microsoft services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company.
If you register for or use such services, both Microsoft and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
==========
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services.
Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service.
They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
==========
We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Microsoft; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft services or members of the public.

Security of Your Personal Information
Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.
==========
When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.
Do not share this information with anyone.
If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
==========
Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information
Many Microsoft sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
When a Microsoft site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information.
We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.
Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use Microsoft services, this will include such general audience communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages.
Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children's personal information.
For example, on MSN and Windows Live, parents can visit Account Services, and click on �Permission for kids.
If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent.
