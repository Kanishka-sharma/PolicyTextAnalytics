About ROBLOX

                        ROBLOX Corporation (“ROBLOX”) is an online virtual world and building game.
Your
                        privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of
                        what information is collected, how we use it and who we share it with.
Our offices are located at
                        60 East Third Avenue, suite 201 in San Mateo, California, 94401.
This privacy policy covers the site www.roblox.com.
ROBLOX works like this:
                        

                        • a user creates a virtual character, that is his or her identity in the ROBLOX
                        world
                        
                        • users interact with other users through in-game chat, personal messaging (site
                        contained), and user forums; privacy settings allow users or parents to restrict
                        communications with other users
                        
                        • each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can
                        build houses, cars, machines, or anything else you can build with building blocks;
                        these places are called “games”
                        
                        • users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games
                        with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their virtual
                        character name
                        
                        • users earn tickets and/or ROBUX, our virtual currency; users earn these in a variety
                        of ways, and use them to buy items for their characters, including virtual hats,
                        shirts, and pants; users can also sell these items, earning tickets and/or ROBUX
                        
                        • users can purchase premium services, including: Builder’s Club, a monthly subscription
                        that grants the user more virtual places and a daily allowance, among other things;
                        and, ROBUX currency, allowing users to buy virtual currency that can in turn be
                        used to buy virtual goods
                        • users may  sign up to receive our monthly newsletter which they may opt-out of at any time by
                         following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication.
==========
Requested Information

                        ROBLOX users may play as guests; in this mode, users remain anonymous and interact
                        with the website and game in Menu Chat Mode – no free chat, no personal messaging
                        to or from users, no posting to the forums, and other restrictions designed to prevent
                        users from sharing personal information, intentional or otherwise.
As guests, users
                        are unable to save play statistics, accumulate points, share models, or participate
                        in our virtual economy.
Users wishing to save statistics, share models, and participate in the economy are
                        required to enter a username and password.
We advise users to create a username
                        that does not reflect their own name nor reveal personally identifiable information.
We also advise users to pick a password that is not easy to guess, and to not share
                        that password.
For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form.
==========
Registered users who are under 13 initially play in Menu Chat Mode.
To opt-in to
                        filtered free chat communications, users are required to provide and verify a parent’s
                        email address.
We use this information to inform parents that their child has signed
                        up to use our service; we also use this information to obtain permission from parents
                        for their child to participate in certain activities.
The verification email we send
                        informs parents of their child’s registration with ROBLOX.
Under-13 users who do not 
                        enter a parent’s email address or who fail to verify one remain in Privacy Mode.
Registered users who are 13 or older can opt-in to Privacy Mode, but begin with it turned
                        off.
==========
Regardless of security and privacy settings, all text on the site is filtered proactively
                        to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, age, and other personally
                        identifiable information.
All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and
                        adult or suggestive content.
Our system is a combination human and automated processes;
                        like all filtering technology, our processes are not 100% effective.
==========
Users wishing to purchase Builders Club or ROBUX are required to enter billing
                        information, including name, billing address, credit card or PayPal number, and
                        billing email.
For children under 13, we request the parent’s billing information.
Billing information is retained to support customer service inquiries, but we do
                        not retain the full credit card number.
==========
If you (or your child) choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about
                        our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.
We will automatically
                        send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site; ROBLOX
                        does not store this information.
If your child opts-in to receiving our monthly newsletter we will send you a notice (to the
                         email address your child provides for you) in order to allow you to opt them out of receiving 
                         it if you wish to do so.
We will collect your child’s email address for the sole purpose of 
                         sending them the newsletter.
You may opt your child out at any time by clicking the opt-out 
                         link in the newsletter verification email.
We do not collect any Personal Information from children, only username and password.
We do 
                        not ask for or  collect from a child under 13 personally identifiable information that is not
                         reasonably necessary for that child to participate in any given activity online.
==========
Collected Information

                        ROBLOX uses a software technology called “cookies.”
Cookies are small text files
                        that we place in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences.
These cookies
                        do not store personally identifiable information.
For account security purposes,
                        we may store a cookie that contains the encrypted user password; the original password
                        cannot be recovered by hackers.
Users who disable cookies in their browsers will
                        not be able to logon to the ROBLOX website or play the ROBLOX game.
We also use cookies and “clear gifs” (on-page tracking code) to track user entry
                        onto and movement within the ROBLOX website.
This helps us credit advertisers appropriately,
                        and measure the health and effectiveness of our website.
For example, we use tracking
                        to determine if new page designs are user friendly or too complicated.
Our tracking
                        approach is industry standard, and includes non-personally identifiable information
                        such as IP address, browser type, and date/time.
Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally
                        identifiable “computer” information, such as the type of computer operating system
                        (e.g., Windows 95 or Mac OS), the web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer)
                        being used, IP address, and information regarding the Internet service provider.
==========
This information is used to provide technical and community support.
We also collect performance data from within ROBLOX Studio or the ROBLOX Player.
We use this data retrospectively to improve the user experience of our games.
This
                        information includes in-game networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage,
                        among other relevant data.
==========
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.
We have
                        no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use
                        of cookies by ROBLOX (www.roblox.com) only and does not cover the use of cookies
                        by any advertisers.
==========
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.
These
                        companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address
                        or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
                        advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
If you would like more information
                        about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these
                        companies, click here
                         or http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.
==========
Information Sharing

                        We pass user billing information on to our transaction processing partners.
This is done 
                        for non-anonymous payment types, including credit card, Pay by Phone, and PayPal payments.
For recurring monthly transactions, PayPal retains the credit card authorization on file, 
                        but we do not.
==========
We share aggregate web activity data, such as page views and unique visitor counts,
                        with our advertising partners.
No personally identifiable information is shared.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required
                        by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or
                        comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web
                        site.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personally identifiable
                        information in response to a law enforcement agencies or other public agencies (including
                        schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent
                        the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety
                        or protect the safety of a child using our website, protect the security or integrity
                        of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability.
We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are
                        materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental
                        notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different
                        uses.
Parents have the right to consent to the site’s use of their child’s personal information without
                        having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties as we do not share
                        children’s information with third parties.
==========
Security & Privacy

                        The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive
                        information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we
                        encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
                        submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission
                        over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore,
                        while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information,
                        we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
==========
If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be
                        aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,
                        collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you
                        unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information
                        you choose to submit in these forums.
Options for Parents
                    

                        If a child enters a parent’s email address during signup, the parent receives
                        an email notification of the account creation and an invitation to areview chat and 
                        privacy settings for that account.
A parent receiving a verification email has two options.
==========
First, the parent can
                        choose not to respond; in this case, the child remains in Menu Chat Mode.
Second,
                        the parent can choose to click the link in the email and  review the settings; in this 
                        case, the child may be opted-in to free (but filtered) text communications,  including
                        free-text chat and personal messaging (site limited), forum posts, and site commentary.
A child can send a email request to their parent to change the settings at any time.
Parents can close a child’s account by contacting ROBLOX customer service (see below).
This hides the account from all other ROBLOX users and outside parties.
==========
The account
                        data is not deleted, but retained internally for three purposes.
Billing information
                        and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and
                        inquiries.
Public domain content is retained for use by the community – e.g. a virtual
                        shirt sold by the child to another user is kept in the system because the recipient
                        now “owns” a copy of that article.
Finally, user account history is retained to
                        support subsequent customer service inquiries.
All retained data for a closed account
                        is private and visible only to employees.
==========
We may store the date of birth of your child and graduate a player to have more Web site 
                        access once they turn 13.
We will notify the parent once their child has reached 13 and 
                        may prompt the child to then provide us with their email address the next time they sign 
                        into their account.
If your child opts-in to receive our monthly newsletter we will send 
                        you a notice (to the email address your child provides for you).
We will only collect your 
                        child’s email address for the sole purpose of sending them the newsletter.
==========
