AARP Understands How Important Privacy Is to Our Members
We are committed to protecting your privacy and want to make sure that you understand how your membership information is used.
We also want you to be aware that you have choices about how we use this information.
What Information We Collect
When you apply for membership, we ask for basic information such as your name, contact information, and date of birth.
==========
We keep track of your participation in AARP activities and member services so we can understand our members' interests and evaluate the effectiveness of our offerings.
We also collect demographic information from other sources to help us learn more about member characteristics and needs.
==========
As explained in the Questions and Answers below, we may ask for additional information in your visits to AARP.org.
All of this information helps us better serve our members and improve our programs.
==========
Information Sharing
We share your personal information only with companies we have selected to provide official AARP member services or support AARP operations.
Some of the providers of AARP member services, including many of those listed on our Products and Services area, pay a fee for access to our membership list.
Our contracts with these companies require them to keep the member information strictly confidential, and allow them to use the information only to offer the contracted services to AARP and AARP members.
==========
We oversee the companies' compliance through our wholly owned subsidiary, AARP Services, Inc.
Other AARP affiliates, such as the AARP Foundation, may also have access to member information.
Finally, we may release personal member information on the rare occasions when we are required to do so by law, or when necessary or appropriate to comply with legal process or to protect or defend AARP and its members.
We do not sell or rent member information to telemarketers, mailing list brokers, or any other companies that are not offering AARP-endorsed services or benefits.
==========
Your Choices
We respect your choices.
If you do not want us to share your information with providers of AARP member services, you can contact us as specified below.
You should then stop receiving AARP service provider mailings in about 14 weeks.
(Note: If you request services or information from an AARP service provider directly, we may still need to confirm to the provider that you are an eligible AARP member).
You may also elect not to receive information about AARP activities, such as legislative events and educational programs, or about the activities of other AARP affiliates like the AARP Foundation.
