At any point that you interact with us, you may be given the opportunity to opt in to receive Harrods marketing communications.
We will only send you marketing communications when you have consented to receive them, and we will do so using your preferred channels of communication.
If you have not updated your marketing preferences in two years, we will contact you to remind you that you can opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time:
- In cases where you have not made a purchase with Harrods during this two-year period, we will only continue to send you marketing communications if you expressly tell us to do so.
If you do nothing, then we will stop sending you marketing communications.
- If you have made a purchase with Harrods during this period, we will continue to communicate with you in the same way until you tell us otherwise.
If you do nothing, we will assume that you are happy to continue receiving marketing materials from Harrods in the same way.
==========
If you have opted in to receive marketing communications from us, you can manage your preferences online at any time.
We have created a Preference Centre where you can manage your marketing communications preferences, and tell us what you want to hear about and how you want Harrods to communicate with you.
To manage your preferences for the Harrods Hair and Beauty Salon, please log in to your Hair and Beauty account.
We will send you marketing material that we believe you will be interested in based on your previous spending behaviour.
==========
You may not receive all types of communications that you have chosen to receive.
To understand more about the criteria we use to determine which marketing communications you receive, please contact our Customer Service team.
If you have given us your email address or mobile phone number and agreed to receive marketing communications from us, we may supply this data to digital advertising or social media companies, including Facebook and Google.
==========
These companies work on our behalf to identify individuals with similar characteristics to our customers, and they provide these individuals with advertising content from us.
We may also work with these companies to target or retarget you directly with advertisements that we believe you will be interested in.
==========
The data we provide to these organisations is limited to email address or mobile phone number and is always provided in an encrypted format.
We use your personal data in this manner as it is in our legitimate interest to advertise to potential new customers.
This use of your personal data constitutes profiling.
==========
If you would prefer not to see targeted advertising from us on social media, please refer to the instructions provided by Facebook or Google, or contact our Customer Service team for advice on how to opt out.
Please note: when you visit one of Harrodsâ€™ brand partners in-store or participate in a branded promotion or event, our brand partners may also ask if you want to sign up to receive marketing communications directly from them about their events, products and services.
==========
If you provide your personal details to any of our brand partners, the use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy and cannot be managed through Harrods or the Preference Centre.
Please ask the relevant sales associate for details about their privacy policy and how you can manage your marketing communications preferences with them.
