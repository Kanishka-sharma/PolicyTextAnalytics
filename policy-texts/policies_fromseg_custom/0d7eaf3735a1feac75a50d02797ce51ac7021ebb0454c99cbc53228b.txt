Overview
LiveRamp is a data connectivity platform leveraged by companies, such as brands and their partners, to deliver exceptional experiences.
Our business provides the technology to move data safely and securely between various parties, such as advertisers and the platforms that host ads.
LiveRamp allows companies to enhance and activate their data across online and offline channels, primarily for marketing purposes.
==========
For instance, a sports clothing store might receive email addresses from its in-store shoppers.
This enables the store to send emails to its shoppers regarding offers or updates, but doesn’t enable it to communicate tailored offerings to its shoppers through different channels, or enable the store to understand the effectiveness of its online marketing.
==========
LiveRamp enables the sports clothing store to transform the information provided directly by its customers into other identifiers, such as browser cookies or mobile advertising IDs.
This enables the store to move and use its data much more flexibly, such as serving digital advertisements on their customers’ devices, understanding how those digital advertising campaigns impact in-store sales, or discovering additional customer traits by appending 2nd- and 3rd-party data sets to its customer list.
==========

Though the information in this policy is accurate regardless of where you reside, more specific information and access to some data rights described in geographically-defined regulations, such as California’s CCPA or the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), may be available depending on your jurisdiction.

General Privacy Information and Policies
The following sets forth the categories of information we collect and purposes for which we may use personal information:
Our Collection of Personal Information
LiveRamp collects certain categories of personal information in connection with our products.
==========
For the purposes of this policy, personal information is broadly defined as information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device.
This includes offline identifiers such as a postal address (i.e., directly identifiable data or personally identifiable information (PII)), as well as online identifiers associated with devices (i.e., non-PII), such as a browser cookie or mobile advertising ID.
Cookies are one example of an online identifier: they are small, unique text files stored on the browser of your computer (or another internet-connected device) to identify the device.
==========
Cookies contain information that helps improve site functionality and security, but can also be used for advertising, analytics, and other commercial purposes which span multiple sites.
1st-party cookies are cookies set by the website owner; 3rd-party cookies are cookies set by parties other than the website owner.
In its products, LiveRamp both places 3rd-party cookies and leverages its partners’ 1st-party cookies.
On web browsers LiveRamp may collect and store data using 3rd-party cookies that it places, and in some cases multiple types of identifiers may be collected in the course of a single action.
When you log into one of our partner websites, that partner may share information collected from you, such as your email (in hashed, non-human-readable form), IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with LiveRamp.
LiveRamp uses this information to create an online identification code for the purpose of recognizing you on your device.
This code may be placed in our partners’ cookie and for use in online and cross-channel advertising, or LiveRamp may connect it to LiveRamp’s own 3rd-party cookie.
==========
It may be shared with advertising partners and other third party advertising companies globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content or targeted advertising throughout your online experience (e.g. web, connected TV, mobile applications, etc).
These third parties may in turn use this code to link demographic or interest-based information you have provided in your interactions with them.
==========
You have the right to express a choice regarding LiveRamp using this data for the above purposes.
To opt out of this use, please click here.
==========
Finally, LiveRamp uses certain publicly available data sets in order to enhance and improve our products.
These data sets do not include personal information as defined under any applicable privacy laws.
==========

==========
We likewise may provide information to other companies and organizations (including law enforcement) for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.
Sharing In Event of a Corporate Transaction: We may also share personal information in the event of a major corporate transaction, including for example a merger, investment, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, or sale of some or all of our assets, or for purposes of due diligence connected with any such transaction.
==========
Sharing With Service Providers: We may share personal information with our service providers who process it on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.
Service providers are contractually prohibited from using the personal information for purposes outside of our instruction.
This may include, for instance, providers involved in tech or customer support, operations, web or data hosting, billing, accounting, security, marketing, data management, validation, enhancement or hygiene, or otherwise assisting us to provide, develop, maintain and improve our services.
Our Business Purposes for Collecting and Sharing Personal Information
Generally speaking, we collect and share Personal Information to recognize consumers across different channels and platforms over time for the purposes of facilitating online advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting.
This includes:
Data-driven marketing
For example:
Generally, creating data-driven marketing tools and products for our clients, as described in the initial section of this Privacy Policy and on our websites.
This includes our provision of datasets, including 3rd-party data sets through LiveRamp’s Data Marketplace, data “appends” (connecting data across datasets), and data hygiene services (helping customers to evaluate, validate and correct personal information they hold).
==========
Assisting our clients through our products to provide their current and prospective customers with better service, improved offerings, and special promotions, for instance, advising on which current or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or uninterested) in certain offers.
Creating modelled audiences to which our clients can market their products and services.
==========
For example, as described at the beginning of this policy, a sports clothing company is looking for new potential customers who are likely to be interested in sports clothing.
The sports clothing company can use our services and products to look for shared characteristics between their existing customers and other consumers.
A similar interest can be inferred or anticipated based on these similar characteristics, such as from browsing for sports shoes.
==========
For enabling our clients to associate information they have collected about you with certain identifiers or data to facilitate the delivery of our clients’ marketing and advertisements to you through various media, including mobile apps, social media sites, andConnected TV offerings.
For example, a sports clothing company has its own lists of names, emails, and/or addresses of customers who have previously purchased sports clothing from them.
The sports clothing company wants to reach out to these customers with online advertising for a discount offer on online purchases.
The sports clothing company can use our products and services to convert the company’s lists from PII (e.g. names, emails, and/or addresses) to non-PII identifiers (e.g. cookie and device IDs).
You can read more about our partnerships within the industry, including those companies for whom we help facilitate our customers’ advertising campaigns, at liveramp.com/partners.
==========
Online targeting and measurement
For example: 
For enabling our clients and partners to connect your online behavioral preferences across the various browsers and/or devices you use to more accurately market to you.
For example, you are logged into multiple devices (such as your desktop, your smartphone, and your tablet) using the same login and have clicked on a sports clothing company’s online advertisement on at least one of those devices.
==========
Where we determine that you are most likely the same user logged in on those different devices, we will communicate that information to the partner.
The sports clothing company can thus display more consistent offers to you via automated technologies (such as a non-personally identifiable cookie ID) on your different devices.
For online interest-based advertising displayed to you by our Distribution Partners at the direction of our clients.
==========
For example, if you have visited a clothing-related website and browsed through or purchased sports clothing, you may then see advertisements for sports clothing on other websites.
This is due to a cookie being placed on your device that has associated you with the advertiser’s audience of consumers interested in sports clothing, which is then used by the advertiser through our services and products.
For use in the measurement and performance of analytics of the effectiveness of our clients’ advertising campaigns.
For example, a sports clothing company wants to better understand if its website advertisements for a new line of sports clothing contributed to an increase in sales.
Our services and products can be used by the advertiser to see how many ads were viewed and actually clicked on, and if the consumer purchased any of the advertiser’s sports clothing.
For enabling our clients and partners to personalize their products and services to you, such as through website and email personalization or dynamic marketing and advertising optimization.
For example, if you have previously indicated an interest in sports clothing and then visit a sports clothing company’s website, that company can display offers for sports clothing tailored for you on their website.

==========

This information is not owned by LiveRamp, and thus is not subject to the processes or choices described in this or related policies.
To exercise your rights with respect to that information, you must contact whichever company or organization is the “controller” or “business” that holds it.
==========
Our Security Philosophy
LiveRamp’s security program is designed to reduce risk in alignment with business goals and the protection of the consumer data entrusted to us by establishing and leading the execution of a comprehensive security strategy.

The Security team works in collaboration with the business to deeply understand business risks and changes, foster accountability for security, and strengthen the partnership between security and business leaders.
The Security Program aligns strategies to business goals by: 
Developing, implementing, and enforcing a security framework and using industry-standard techniques and technologies such as hashing, encryption, and firewalls.

Our Opt-out Options
LiveRamp offers several ways to opt out of the personal information that LiveRamp controls being shared with or sold to others through our products and services.
==========
These options are explained and accessed here.
Please note that there are specific opt-out choices available depending on your location (i.e., EU, California, Nevada) by following the instructions on the opt out page.
LiveRamp is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and Digital Advertising Alliance Canada (DAAC) and adheres to the DAA Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and Multi-Site Data, as well as related guidance.
LiveRamp subscribes to the DAA’s industry-wide cookie opt-out mechanism that can be found here and its mobile device ID opt out available through its AppChoices app.
Consumers who choose to opt out through these DAA mechanisms do not need to opt out of the equivalent mechanism with LiveRamp.
==========
Keep in mind that opting out of LiveRamp through our opt-out channels or through the DAA does not disable advertisements altogether.
Instead, opting out means that LiveRamp services will no longer be used to facilitate targeted advertising to your browser, device, or email address.
In other words, you will still see advertisements and receive email marketing, but they will be less relevant to you.
If you create a new email address, reset the mobile advertising ID on your device, or use a new browser, you will need to apply the appropriate opt out to that new email address, new device ID, and/or new browser as opt-outs are not necessarily transferred between email addresses, browsers, or devices.
