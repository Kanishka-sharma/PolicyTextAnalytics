Information Use

  SurveyMonkey.com reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior
  and characteristics.
We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various
  areas of the website.
SurveyMonkey.com collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping.
Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World
  Wide Web.

The IP addresses are analyzed
  only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer's IP address.
By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to
  SurveyMonkey.com.
(Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general
  terms where you're from.)
