Privacy policy
Delivering high quality writings ties with safeguarding the privacy and security of your information as the highest priority of our service, and we want to tell you about how we collect and handle information on our site.
When completing your order, we collect information from you only to better suit your needs and fulfill your order.
We do not disclose, sell or otherwise divulge any personally identifiable information to third parties, nor store your information beyond the scope of the project.
We do retain some information in the event of a failure to pay.
==========
We are committed to protecting from others the information you send us, and have adopted stringent safety measures to ensure your privacy.
Our company's servers are protected behind a corporate firewall with strict controls over internal and external access wherever possible.
We use SSL (secure socket layer) to transmit sensitive information, such as your credit card number.
SSL provides the highest level of encryption commercially available today for communications between a browser and web server, sending data over the "socket" - a secure channel at the connection layer.
If at any time we change our policy we will update our privacy statement and notify you by email.
If you have any questions or concerns about the use of your information, feel free to contact us
