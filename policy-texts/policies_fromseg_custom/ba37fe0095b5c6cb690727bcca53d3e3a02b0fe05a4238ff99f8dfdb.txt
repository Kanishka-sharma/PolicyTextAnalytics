Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.

3 Enjoying Spotify
Here's some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.
3.1 Service Options
You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.
==========
Certain options are provided to you free-of-charge.
The Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the "Free Service."
Other options require payment before you can access them (the "Paid Subscriptions").
We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.
We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.
==========
We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.
The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.
We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.
If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.
Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.
==========
If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("Code"), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.
You may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.
In such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.
==========
3.2 Trials
From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "Trial").
Spotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
For some Trials, we'll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.
==========
By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.
IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.
4 Payments, cancellations, and cooling off
4.1 Billing
You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("Pre-Paid Period").
Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.
Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.
==========
Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.
If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
If you register for a Paid Subscription, you may change your mind for any or no reason and receive a full refund of all monies paid within fourteen (14) days starting from the day you sign-up for the relevant service (the "Cooling-off Period") in accordance with the following:
If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the Cooling-off Period for the Paid Subscription for which you are receiving a Trial ends fourteen (14) days after you start the Trial.
If you don't cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial ends, you lose your right of withdrawal and authorize Spotify to automatically charge you the agreed price each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription.
If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you authorize Spotify to charge you automatically each month until you cancel.
You agree that the Cooling-off Period is available for fourteen (14) days after your purchase but is lost once you use the Spotify Service during that period.
4.2 Renewal; Cancellation
Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.
==========
The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.
If you purchased your Paid Subscription through Spotify and you cancel your payment or Paid Subscription and/or terminate any of the Agreements (1) after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), or (2) before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.
If you wish to receive a full refund of all monies paid to Spotify before the Cooling-off Period is over, you must contact Customer Support.
When we process any refund, we will refund amounts using the method you used for payment.
==========
If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.
If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.

==========
24.3 ARBITRATION
If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 24.3.
is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:
24.3.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration
You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
There may be more limited discovery than in court.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.
This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.
24.3.2 Exceptions
Notwithstanding clause 24.3.1 above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court ,(2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
24.3.3 Arbitration rules
Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.
Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") then in force (the "ICC Rules") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.
Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of [the relevant state or country listed in clause 24.1], without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.
==========
24.3.4 Time for filing
Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.
If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.
24.3.5 Notice; Process
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").
==========
Spotify's address for Notice is: [Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA].
The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
==========
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.
All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.Except as required to enforce the arbitrator's decision and award, neither you nor Spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.
24.3.6 Modifications
In the event that Spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Spotify's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Spotify's address for Notice, in which case your account with Spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.
24.3.7 Enforceability
If the class action waiver at Section 24.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this Section 24.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements.
