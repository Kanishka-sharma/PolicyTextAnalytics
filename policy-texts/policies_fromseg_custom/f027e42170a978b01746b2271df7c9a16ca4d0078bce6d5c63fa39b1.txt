APPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT
Users of Mixpanel, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Mixpanel”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) trust us when they come to our website or use our services.
This privacy statement is to further that trust by being transparent with our privacy practices regarding personal information (as defined below) that we collect, use, share and secure from: (i) visitors to https://mixpanel.com (the “Site”); (ii) users who register to use our online, web-based platform for analytics services (the “Services” and such users, the “Customers”); and (iii) users of our mobile applications (“Application(s)”).
If you are a Mixpanel Customer, this statement also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
The use of information collected through our data analytics platform is governed by our Terms of Use and shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Customer has engaged Mixpanel.
==========
This privacy statement is not intended to discuss the collection or use of personal information by a Customer’s use of the Services and does not apply to third-party websites, applications, or services that display or link to different privacy statements.
Because a Customer’s collection or use of personal information is specific to their use and implementation of the Services, please consult a Customer’s privacy statement or the written contract between a Customer and Mixpanel for the Services for more information.
For additional detail, please see the Analytics Platform Activities section below.
If you have questions or complaints regarding this privacy statement or our privacy practices, please contact us at compliance@mixpanel.com.
==========
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect information, including personal information, in various ways when you use our Site, Applications and Services.
As used in this statement, “personal information” means any information which, either alone or in combination with other information, identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, and email address.
Information You Provide Us We collect information, including personal information, you provide us voluntarily.
For example:

When you enter in your first and last name, email address, and password when you create an account to access the Services (“Account”) or otherwise enter similar information into forms or surveys on our Site or Applications.
When you enter information using your Account, including postal address, phone number, fax number, company name and credit card payment information.
==========
If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information for internal analytics purposes.
Information Collected Via Technology We automatically collect certain information via technology:

IP Address, Location and Browser Information.
When you visit our Site or use our Applications, some information is automatically collected.
This may include information such as the operating system (“OS”) running on your device, internet protocol address (“IP Address”) (which may be used to obtain your geolocation), access times, browser type, language settings of the OS, and the website you visited before our Site.
We also collect information about how you use Mixpanel’s Site, Applications and Services, including the elements you have interacted with, metadata and other details about these elements, clicks, change states and other user actions.
==========
Pixel Tags.
In addition, we use “pixel tags” (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs).
Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies (as noted below), that are used to track online movements of web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded in web pages.
Pixel tags also allow us to send email messages and determine whether those emails have been opened, to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our Customers.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
We do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our users’ personal information.
==========
Browser Local Storage: We also store data locally on your device to enhance the user experience on our Site.
For example, browser local storage allows us to save the state of your current page so that when you return at a later time or refresh the browser, the page will remain the same.
We may also use browser local storage to: (i) save a list of items the user last used on the Site or Services (such as events and properties the user selected) so we can display “recently viewed items”; or (ii) marking once a user has seen a tutorial, video, tooltip or onboarding flow so that the user only sees the content one time.
==========
Mobile Services.
We may also collect information from your mobile device, such as but not exclusively the first time the Application is opened, mobile carrier, the device identifier (or “UDID”), and the type of device that is being used,  if you have downloaded our Applications.
This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and improve our Services and analytics platform.
Examples of information that may be collected and used include how you use the Applications and information about the type of device you use.
In addition, in the event our Applications crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model and OS version, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Applications.
We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running.
If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
==========
To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.
Access and Control of the Information We Collect We recognize an individual’s right to control the type of personal information that is collected about them.
==========
Our Customers can view, edit, or delete their personal information at any time.
Mixpanel retains your personal information while you are a Customer and will delete your personal information upon request.
Customers may also send requests for access to your personal information by emailing support@mixpanel.com.
Mixpanel will respond to any request to delete Customer personal information within a reasonable timeframe.
As discussed in the introduction, this privacy statement does not apply to the end-users tracked by our Customers.
If you are a customer of a Mixpanel Customer, please contact that Mixpanel Customer for access to your personal information.

==========
In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as payment processing for credit card billing.
