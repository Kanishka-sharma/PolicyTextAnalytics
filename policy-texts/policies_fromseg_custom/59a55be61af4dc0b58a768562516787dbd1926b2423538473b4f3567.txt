For Consumers:
Watchdog Complaints
We encourage you to use TRUSTe’s Watchdog Dispute Resolution process to report and resolve privacy complaints you may have concerning TRUSTe Sealholders or to report misuse of TRUSTe trademarks.
If you choose to file a Watchdog complaint about a TRUSTe Sealholder, we require that you provide your name, email address, city, state, country, postal code, name of the Web site, URL, and a description of the privacy issue you are reporting.
Any additional personal information you provide on the Watchdog Complaint Form is optional; we will use the information you provide to investigate your complaint and to send you a Watchdog Customer Satisfaction Survey once your complaint is resolved.
We encourage you to complete the survey; whether you do so or not is entirely up to you.
==========
We will not share your name or email address with the TRUSTe Sealholder that is the subject of your privacy complaint, or anyone else outside TRUSTe, unless you give us explicit permission to do so.
Please be aware, however, that if you do not permit us to share your name and email address, our ability to successfully resolve your complaint may be limited.
If you are a resident of a European Union Member State, and your Watchdog complaint concerns the offline information practices of a TRUSTe EU Safe Harbor Program Sealholder, you have two other options for filing your complaint: you may fax your complaint to us at (415) 520-3420, or mail it to TRUSTe Watchdog Program, 55 2nd Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105.
==========
We will use the personal information you provide in the manner described above for all Watchdog Complaints.
We post information about Watchdog Complaints on our “For Consumers” page on a monthly basis, but only in aggregated form (i.e., without identifying individual complainants).
==========
Consumer Opinion Surveys
We occasionally conduct online consumer surveys to learn about your views on important privacy issues.
We do not collect personally identifying information in these surveys.
We use the survey data to improve our programs and services, and may publicize the results as a public service.

If you provide us the personal information of others (including but not limited to, name and email address of a colleague who will assist you in completing your application), we will use that information only for the purpose of sending your colleague a user name and password to access your application.
If your company is a TRUSTe Web Seal Program Sealholder, we will use the information in your application to both provide you with ongoing TRUSTe support and communicate regularly with you.
