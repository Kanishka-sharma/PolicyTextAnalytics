Types of Cookies
There is a distinction between session cookies and persistent cookies and between first party and third party cookies.
Session cookies allow actions to be tracked during a single browser session.
They are deleted from your device when you close the browser.
==========
Persistent cookies remain on your device between sessions and allow a website to “recognise” a user on their return and to remember their preferences, they will remain stored on your device until deleted or they reach a specified expiry date.
Session and persistent cookies can be either first or third-party cookies - a first-party cookie is set by the website being visited.
A third-party cookie is issued by a party other than website being visited.
