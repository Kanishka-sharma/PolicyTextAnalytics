The truncated IP addresses of the visitor of the Publisher websites, specifically, the first three parts of an IPv4 IP address are parsed by AdUnity.
For example, an IP address of 12.214.31.144 would be parsed as 12.214.31.0.

The ADT is an online device identifier created by AdUnity when a visitor to the Publisher’s website visits a page for the first time using a particular type of device.
The data used to create the ADT are: the truncated IP address (as above); the name of the browser used to access the website at that particular time; the browser accept headers (which reveal language and other capabilities of browser) of the browser used to access the site at that particular time; and the Publisher account hash (which is a reference to the Publisher).

AdUnity also uses Cookies when working as a Data Processor.
==========
These Cookies are under the control of our customer, the Data Controller.
A list of these Cookies are provided under our Data Processing Agreement with our customer.
For the avoidance of doubt AdUnity does not use cookies for the AUX service.

AdUnity Enterprise Adserver


					The AdUnity Enterprise Adserver (EAS) is used by consumer brands and media agencies.
When these businesses use EAS, AdUnity works as a Data Processor on behalf of those businesses.
EAS is specifically used by consumer brands and media agencies to:
				

Deliver digital advertising content to websites
Count the number of ads delivered in a campaign
Count each time an ad is clicked
Create statistics regarding the total number of ads delivered and clicks per unique number of devices in any given campaign


					For the avoidance of doubt, EAS does not use Cookies and cannot be used to target individual devices with advertising.
==========
Any specific targeting of advertising is controlled entirely by the site owner or via AdUnity’s Token Direct technology (see below).
AdUnity always works within the data minimisation principles as described in GDPR.
Hence in order to create statistics regarding the distribution of advertising campaigns, AdUnity generates an anonymous device token (ADT) to approximately identify a device.
An ADT is created by AdUnity whenever an ad is delivered by EAS, or whenever EAS is used to count ad delivery or clicks.
The data used to create the ADT are: 
				

the truncated IP address of the visitor of the website where an ad is served by EAS.
Specifically, this means we do not read the last byte of an IPv4 address or the last four bytes of an IPv6 address.
For example, an IPv4 address of 12.214.31.144 would be parsed as 12.214.31.0.
==========
Therefore, the IP address which is considered Personal Data under GDPR has been anonymised, since it can no longer be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person
the operating system of the device used to access the site at that particular time
the name of the browser used to access the site at that particular time
the browser accept headers (which reveal language and other capabilities of browser) used to access the site at that particular time
the AdUnity customer account hash (which is a reference to the business using EAS)


					Given the way the ADT is created, it is probable that more than one device will share the same ADT (e.g. it is likely that two or more Samsung Galaxy S9 devices using Chrome and connected to the same wifi network will visit examplesite.co.uk).
In addition, it is not possible to check how many devices share the same ADT.
Furthermore, it is highly likely that any single device will have more than one ADT, (e.g. the same Samsung Galaxy S9 device will have a new ADT whenever it uses a different browser or it is connected to a different wifi network, even if it is visiting the website).
==========
Therefore, the ADT cannot be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person and hence is not personal data as defined in Article 4 of GDPR.
For the avoidance of doubt, ADT does not involve any physical storage on your device, for example, the ADT does not use or rely on Cookies.

AdUnity TokenDirect


						The AdUnity TokenDirect is a technology used by consumer brands to run targeted display advertising campaigns.
When brands use TokenDirect, AdUnity works as a Data Processor on behalf of those brands.
TokenDirect allows consumer brands to use the explicit consent they have gained from their customers and prospects to run targeted ad campaigns.
==========
This is achieved by creating a data link between consumer brands and website owners.
This data link is based on a system of interlocking Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) that utilise the TokenDirect system.
This means a website owner must agree to become the data processor of a given consumer brand in order to operate TokenDirect for that brand.
TokenDirect can only operate if and when you provide an explicit consent to a consumer brand for direct commercial communications (i.e. targeted marketing messages).
TokenDirect will store an encrypted reference of your consent to marketing on the device you are using to give the consent.
==========
This reference is called a PI ID.
A PI ID is an authentication token and cookie that references an explicit consent.
Attached to the PI ID record is a time-stamp, expiry date (of the consent) and purpose (of the consent).
It is a random string of alphanumeric characters.
A PI ID is pseudonymised personal information under GDPR.
==========
Under the law cookies for marketing and analytics require a consent to be stored on your device, the others do not.
The cookies that may be stored when you give your consent to a consumer brand using TokenDirect are detailed below.

						If you wish to withdraw consent for the PI or PIES cookie you will need to visit the site of the brand where you gave consent.
Please note AdUnity only operates TokenDirect as a Data Processor hence the TokenDirect cookie is under the control of our customer, the consumer brand.
