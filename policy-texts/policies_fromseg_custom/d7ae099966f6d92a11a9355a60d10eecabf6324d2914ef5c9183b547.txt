We also may request information about your traveler preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and ticketing options.
You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site.

When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through Expedia.com, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual.
You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Expedia.com with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.

Information from Other Sources.
We also may periodically obtain information about you from our business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information.
Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, which we use to correct our records and to facilitate proper delivery of travel information; and demographic information, which we use to better understand your potential purchasing preferences.

One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help customize your user experience.

Cookies and Other Web Technologies.
When you visit Expedia.com, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file).
For example, whenever you sign in as an Expedia.com member, we record your member ID and the name on your member account in the cookie file on your computer.
We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in."
Note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.

Suppliers, such as hotel, airline, cruise, or car rental companies, or activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations.
Throughout Expedia.com, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such.

==========
We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your other personal information.
Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through Expedia.com.
Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or to facilitate your travel reservation.

These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.
Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services.
You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours.

To the extent that our corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
==========
They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial e-mail they send to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future.
We also may share your information:
In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Expedia.com, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.
==========
In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.
We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.
