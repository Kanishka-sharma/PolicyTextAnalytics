How much is privacy worth to you?
Did you know that anytime you register a domain, your personal information is exposed 24 hours a day?
Your name.
==========
Your address.
Your phone number.
Your email.
It's all published online for anyone to see, as mandated by ICANN.
But you have the power to change this.
==========
With Private Registration…
Your domain is registered under the name Domains By Proxy, so its information is made public — not yours.
See the difference
You retain full control of your domain.
==========
You can cancel, sell, renew or transfer your domain, set up name servers for your domain and resolve disputes involving your domain.
You manage and control all email addressed to the domain, as well as the domain's contact information, with Domains By Proxy's patented registration and email handling systems.
You're still accountable for your actions.
Don't even think about using a private registration to transmit spam, violate the law or engage in morally objectionable activities.
==========
Your personal information is safe with us.
By having your domain registered with GoDaddy and your personal information protected by our affiliate company, Domains By Proxy®, you get two unique and powerful layers of security.
==========
In addition to your registrar account, you'll receive a separate account for managing your Private Registration, which can go a long way towards thwarting domain name hijackers.
You might not think your domain name is valuable, but it is.
Domain name hijacking has increased exponentially in recent years, with thieves worldwide attempting to steal domains to facilitate scams, relay spam and fraudulent information, spread malware, and worse.
==========

®
Domains By Proxy was launched in 2002 to address one of the biggest shortcomings of the Internet — loss of privacy.
In fact, Domains By Proxy was the very first Internet WHOIS privacy service, and was created in direct response to consumer demand.
==========
Supported by a patented private registration process, Domains By Proxy believes that now, more than ever, you should be able to keep your personal contact information private when you register a domain name.
What is Private Registration and why is it needed?
==========
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires that we make the contact information associated with domain names available to the public via the Whois directory.
The Whois database is an online repository of information associated with registered domain names.
It stores and publicly displays domain name information, such creation and expiration dates, the registrar of record, and its various contacts (registrant, billing, administrative, and technical).
Private domain registration is a service that hides personal domain name contact information like your name, address, email address, and phone number from the public.
We understand the thought of displaying your personal information to the public is alarming – but we're here to protect and help you!
==========
Our affiliate company, Domains By Proxy®, offers a private registration service that lets you list Domain By Proxy's contact information in the Whois database instead of your own!
What are the benefits of Domains By Proxy Private Registration?
Private registration through Domains By Proxy gives you full control over your private domain names while providing the protection you need online.
With Domains By Proxy, your personal identity is concealed, your privacy is maintained, domain-related spam is decreased, business endeavors are shielded, and domain name hijacking is prevented.
Domains By Proxy even creates a private and unique email address for each domain name.
You get to decide if you want the email forwarded to you, filtered, or completely blocked.
==========
All of these benefits and more will ensure that both you and your domain name are safe and secure.
Is my domain name eligible for Private Registration?
You can add private domain name registration to many domain name extensions, but some domain name registries do not allow private registration.
Why do I have a separate Domains By Proxy account?
Domains By Proxy is an affiliate company that is separate from your GoDaddy account.
Your Domains By Proxy account will further protect your private domain names and information.
You cannot update, move, or transfer a domain name into a separate account if it has privacy.
Therefore, domain hijackers would need to know your Domains By Proxy login information to cancel your private registration and steal your domain name.
==========
The additional layer of security that Domains By Proxy provides will give you a peace of mind you deserve.
What can I do in my Domains By Proxy account?
When you log in to your Domains By Proxy account, updates are simple to make.
==========
Private domain registration gives you the perfect combination of security and accessibility, so you can spend less time worrying about your domain name and more time building and maintaining your website.
If you move, create a new email address, or get a new phone number, you can simply log in to your Domains By Proxy account and update your contact information with ease.
As you manage your private registration, you can use the same contact information for all of your domain names, or you can individually update the contact information associated with each of them.
==========
Domains By Proxy makes it easy to prove you're the rightful owner of your domain, while protecting your online identity.
If a third party needs proof of registration for your private domain name for legal- or business-related reasons, simply request a Registrant Verification Letter and Domains By Proxy sends an official letter to a specified recipient confirming your domain name registration.
How can I access my Domains By Proxy account?
Visit DomainsByProxy.com and enter the Domains By Proxy Private Registration username and password that we send to you via email when you purchase private domain registration.
==========
If you don't have the email and you do not remember your login information, don't worry!
You can retrieve the customer number, request a password hint, and reset the password on Domains By Proxy's website.
