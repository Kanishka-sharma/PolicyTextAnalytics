About our Business and our approach to Data Laws
Location Sciences provides services to the digital advertising industry, such as media agencies and their clients, the advertisers.
Our services centre around verifying the accuracy of location data in order to prevent the fraudulent use of digital advertising technology, and at the same time measuring the quality and accuracy of location-based advertising campaigns.
Anonymised, aggregated data is also used in order to generate statistical insights about advertising audiences.
Our technology is embedded within Verify-enabled digital advertisements that you are served, in order to detect fraud by analysing the accuracy and quality of location data transmitted through the digital advertising exchange during a digital advertising campaign.
It performs these tasks without compromising the privacy of any individual who has consented to location-based advertising.
Location Sciences identifies itself as a Data Processor, and a Data Controller where data collected via the Website are concerned under UK and European Data Protection law (The UK Data Protection Act 2018, EU GDPR 2016/679).
As such, we are responsible for upholding your rights as a Data Subject.
==========
This Notice will set out these rights as clearly as possible and will explain how to contact us or a competent authority if you have any enquiries or complaints.
You have the right to contact us in order to request the restriction of processing, to manage consent, to correct, or to erase your personal data at any time, where relevant.
You will find more details about your rights under the GDPR and other relevant legislation further on in this Notice.
If you should have any questions regarding this Privacy Notice, or if you wish to request a copy of your personal information, an email request should be sent to our Data Protection Officer via:
dataprivacy@locationsciences.com
Location Sciences adheres strictly to our legal duty to protect any personal information we collect from you.
You may lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in the event you determine that we are not in compliance with applicable Data Protection law.

In these circumstances, the personal information that you give us will only be used to provide the information or service you have requested.
Personal information is not disclosed to third parties unless this is indicated on the web page and / or relevant form at the point of collecting information from you, or as required by law.

==========
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘Your Rights’ below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Location Sciences takes the protection of your information very seriously.
We use encryption (SSL) to protect your personal data when appropriate, and all the information provided to Location Sciences is stored securely once we receive it.
Location Sciences may store your personal data on secure servers either on our premises or in secure third party data centres

Verify & TCF 2.0: Purposes and Legal Basis of Data Collection
Location Sciences is a member of the industry group the Interactive Advertising Bureau, or IAB.
We are registered as a participant in the TCF 2.0, the recognised online advertising industry framework run by the IAB to promote transparency and compliance with applicable data privacy laws for all participants in the process of serving advertisements to your device.
We do not collect or receive personal information that directly identifies individuals (such as names, addresses, phone numbers or email addresses), and so we do not identify an end user’s actual real-world identity via our technology.
However, some of the data which we process (such as device ID numbers, IP addresses and location data) are considered as “personal data” for the purposes of some data protection legislation, and so it is therefore our Notice to treat the data which we process in the provision of our Services as “personal data” in accordance with the requirements of applicable local laws and regulations.
Location Sciences does not have a direct relationship with the consumers whose data we receive from Partners or third parties and process on their behalf.
Instead, we put in place binding agreements with our Partners to ensure that the data that it has passed to us has been obtained in line with TCF 2.0 standards, ensuring that consent has been properly obtained where relevant.
==========
Under the TCF 2.0, we have declared the purposes for which we collect personal data, and the legal basis for each purpose:
Purpose Legal Basis
To store and/or access information on a device Consent
To measure Ad performance Consent + Legitimate Interest
To apply market research to generate audience insights Consent
To measure content performance Consent + Legitimate Interest
To develop and improve products Consent
For Information storage and access Consent
For Measurement Consent
Special Purpose Legal Basis
To ensure security, prevent fraud and debug Legitimate Interest
We also use precise geolocation data and have declared this as a “Special Feature” under the TCF 2.0 in order to support the purposes stated above.
We rely upon consent as the legal basis for this special feature.

Location Sciences Software Development Kit: Purposes and Legal Basis of Data Collection
The Location Sciences Software Development Kit (SDK) constitutes code that is embedded within an iOS or Android application.
As previously stated in this Notice, in order to promote transparency and control over personal data, we are registered in TCF 2.0, the industry framework run by the IAB.
The SDK does not collect or receive personal information that directly identifies individuals (such as names, addresses, phone numbers or email addresses), and so we do not identify an end user’s actual real-world identity via our technology.
However, some of the data which we process (such as device ID numbers, IP addresses and location data) are considered as “personal data” for the purposes of some data protection legislation, and so it is therefore our Notice to treat the data which we process in the provision of our Services as “personal data” in accordance with the requirements of applicable local laws and regulations.
Location Sciences does not have a direct relationship with the consumers whose data we receive from Partners or third parties and process on their behalf, but we do put in place binding agreements with our Partners to ensure that the data collected by the SDK is lawfully obtained, particularly where consent is used as the legal basis for the collection of that Data.
==========
Under the TCF 2.0, we have declared the purposes for which we collect personal data, and the legal basis for each purpose:
Purpose Legal Basis
To store and/or access information on a device Consent
To measure Ad performance Consent + Legitimate Interest
To apply market research to generate audience insights Consent
To measure content performance Consent + Legitimate Interest
To develop and improve products Consent
For Information storage and access Consent

We rely upon consent as the legal basis for this special feature.

6.
==========
How long do we keep your information for?
We will hold your personal information on our systems only for as long as required to provide you with the service you have requested.
Where you sign up to receive e-mail marketing from us we will retain your e-mail address after you ‘opt-out’ of receiving e-mails in order to ensure that we continue to honour and respect that request.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, for research or statistical purposes.
In these cases we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Your Rights
As an UK or EU citizen data subject you have rights in relation to your personal data.
Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.
Right of Access
You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a “subject access request”).
Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully.
It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your personal data.
You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a Subject Access Request.
You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.
==========
Your Right to Rectification and Erasure
You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate.
You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten”).
Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right.
==========
Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.
You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request.
If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is.
You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.
==========
Your Right to Restrict Processing
Where we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the section of this Notice which explains why we use your personal data) you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.
You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it.
Your Right to Portability
Where you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.
Because of the kind of work that we do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact.
However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.
==========
Your Right to stop receiving communications
For details on your rights to ask us to stop sending you various kinds of communications, please contact us.
Your Right to object to automated decision making and profiling
You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.
Exercising your rights
When you write to us making a request to exercise your rights we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are.
==========
We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity.
It will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it.
The clearer and more specific you can be the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request.
If you do not provide us with sufficient information then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case we will tell you)

Cookies
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computer and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
==========
Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.
Cookies record information about your online preferences.
Users have the ability to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time.
The last of these, of course, means that certain personalised aspects of the website cannot then be provided to that user.
Each browser and device is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
If you have set your computer to reject cookies you can still browse locationsciences.ai anonymously until such time as you wish to register for locationsciences.ai services.
==========

Please note, that if you use multiple browsers you will need to opt out of receiving cookies on each device and for each browser.
Also, if you change devices or delete cookies from your device you will need to repeat this opt-out process.
Location Sciences’ cookies
Information supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better online user experience and assist us to analyse the profile of our visitors.
