How long does Evernote store my information?
Evernote's mission is to help you remember everything important in your life.
In order to do that, we make the Content you store in Evernote readily accessible to you, until you make the decision to delete it.
If you delete your Content and then sync, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service.
The Evernote service’s back-up systems may retain residual copies of your deleted Content for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.
Evernote provides you with features that allow you to communicate and collaborate with other users.
Please note that deleting your copy of these communications (such as messages) won't delete copies existing in the accounts of people you were interacting with.
For users who are inactive for extended periods of time, we may close your account to satisfy our obligations under applicable law, and in accordance with our data retention policy.
==========
If that happens, we will try to notify you before taking any action.
What happens if I want to stop using Evernote?
As described above, you can delete your Content at any time, and you can stop using the Evernote service at any time.
==========
And as we promise in our third law of data protection, your data is portable.
You can export your notes at any time, as explained here.
What happens if Evernote closes my account?
If Evernote deactivates your account due to a TOS violation, then you may contact us to request deletion of your Content, and we will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.
Where does Evernote store my information?
When you use Evernote Software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable applications, some of your data will be stored locally on that device.
