We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that trust seriously.
What does this privacy policy cover?
Within this privacy policy, we will cover our practices around the data we collect from publishers who sign up to use Skimlinks on their website, as well as the data we collect when end-users interact with Skimlinks on publisher websites.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

==========
What does Skimlinks do on your site?
Once you are accepted to use Skimlinks on your website, and have added the Skimlinks code to your site template, it will download a javascript file to your end-user’s computer when they view one of your webpages.
This javascript file will, depending on what products you have enabled via the publisher interface, do the following:

Collect and store information about links that users on your site click on, so we can monetize the ones from participating merchants, and report on other outbound clicks for your reports
Collect and store information about publicly accessible content (i.e. body text) on your page, so we can find and turn product/merchant references into shopping links
Drop a Skimlinks cookie when a user clicks an outbound link, so we can record anonymous information about the pages, links and merchants visited by users across our publisher network.
This will be used to optimize the service we provide, to deliver reporting and analytics to you, and so the links we create/monetize are to products and merchants that your users prefer.
Your users can find out more about opting out of this behavioural optimization here.
Do you need to update your privacy policy if you use Skimlinks?
It is important that you add to your own Privacy Policy to indicate to your users that you are engaged in affiliate marketing through a third-party service, but that no personally identifiable information is obtained or stored at any time.
==========
How do we use cookies on our website?
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies on our website.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies via your browsers ‘clear cookie’ function.
Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our publishers to enhance the experience on our website and publisher interface.
==========
What we share with third parties?
We use an analytics company to understand how visitors use our website.
The use of cookies by this tracking and analytics company is not covered by our privacy policy as we do not have access or control over these cookies.
We may share with certain key partners and advertisers some anonymous information in order to optimize our advertiser relationships and increase revenue yields for you, the publisher.
We will never drop a third-party’s cookies within our own javascript.
==========
If the assets Skimlinks use to operate its business are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we hold to that party, but they will remain subject to the commitments made in this Privacy Policy.
How we keep your data secure
All information you provide to us is stored in the EU and USA on secure servers that are protected in secure facilities including firewall protection.
Skimlinks has implemented such technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorised access or improper use.
We will continue to enhance security as new technology becomes available.
==========
While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
Access authorisation is granted to key Skimlinks staff only.
Backups are run to prevent loss of information, and our Internet servers are housed in secure facilities.
We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally.
==========
However, it remains each publisher’s responsibility:

to protect against unauthorised access to your details and the Skimlinks publisher interface;
to log off or exit from the Skimlinks publisher interface when not using it;
and to keep his/her password secret

Changes in this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.
If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our Publisher Interface.
End-user Privacy Policy »
What is Skimlinks?
Skimlinks is a service used by publishers to help them earn an income.
==========
It is intended to be unobtrusive and seamless to your user experience, and works by creating/tagging links to where products can be purchased online within the content you are reading.
If you buy something as a result of clicking on these links, the publisher is paid a referral fee by the merchant through us.
This referral fee does not come out of your pocket, nor does it affect the price you pay or the experience you have on the merchant site.
==========
What does Skimlinks know about me through the sites I visit?
We do not know anything about you personally at all.
We do not capture any personally identifiable data like your name or email address or contact details, nor do we know your age, gender, or anything else about you personally.
We do store your IP address, from which we can determine your geography.
We need this information to ensure the links we create are to merchants in your country.
We do not use this information to identify who you are as an individual.
==========
We also store information about the device you use to access the internet, such as the browser type, browser version, and device you use to access sites within our publisher network.
This helps us ensure we can diagnose and fix browser compatibility issues more swiftly, and optimize our service to suit the preferred browsing environments.
What information does Skimlinks collect about me through your technology and how do you use this information?
We aim to be a useful service to you, providing you with relevant and useful links to products you are likely to be interested in, and to merchants that you are likely to want to buy from.
==========
To achieve this, we collect anonymous information, using cookies, about the websites within our publisher network that you visit, which of our links you click on, and whether you make a purchase (although we do not always know this).
As part of the information available in standard web serving logs, we also store information about the referrer, i.e. the website page from which you arrived at the current website page you are on.
However, at no time do we know who ‘you’ are, nor is there any way for us to identify you.
We don’t combine any information we store with outside sources to find out anything personal or identifiable about you.
==========
All we know is that these actions were done by an anonymous individual, and we use this to try and serve this anonymous individual relevant useful product links as they browse that site and other sites within our publisher network.
If you are browsing on any secure, private or password-protected sites, we do not know about, collect or store content from the sites you visit.
We only know about the content (i.e. words and links) on websites that you visit that are publicly accessible to anyone on the web.
==========
We use this information to identify if any product or merchant references are made in this content, so we can serve an appropriate shopping link for that product within or alongside the content.
There is no other information that we collect on publisher sites, for example, we do not store or record any content users enter into forms on a website, or any data about advertisements and other services that the publisher runs on their site.
We use our cookies to collect the information we need to optimize the product/merchant links we monetize/show, and improve the service we provide to publishers and to end-users.
==========
However, we do not ever drop any third-party cookie within our own javascript, so you can be certain that your data and privacy is being protected in the manner we describe within this policy.
How can I disable the display of Skimlinks personalized links?
If you no longer want Skimlinks to store data about the websites you visit, the links you click and the merchants you buy from, simply opt-out here.
==========
This will mean Skimlinks will not drop cookies as you browse websites in our publisher network.
However, Skimlinks will still operate on pages that you visit, and still create links in content if the publisher or service has chosen to install Skimlinks on their website.
We just won’t optimize these links based on your preferences and behaviours, nor will we associate the websites you visit and shop from to a specific cookie.
Also, in order for referral fees and commissions to be paid by merchants to publishers, Skimlinks works with affiliate networks and other ad networks that manage the direct merchant relationships.
These affiliate and ad networks will use their own cookies in order to track if a sale has occurred, as most of these parties will only pay publishers when a referral has been successful, i.e. a sale was completed.
These cookies will continue to be dropped by the affiliate and ad networks.
==========
What is my opt-out status?
You can find out your current opt-out status with Skimlinks’ technology, as well as opt-out or opt-in again, on our opt-out page.
Please note: This opt-out service relies on a cookie being set on your browser.
We must maintain the cookie on your browser in order to recognize you as an opted-out visitor.
You must opt-out again if you clear that cookie from your browser, use a different internet browser, or use a new computer to access the internet.
