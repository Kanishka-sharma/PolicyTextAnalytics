If you wish to opt out of our Service, please go to our opt-out page.
We may use third party vendors to enhance the Service (e.g. for purposes of retargeting).

When you opt out of the Service, we place a cookie on or otherwise identify your browser or device (and/or employ similar technology) to prevent future collection of Usage Information or non-Personal Information.

If you browse the web from multiple devices or browsers, you will need to opt out from each device or browser to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them.
For the same reason, if you procure a new device, change browsers or delete the Bombora opt out cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out task again.
