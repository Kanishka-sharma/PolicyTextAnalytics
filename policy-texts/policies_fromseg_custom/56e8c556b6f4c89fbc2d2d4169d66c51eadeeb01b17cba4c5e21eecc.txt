         Re: Privacy on the Net 

The Internet is 
          a community that allows unparalleled access to knowledge, communication, 
          and commerce.
Community is built on trust.
==========
Inherent in trust 
          is the concept of your right to privacy.
Bottom line: You deserve to 
          be able to control the uses of your personal information to protect 
          your privacy.
==========
To that end, you 
          should be given notification about what information a Web site collects 
          and with whom it shares that information.
You have a right to choose 
          whether or not that information will be shared with a third party.
==========
You 
          should be able to access the information that youâ€™ve left on a Web site.
And you should be assured that the Web site has taken the appropriate 
          security precautions to safeguard your personal information.
==========
In this spirit, 
          we've come together as leading online companies to promote the open 
          exchange of ideas and information and to raise awareness about online 
          privacy.
Our goal is to educate the Web community about how they can 
          control the uses of their personal information to protect their privacy 
          online.
We can't do it 
          without you.

Whether you are a Web user who wants to learn more about 
          privacy on the Internet, or you are a Web publisher who wants to promote 
          ethical privacy practices, we welcome you to join the Privacy Partnership 
          2000.
The Privacy Partnership 
          is an ongoing grassroots initiative, open to all, that is intended to 
          educate the Internet community about this important issue.
Although 
          it is an ongoing campaign, during the Summer of 2000 you'll see the 
          next wave of the Privacy Partnership announced, discussed, and linked 
          to from many of your favorite Web sites.
==========
We believe that, 
          working together, we can build trust and awareness in this new medium.
With your help, we can keep the Web a place you can believe in.
Sincerely,

AltaVista, 
         America Online, Brightstreet, Excite@Home, IBM, Intel, Lycos, Microsoft, 
         Persona, RealNetworks, Verizon Communications, Yahoo! and TRUSTe.
