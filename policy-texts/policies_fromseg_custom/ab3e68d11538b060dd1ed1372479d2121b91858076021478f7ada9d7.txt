7a.)
==========
Resource Usage 
User may not: 
	a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds.
There are 
	numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI 
	scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.
b) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on 
	the server.
This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.c) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.d) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) 
	network.
==========
e) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client.
Please note
that you may link to torrents off server, but may not host or store
them.

	g) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, 
	battlefield1942, etc
	h) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes

the local file rather than the URL.
Instead of
include("http://yourdomain.com/include.php") use include("include.php")
7b.)
==========
INODES 
The use of more than 50,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in suspension.
Accounts found to be exceeding the 50,000 inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup
system to avoid overusage.
Every file (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.
Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that constantly 
create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension.
The primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox.
Over time, tens of thousands of messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit.
To disable your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose "Mail", then "Default Address", "Set Default Address", and then type in: :fail: No such user here
8.)
==========
Bandwidth Usage 
You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance.
This allowance varies 
	depending on the hosting package you purchase.
Should your account pass the 
	allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start 
	of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is 
	purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a 
	higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an 
	additional fee for the overages.
Unused transfer in one month cannot be 
	carried over to the next month.
9a.)
==========
Money back Guarantee 
On dedicated servers and colocation no full refund will be honored -- 
	the 45 day money back guarantee does not apply.
We reserve the right to 
	refund a prorated amount or no refund at all.
Each of HostGator's managed shared and reseller servers carry a 45 day 
	unconditional money back guarantee on them.
If you are not completely 
	satisfied with our services within the first 45 days of your service, you 
	will be given a full refund of the contract amount.
Remember, this is only 
	for monthly shared or reseller packages and does not apply to dedicated 
	servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain 
	name purchases.
9b.)
==========
Uptime Guarantee
If your shared / reseller server has a physical downtime that is not
within the 99.9% uptime you may receive one month of credit on your
account.
Approval of the credit is at the discretion of HostGator
dependant upon justification provided.
Third party monitoring service
reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors
including the monitor's network capacity/transit availability.
The
uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the
operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime
reported by other individual services.
To request a credit, please contact
sales@hostgator.com with justification.
All requests must be made in
writing via email.

Uptime guarantees only apply to shared / reseller
solutions.
Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in
which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down
which is not related to our uptime guarantee.
