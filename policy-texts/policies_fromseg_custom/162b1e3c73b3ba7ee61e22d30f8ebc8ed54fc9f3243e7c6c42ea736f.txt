International Transfers Flutter Entertainment plc operates businesses in multiple jurisdictions some of which are not located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
Countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws.
Where we transfer personal information from the EEA to other countries in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in your home country, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of data privacy protection.
==========
For example, we use approved contractual clauses, intragroup agreements and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your personal information protect it.
We take steps to ensure that the information we collect is processed according to this privacy policy and the requirements of the applicable law wherever the data is located.
Please contact us below if you require further information.

Other circumstances in which we share your personal data Apart from the functions set out in this policy, we do not share your personal information with third parties except where we are compelled or permitted by law to do so.
These circumstances are rare, but may require us to share information with the police or other law enforcement agencies, the courts, statutory authorities (e.g. in connection with tax matters) and sporting bodies (in connection with sporting integrity issues) in any of the countries in which we operate.
Where necessary to protect or defend our rights and interests, resolve disputes, respond to what we consider to be incorrect or misleading information provided to a media outlet, or enforce our agreements, we reserve the right to share personal data with regulators, external legal advisors, debt recovery and tracing agencies, and media outlets, although again these circumstances are rare.
==========
If ownership of all or part of our business changes or we undergo a reorganization or restructure, we will transfer your personal information to the new owner or successor company so we or they can continue to provide the services you have requested.
Whenever we share personal information, and whatever the circumstances, we will always do so legally and with due regard to your privacy.
If we receive a request from law enforcement or other statutory bodies, we do not disclose personal information without a warrant, court order or other legally valid proof of authority.
