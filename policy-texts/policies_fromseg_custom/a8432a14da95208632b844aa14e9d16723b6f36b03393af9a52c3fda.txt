We have sought to set these lawful bases out for each processing activity in detail in the table above.

==========
Security
We understand that the security of your personal information is important to you.
When handling personal information, security is paramount and we seek to ensure that personal information is adequately and appropriately protected.
We use appropriate, technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.
The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.

International Data Transfers 
We are a global business.
This means that it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal information outside of the country in which it was collected, or your jurisdiction of residence, when transferring it to other entities or offices within Stats Perform and our service providers and business partners located in other countries.
If you are based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), your personal information may be transferred to or accessed from outside the EEA in countries which are not governed by data protection laws equivalent to those in force within the European Union (“EU”).
Specifically, our Website servers are located in the UK, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.
==========
This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.
We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
==========
How Long We Retain Your Personal Information 
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
==========

If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” section below.

Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
