Full Privacy Notice
How and why we collect data and covering your choices.
(last update, July 10, 2015)
This notice outlines how and why GroupM collects data from visits to its websites.
It also outlines how and why GroupM collects and uses data through services to clients and explains what these practices mean to you -- and how you can manage choices.
To keep this simple and as brief as possible, you can see definitions of words that may be unfamiliar by hovering over them with your mouse, or tapping from your mobile device.
==========
Important
Please check back often as this notice is updated from time to time.
Your use of GroupM websites means you agree to this privacy notice.
This is GroupM’s full Privacy Notice.
It only applies to GroupM.com, GroupMPublications.com, (“Website”) and Services (“Services”) GroupM provides to its clients.
This notice does not apply to any other sites, products or services of GroupM, its affiliates or its clients.
==========
How information collection on our sites works:
Meet Maggie: To show how information is collected on our Websites and across the internet, we’ll use Maggie as example.
Maggie will help show one person’s journey on the web, and how we help make her online experience more meaningful and relevant.
==========
Maggie is a 42 year-old mother of three who lives in a small town on Long Island, New York.
Maggie likes to shop, research, and read content online, particularly about her gardening hobby.
==========
She uses email and social media and enjoys receiving advertising relevant to her interests, so she can learn about new products and ideas.
However, Maggie is concerned about her privacy and what data and information is collected about her.
She often wonders how her computer knows she likes gardening when she sees gardening ads, even when she is not on a website about gardening.
The privacy principles below will help Maggie and others better understand just that.
==========
The principles explain who GroupM is and how we collect and use information in connection with the GroupM.com Website and GroupM Services.
GroupM.com Website Privacy Practices
Before we get detailed on our privacy practices, we want to point out that we collect data in two different ways.
This section talks about our data collection and use practices for this Website; later we will talk about data collection and use via services provided on behalf of our clients.
==========
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information (information that doesn’t identify you by name): When Maggie goes to www.GroupM.com, we automatically gather non-personal information (also known as non-PII) by placing a cookie, or number, on her device.
We do this to help understand what parts of our website Maggie enjoys most.
This allows us to improve with content that Maggie prefers for future visits.
We do not automatically collect or use any of Maggie’s personally identifiable information (PII) when she visits www.GroupM.com.
Collection and use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?
We only use PII when a user voluntarily provides it.
There are a few instances where we may collect PII from Maggie.
==========
But, we never collect PII without consent and never use PII in advertising or marketing placements.
Examples where Maggie or other users might voluntarily provide PII include:
Responding to Maggie’s requests: we keep a record of information, including email address and other PII solely for responding to a user’s request.
==========
For example:
If Maggie clicks on the “contact us” link and submits a question or comment, we will collect her name, email address, and phone number in order to send her a reply.
If Maggie voluntarily asks to be added to our newsletter list, we would collect her email address to send her our email newsletter.
Purchases: If Maggie were to purchase or subscribe to GroupM services for a fee via GroupM.com, information collected such as payment information would only be used for processing payment.
How to manage information we have about you and your GroupM.com subscriptions.
If at any time Maggie decides she would like us to remove her from our marketing e-mails or newsletters, unsubscribe from our database, or if she’d like to change or correct any contact information, she can contact us at privacy@groupm.com.
==========
She must include her name, email address, and clear instructions regarding changes she is requesting.
She may also unsubscribe from email newsletters by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of the email.
==========
About Cookie use and similar technologies on GroupM.com: When Maggie uses our Website, she is providing consent for our use of cookies.
GroupM uses cookies, pixels and similar technologies to collect Non-PII about visits to our Website.
A cookie is a file placed on a user’s browser that uniquely identifies browser and device.
==========
Cookies allow us to customize Maggie’s website experience to include more content she likes, and less content she may find not useful.
If Maggie does not agree to our use of cookies, she may prevent their use through her browser settings, elect not to use this Website, or just opt out of cookies on our Website as described below.
By opting out, Maggie may not be able to use certain Website features or take full advantage of all offerings.
Sometimes a cookie resides on Maggie’s device for just the single time she’s visiting our website; this is called a session cookie.
Sometimes a cookie remains on Maggie’s device until she deletes it; this is called a persistent cookie.
==========
Both types of cookies may be used on our Website.
Cookies help us analyze how users like Maggie use our Website by telling us the pages viewed.
They also tell us about the number of visitors to the Website and the webpages that referred them.
==========
The Google Analytics cookie we use is an example of a persistent cookie.
Opt out of cookies placed from visits to GroupM.com by Clicking Here.
You can also Change your browser settings to prevent cookies.
Does GroupM.com share any information with other vendors or partners?
==========
If permitted by law, we may provide access to a user’s PII and/or Non-PII to our vendors and contractors (also known as third parties) who are performing services on our behalf.
For example, if Maggie uses a credit card to subscribe to a service, we may securely share her credit card information with our credit card processing service to transact her payment.
These vendors are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose.
==========
The GroupM Site uses social media widgets including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn so users can easily share information about their visits with “likes” or “shares.”
Always review the privacy policy of social media sites as their data collection practices are separate from GroupM’s practices.
Additionally, we must disclose a user’s information when we believe we’re legally obligated to, or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding prohibited activities, such as incidents of hacking, misuse, or other prohibited activities.
==========
Use of this site by Children & Children’s data: We’re sensitive to children's privacy.
Our Website is not developed for or directed at children under age 13.
We specifically request that children not provide personal information (PII) through our Website.
If a user believes her child provided PII and would like it deleted from our database, she can contact us at privacy@groupm.com.
Likewise, if we become aware we’ve collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we’ll delete it on our own.
==========
California Online Privacy Protection Act Disclosures: California law requires us to tell you that GroupM does not authorize third parties to collect PII without separate consent by you, the user.
Because “tracking” is not yet defined by industry standard, GroupM does not honor Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms.
==========
Data retention and storage: Our Website visitors should know we may use cookie information for advertising purposes for up to 13 months, and summary reports with cookie information may be kept longer.
Our Website and databases are maintained in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.
When a visitor uses the Website or our Services, he/she gives us consent to collect and store information in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany and to use information as specified within this privacy notice.
However, if he/she has opted out or chosen not to share information we will not collect it in the first place.
==========
Information Security: Maintaining the privacy of our user’s information is very important to us which means we take care and pay special attention to our security measures to protect user information from data breaches.
We follow industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of information.
This includes necessary physical, electronic, and management activities to protect information integrity, access, and use.
Any information stored on our servers is treated as confidential.
But please do keep in mind no matter what we do to ensure safety, no transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Because of this, we ask that our users are aware of with whom they share their information, and what information they share.
==========
Linking to other websites/Third party sites: A link from our Website to another website does not imply our endorsement of affiliates or websites, and we do not control third party websites to which we link, nor assume responsibility for their content or privacy policies.
Once you follow a link to another website, the GroupM Privacy Notice no longer applies.
It’s important to always read the privacy policy of any website you are visiting.
Transfer of data upon change of control: Users should be aware that in the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction, including as part of a corporate reorganization of bankruptcy proceeding, we reserve the right to transfer all information (including any PII a user may have provided through the “contact us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to the acquiring party.
==========
GroupM Services Privacy Practices
This section outlines services we provide for our clients.
It concerns data collection and use on such sites (not GroupM.com), in conjunction with our services for clients.
This information is not related to what happens on GroupM.com.
It’s important you always review the privacy policy of any site you visit as practices vary.
==========
What Does GroupM do?
What does GroupM mean by their Services?
GroupM is a leading global media investment and media agency holding company.
==========
We focus on media buying and media strategy, and we continually evaluate innovative ways to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.
Protecting online user privacy in the course of our business is a priority and one we take very seriously.
GroupM provides client services such as media planning and buying; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; paid search placement and search engine optimization; and branded entertainment and sports sponsorships (“Services”).
Don’t get it?
==========
Allow us to explain a bit more about our Services, how information is collected and used, and how you can opt out should you choose to do so.
Interest Based Advertising (IBA)
Remember Maggie and her gardening hobby?
With Interest Based Advertising (IBA) technology, (also known as behavioral advertising or audience buying), Maggie will see more gardening ads online because she visits many gardening websites and reads a lot of online content about gardening.
If our client is a Brand that sells gardening tools, GroupM’s Services will help place ads on sites where people who like gardening, like Maggie, will see them.
==========
When Maggie visits websites, watches videos online, or clicks on ads, we store a number on her browser using a “cookie” to remember her visits.
Accomplished with partners (digital publishers such as online gardening magazines, for example), this cookie (number) will never collect personal information (PII) about Maggie, similar to how explained above.
More on this a bit later…
Because many websites Maggie visits are related to gardening, the anonymous number which identifies her machine or device is put in the “gardening enthusiast” interest category.
As a result, we may show Maggie ads that are relevant to gardening enthusiasts as she browses websites.
This is how we use information collected about Maggie through the cookie (number).
This is an industry standard approach; you can learn more about these practices at www.iab.net/privacymatters.
Remember the cookie does not tell us who Maggie is specifically.
==========
All we know is that someone used that particular device to view a gardening website.
We tag the device with the cookie so we can later serve more gardening ads to that device.
==========
NO PERSONAL INFORMATION is collected for IBA.
So what do we collect?
Through the process described above, we do not collect any of her PII and do not know Maggie’s name or any other personal information.
==========
We simply recognize the cookie (number) stored in her browser which tells us someone likes gardening websites.
We then show Maggie ads related to interests in gardening and based on inferred demographics associated with gardening.
We will never show ads based on sensitive information categories such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories.
==========
Sharing this information and how online advertising works:
Maggie’s Non-Personal information (non-PII) collected through our Services (or ads placed by us on behalf of clients) may be shared with our clients and vendors.
This is essentially how we do business and is how online advertising works.
==========
By sharing Maggie’s Non-PII with our clients and vendors, the information helps them deliver more tailored ads to potential customers.
The non-personal information allows clients to best understand what ads Maggie likes most based on how she interacts with the ads and when.
This also enables serving of personalized ads to Maggie’s devices so she sees ads relevant to her interests, hobbies and things she may be shopping for at the moment.
This information also helps clients formulate more efficient ad campaigns which can help Maggie in the long run.
==========
We do not collect PII via our clients’ ads, except in instances where consent is given by you or you provide the PII voluntarily, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share personal information collected on GroupM.com or other websites with anyone other than as set forth in this Privacy Notice.
What to do when you prefer not to share your non-personal information – how to “opt out”
Opting out of Interest Based Advertising (IBA) is different from opting out of cookies from GroupM.com as described above under the section about our “Website”.
While Maggie really enjoys receiving ads relevant to her gardening interests, if she, for some reason, chooses to stop sharing certain non-personal information for targeting advertising, she can “opt out” of some cookie, or number, placement.
If she opts out, it does not mean Maggie will stop receiving ads altogether.
It only means she’ll stop receiving ads tied to her interests.
Maggie has a few options on how she may opt out.
==========
One option would be to adjust her browser settings to block third party cookies.
She can learn how to do this by viewing the Browser “help” menu.
==========
In addition, she can go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s, (DAA), Consumer Choice page, http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ where Maggie will be able to opt out of allowing the companies listed on such site to place a cookie, or number, on her device.
Maggie needs to remember that if she opts out by clearing her browser cache or by resetting her cookies, she will have to take these steps from time to time, to opt out again.
GroupM is an active member of the Digital Advertising Alliance and complies fully with the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles.

WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information You Provide Us Through Your Correspondence on this Website
It is extremely rare that we collect personal information.
However, in the instance we do, the personal information we collect comes directly from our Site visitors.
We collect personal information from our visitors in the following situations:
When you submit inquiries through our “contact us” link on this website.
When a visitor signs up to receive our marketing emails or newsletters.
To submit information in connection with an employment inquiry.
When a visitor expressly enters information into a text field or otherwise submits information to us.
==========
We keep a record of the information you provide including your email address and any other Personally Identifying Information, (“PII”), you provide, solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or request.
PII includes name, address, telephone number, email address, or any other data used or intended to be used to contact specific person.
==========
We automatically receive Non-Personal Information (“Non-PII”) when you visit our Site.
Non-PII is any information where on its own cannot be used to identify, contact, or precisely locate a particular individual.
==========
Non-PII includes your IP address (in the US), browser information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, the date and time of your visit, and the web page you have visited immediately prior to visiting this Site, and more.
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, this information will never be shared with third parties without your consent.
==========
GroupM may pass your PII to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies so that they may contact you in connection with your inquiry.
PII passed on to a subsidiary or affiliate of GroupM in another country will receive protections in accordance with GroupM policies and local law.
==========
By using our Site you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules and regulations than in your country.
GroupM may provide you with the ability to purchase or subscribe to certain services on the GroupM website for a fee.
In such event, we will collect certain PII from you, including payment information, solely for the purpose of processing your purchase or subscription.

==========
Information We Collect Through our Services
We do not collect PII from users online through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients unless, in the rare instance, users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in a text field for example.
We do collect Non-PII to identify devices that we have interacted with before through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.
For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a device that has previously seen an advertisement we launched on behalf of a client.
Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an internet connection.
==========
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
Use of information for Services
As stated above, we may collect Non-PII regarding your web browsing, usage or interactions with advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.
Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements across numerous websites and to prevent excessive or repeated deliveries of the same advertisements.
We do this to better customize the sort of advertisements you see on various websites and for other purposes such as research and analysis.
For example, if we infer that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver interest-based online advertisements to you about a particular type of apparel.
You can learn more about such advertising practices by visiting www.iab.net/privacymatters.
==========
Disclosures for Europe
Please note – in Europe, an IP address is considered PII by applicable law.
If we conduct business in such countries and we know that you are located in such a country, we will treat your IP address as PII.
In such countries we interpose a “black box” which is operated by an independent third party and which separates the user’s IP address from other data we collect.
==========
If your browser does not accept cookies or if the opt-out-cookie is set, no tracking takes place.
targ.ad is a service of ours which places a cookie on your computer for the purpose of interest-based marketing as described above.
==========
This service is primarily used Europe.

This Non-PII may be used by our clients to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites and for other purposes as described above.

Further, we encourage our clients, as applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the information they are gathering is being used.
We urge you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to your online privacy.
==========
We may disclose a user’s Non-PII to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
In addition, and if permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose and provide access to a user’s PII and Non-PII to our vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf.
However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us.
