Our Services
C3 Metrics offers advertisers, agencies, and advertising networks analytical tools that enable our business customers to better understand advertising campaign performance and consumer behavior in connection with ad campaigns and activities undertaken on their behalf.
We help these customers gain insight into how, when, and why advertising performs.
Our service does this through observing consumer activity on our customers’ websites and then analyzing information about the advertising and marketing that you may have seen that relates to a consumer’s visits to that customer’s website.
We believe that if we can help companies deliver better advertising that is more effective to consumers, everyone wins.

Data Storage and Security
We retain the information we collect for up to one year.
After one year, we discard the information about individual users and retain only aggregated or summary data.
Even though we maintain the data we collect in an anonymous way, we have implemented security measures.
However, these methods may be inadequate or could otherwise be compromised.
==========
We cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information we collect.
Information Relating to Children
Our products and services are designed for those 13 years of age and older.
We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13.
Because we do not collect or use information directed at identifying whether or not a user is a child under 13, we cannot and do not identify consumer information in a way where we would know that a website visitor is a child under 13 years of age.
If for some reason we learn that a user is under 13 years of age and we can identify personal information relating to such a user, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.
Disclosures of Information We Collect
Some of our customers and the websites they advertise on may place their own cookies on your Internet browser outside of our service; however, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
==========
Sale or Transfer of Our Assets
In the event another company acquires all or most of our assets, all data compiled or owned by us may be among the items transferred in that transaction.
In such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this Policy.
We may transmit or share our data with service providers (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) in order for those service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf.
We may share the data we collect to do business with related third parties, such as our advertising clients.
We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
