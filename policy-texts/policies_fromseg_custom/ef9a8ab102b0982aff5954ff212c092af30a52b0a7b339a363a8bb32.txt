FOX Broadcasting Company ("FBC") 
                is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of 
                 applicable to all its U.S.-based companies.
FBC 
                has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which 
                describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable 
                information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals 
                located in the U.S. both online and off-line.
FBC does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years 
                of age.
From time to time FBC may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect 
                industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection 
                and use practices, the features of our web sites, or technology.
Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up 
                to date on our most current policies and practices.
==========
COLLECTION:  COLLECTION OF PII BY FBC
General.
FBC collects personally identifiable information ("PII" 
                -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, 
                mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or 
                enhance our relationship with you.
==========
When we collect PII from you 
                it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to 
                us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, 
                games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection 
                with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin 
                boards; or because you want us to furnish you with products, services 
                or information.
On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third 
                party, we use only reputable sources of such information.
==========
Cookies.
Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet sites 
                operated by FBC place on the hard drive of your computer.
FBC 
                uses cookies to identify your Internet browser and to determine 
                whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access 
                certain material on our web site(s).
However, FBC does not use 
                cookies or similar tools to collect or otherwise record any type 
                of PII provided by or about any FBC web site visitor.
Third party advertisements displayed on Internet site(s) operated 
                by FBC may also contain cookies.
==========
FBC does not control these advertiser 
                cookies and visitors to our web site(s) should check the privacy 
                policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.
On occasion, FBC may use cookies or similar tools to relate your 
                use of our web site(s) to personally identifiable information 
                obtained from you or a reputable third party.
For example, if 
                you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products 
                or promotions, cookie and/or other information about your online 
                activities may allow us to limit the materials we send you to 
                items we know you will find interesting, based on your prior online 
                activities and preferences.
==========
However, if FBC wishes to coordinate 
                your personal and web site activity information in this manner, 
                we will obtain your express prior consent (i.e., "opt in").
You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie 
                is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, without 
                cookies you may not have access to certain features on FBC's web 
                site(s).
==========
NOTICE:  FBC WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES
When FBC collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed 
                about who is collecting the information, how and why the information 
                is being collected and the types of uses FBC will make of the 
                information.
This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want 
                to send you information about their products and services and 
                therefore may want to share your personal information (See "Use" 
                below).
However, FBC will notify you of your options regarding 
                our use of your personally identifiable information, including 
                whether we can share it with outside companies, at the time of 
                collection (See "Choice" below).
Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from 
                consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription 
                form.
Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves 
                impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short 
                notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy 
                and other relevant information from us.
==========
FBC's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by 
                other companies.
Some of these third party sites may be co-branded 
                with an FBC logo, even though they are not operated or maintained 
                by FBC.
FBC's web site(s) also carry advertisements from other 
                companies as well as advertisements placed by national Internet 
                ad agencies.
==========
Although we choose our business partners and advertisers 
                carefully, FBC is not responsible for the privacy practices of 
                web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) 
                or for the privacy practices of third party or so-called national 
                Internet advertising companies.
Once you've left an FBC site via 
                such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check 
                the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser 
                site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from 
                you.
FBC's web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by our 
                business partners or by other companies that are part of the News 
                America Group.
==========
Visitors to those affiliated sites should still 
                refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which 
                may differ in some respects from this Policy.
Some of the advertisements that appear on the FBC website(s) 
                are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies 
                such as DoubleClick.
This company utilizes certain technologies 
                to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect 
                anonymous information about your visit to the FBC website(s), 
                including information about the banner ads they display, their 
                cookie and your IP address.
To opt out of information collection 
                by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies 
                they sue or their own privacy policies, please visit their website 
                at: .

CHOICE:  FBC WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII
FBC will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your 
                PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which 
                it was submitted.
You will also be able to choose whether your 
                information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with 
                FBC (i.e., not part of the News America Group of companies).
USE:  FBC'S USE OF PII
FBC will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this 
                Policy and for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other 
                uses are disclosed and you allow us to use your information in 
                other ways.
FBC may use PII in aggregate, anonymous form for research 
                purposes.
In most instances, FBC will delete PII from its records 
                as soon as possible; for example, sweepstakes entry information 
                will be retained only until a winner is selected or for as long 
                as the law requires.
==========
FBC may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with 
                us (i.e., part of the News America Group of companies).
FBC may 
                also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with 
                FBC, but would like to send you information about their products 
                and services, such as sponsors of promotions, sweepstakes or programs 
                that appear on the FOX Network.
However, you will always have 
                the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with 
                unaffiliated third parties.
==========
FBC employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate 
                business reason to obtain access to your PII.
Outside contractors 
                or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., 
                sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) 
                must comply with FBC's instructions with respect to PII, and may 
                only use PII to provide FBC with a specific service and not for 
                any other purpose.
If FBC obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, 
                our subsequent use of this information is governed by this Policy.
There may be instances when FBC may disclose PII without providing 
                you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of FBC, 
                other companies within the News America Group or their employees, 
                agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of 
                visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk 
                management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process.
==========
In addition, if FBC sells all or part of its business or makes 
                a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger 
                or business transfer, FBC may transfer your PII to a third party 
                as part of that transaction.
SECURITY: FBC PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII
FBC uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and 
                physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, 
                theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.
In addition, 
                FBC uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, 
                up-to-date and appropriately complete.
==========
ACCESS, REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII AND HOW TO CONTACT FBC ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS
Whenever possible, visitors to FBC may review the PII we maintain 
                about them in our records.
We will not be able to provide such 
                access to PII that we plan to delete from our records as soon 
                as we are allowed to by law.
However, prior to such deletion we 
                will not use that PII except for the purpose for which it was 
                submitted.
We will also take reasonable steps to correct any PII 
                a visitor informs us is incorrect.
If you would like to communicate to us about this Privacy Policy 
                or FBC's collection and use of your PII, to review, correct or 
                delete your PII, or to stop all future communication from us, 
                please contact FBC's Privacy Officer, Ms. Carolyn Gray at:
