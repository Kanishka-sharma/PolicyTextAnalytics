Introduction
Switch is committed to protecting personal data.
This Privacy Policy explains how Switch and its partners collect, use, and disclose information; and choices for managing information preferences where applicable.
This Privacy Policy is intended for:
publishers using Switch technology for advertising and analytics;
individual users of websites where Switch technology is used for advertising and analytics; and
individual users of the Switch website.
This Privacy Policy also includes details about data related to Switch’s marketing activities.
There is a section for each type of activity, which explains:
what data is collected and processed;
the purpose for collecting the data - how it is used;
the lawful basis for processing; and
how to review and update information and preferences.
==========
Online Advertising
Switch is a technology company.
We provide services to publishers which enable advertisers to place adverts on websites to reach their audience.
When a user visits a page, the website requests an advert to be displayed using Switch technology.
When this request is made, it is possible to include Personal Data so that advertisers can tailor the response.
==========
The data is also used to protect against fraud.
Sometimes the publisher will be the Data Controller and Switch will be the Data Processor.
For example, when the publisher has a direct contractual relationship with an advertiser partner, decisions about data will be made by them, and Switch will just process the data as a technology provider, pursuant to the Controllers’ instructions.
Sometimes Switch will also be a Data Controller.
This is the case when Switch has our own relationship with advertiser partners, and our own independent uses of the data.
==========
Understanding and managing the collection and processing of Personal Data differs depending on which party is the Data Controller, but as the touch point with the Data Subject, every website that collects Personal Data, should have a Privacy Notice that covers all scenarios.
Personal Data when Switch and the Publisher are each a Data Controller
The data Switch collects for its own uses are below.
The website from which the request for an advert originated, may collect additional personal data for their purposes, and the user should also refer to the website Privacy Policy to fully understand data engagement.
The information that Switch may collect and process:
Page URL
Device information
Location information as found in the IP address (and the IP address itself)
Pseudonymised identifier

How the data is used:
With consent, this data can be used for targeting advertising.
For example, the IP address may disclose that a user is in a London borough, and an advert for a London attraction may be picked as an advert which might be of interest.
With consent, this data may also be used for analytics.
==========
In other words, the publisher may want to find out how many of their website visitors access the site whilst in the UK, and therefore change their content appropriately.
The pseudonymised identifier is used to recognise the user’s browser, and to encode user preferences in relation to Personal Data so that they can be shared and interpreted in the advertising ecosystem.
It is also used to manage the frequency with which one advert is shown to a user.
==========
The data is also used for fraud prevention.
Activity is assessed to see if it might be non-human activity that is claiming to have viewed adverts with the intention of fraudulently claiming revenue from advertisers.
If it appears that a website page-load was not generated by a human, we simply take the decision not to request an advert.
==========
The lawful basis for processing when Switch is the Data Controller:  
Collecting this data must be lawful and transparent.
Where Switch is the Controller and data is collected for targeted advertising and analytics, the lawful basis is consent.
Users can set consent preferences per vendor via a prominent tool on the website page.
==========
Where consent either is not granted by proactive selection, or was not sought, personal data will not be used for these purposes.
When this data is collected for fraud prevention, the lawful basis is legitimate interest.
Forensiq are our partners for fraud prevention and their privacy policy can be viewed for more details.
Duration:
This data is kept securely in unaggregated form for 7 days.
After 7 days unaggregated data is deleted.

==========
Updating Consent Preferences:
Where consent is the lawful basis for processing, website users will be able to update their preferences via tools on websites.
Users can toggle consent on and off globally, or by vendor and purpose.
This preference is encoded in a string which is passed through the ecosystem and tells vendors that are relying on consent, whether they have permission to use the data.
User consent will be renewed periodically by the tool used to record preferences, being shown to users again.
To access the tool at other times, the user can clear cookies, which gives the impression that the user is new and has not yet set preferences.
==========
Personal Data when a Publisher using Switch technology is the Data Controller
When the publisher uses Switch technology to deliver on its own contracts and collect Personal Data for its own uses, the publisher is the Data Controller and Switch is the Data Processor.
Switch processes the data pursuant to the Controller’s instructions.
The Data Controller will decide what is collected and the lawful basis for collection, and the publisher will manage Data Subjects’ individual rights.
To find out what is collected, the lawful basis for processing, and how Personal Data is used, the website user should refer to the Privacy Policy on the website.
