We do not endorse any user Submission, and expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with user Submissions.
Xnxx does not permit copyright infringing activities or infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and will promptly remove content if properly notified of infringements on third parties' intellectual property rights.
Repeat copyright infringers will have their user access to the Website terminated.
Read about our repeat infringers policy here.
If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or other content infringes upon your rights, you may submit a takedown request with this form containing the following information:
an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and
a description identifying the material claimed to have been infringed and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and the location where the original or an authorized copy of the material exists (for example, the URL of the page of the website where it is lawfully posted; the name, edition and pages of a book from which an excerpt was copied, etc.); and
information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an electronic mail; and
a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material, in the manner complained of, is not authorized by its rightful owner, its agent, or the law; and
a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rightful copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner’s behalf.
==========
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your take down request may not be valid.
Please note that we regularly provide your name, contact information, as well as the contents of your takedown request to the person who posted the content you are reporting.
In the case that you are an authorized representative submitting a report, we provide the name of the organization or client that owns the right in question.
==========
The Counter-Notification Process
When a user’s video submission has been removed, the Website shall notify the user of this removal, including by providing the contact information of the person or entity sending the takedown request.
Pursuant to the Website’s repeat infringer policy, the user then has five (5) days to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown notice was sent in error.
The counter-notification may be sent to the Xnxx email address from which the user originally received the forwarded takedown request (c******@xvideos.com).
==========
For the Website to consider a user’s counter-notification, it must include the following:
A physical or electronic signature of the user; and
Identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available; and
A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
The user's name, address, and telephone number; and.
A statement that the user consents to the jurisdiction of the federal District Court for the judicial district in which the user is located, or if the user’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Website may be found; and
A statement that the user will accept service of process from the person who sent the notice of alleged infringement or an agent of such person.
Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be considered by the Website.
==========
Please note that we will send any complete counter-notifications we receive to the person who submitted the original takedown request.
That person may elect to file a lawsuit against you for copyright infringement.
If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will restore access to the removed materials.
==========
Until that time, your uploaded material will remain inaccessible.
We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked.
D.

You understand that when using the Website, you will be exposed to user Submissions from a wide variety of sources, and that Xnxx is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Submissions.
