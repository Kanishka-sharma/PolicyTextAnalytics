Privacy Policy
  The following policy outlines the types of information that we gather about 
  you and the way that way we use and don't use this information.
The information that we collect about our visitors falls 
  into three general categories: 
1.
Information You Provide to Us.
==========
We may collect 
  and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to 
  us either on the USATODAY.com site, via e-mail, or in any other way.
Some examples 
  of this type of information include the information you submit (such as your 
  name or e-mail address) when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests, 
  information that you post on message boards, and information contained in search 
  requests or questions you submit to the site.
If you decline to supply or provide 
  us with certain information, we may not be able to provide you with some services 
  that are dependent on the collection of this information.
2.
==========
Information that is Automatically Collected.
We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you 
  navigate through the USATODAY.com site.
For example, to enhance your experience 
  at USATODAY.com, we use a standard feature found in browser software called 
  a "cookie."
==========
Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard 
  drive for record-keeping purposes.
By showing how and when visitors use our 
  site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns.
==========
They also prevent you 
  from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of our site where 
  you have entered preference information before.
Another example of information 
  that we automatically collect as you navigate our site is information about 
  your computer's connection to the Internet.
This information allows us, among 
  other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure 
  traffic on our site.
3.
==========
Information from Other Sources.
USATODAY.com 
  may also obtain information about you from third parties or other sources and 
  may combine the information that we receive from them with information we have 
  already obtained about you.
How is the Information Used?
USATODAY.com uses the information it collects in a variety 
  of ways, including, using the information to customize features and advertising 
  that appear on the USA TODAY.com site.
==========
In addition, we may also provide third 
  parties with information about our visitors for a variety of reasons and purposes.
For example, we may provide our advertisers with information about our visitors 
  that will better target ads to specific types of visitors.
Therefore, we reserve the right to use and to disclose 
  to third parties all of the information that we collect about you and our other 
  visitors in any way and for any purpose, with one important exception.
==========
We will 
  not use the information that we collect, nor will we authorize third parties 
  to use the information that we collect, to mail or e-mail promotional offers 
  directly to you unless you have specifically informed us that you would like 
  to receive promotional offers from USATODAY.com and from third parties.
If you 
  choose to receive these promotional offers, then your information may be used 
  for direct mail or e-mail marketing.
You may view or update your preference 
  to receive these promotional offers by visiting registration.usatoday.com.
==========
Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily 
  disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through 
  e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be seen, collected and used 
  by others besides USATODAY.com.
USATODAY.com cannot be responsible for any unauthorized 
  third party use of information that you disclose online.
In addition, through USATODAY.com you will be introduced 
  to a variety of third-party vendors and sites, and to co-branded sites that 
  are brought to you by USATODAY.com and a third party.
For example, you can browse 
  content co-branded with the USATODAY.com logo that is hosted by a third party, 
  review the products offered by the vendors included in our "Shop.USATODAY.com" 
  section, there are contests and sweepstakes operated by third parties in which 
  you can participate, and you can click on advertisements for third party products 
  that appear on the USATODAY.com site.
The privacy polices of these co-branded 
  sites and third parties are not necessarily under our control.
The use of any 
  information that you may provide to any co-branded site or to any third party 
  may be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site that you are 
  visiting, which may differ from ours.
As well, in some cases these third parties 
  may share the information that they collect about you with USATODAY.com.
==========
If 
  you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing, 
  you should look for the privacy policy of the site that you are visiting via 
  a link from that site's home page or elsewhere.
If you cannot find that site's 
  privacy policy, or if you are uncertain about the entity to whom you are providing 
  your information, you should contact that site directly for more information.
Be aware that we may occasionally release information about 
  our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our 
  Terms of Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of 
  visitors to our sites, the public, or USATODAY.com.
==========
Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy 
  or sell various assets.
In the unlikely event that USATODAY.com, the bulk of 
  our assets, or our site is acquired by another company, information on our visitors 
  would be among the transferred assets.
==========
