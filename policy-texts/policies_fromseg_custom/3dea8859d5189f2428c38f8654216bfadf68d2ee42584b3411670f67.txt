Use of cookies on our websites
Cookies are small, unique strings of code stored on your computer that make it easier for you to use our site and help us improve site functionality and security.
==========
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).
We use our own proprietary cookies, as well as cookies hosted by third party vendors.
These cookies include non-personally identifiable information that allows advertisers and content owners provide a more customized web experience.
They may be used to tailor ad content on sites you may visit in the future.
==========
They may collect data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, and other clickstream data.
(These first-party cookies, targeted at our customers and site users, are different from the cookies we deploy through the ID5 service, which may capture browser data including but not limited to your IP address, browser version, OS type, etc.
We do not, however, collect information regarding clickstream, browsing behavior, or web page keywords.
To learn about these cookies please read the ID5 Platform Privacy Policy.
==========
When you visit our web sites or open an email you have received from us, we, or one of our technology vendors, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
These cookies, which do not contain personally identifiable information, enable us to customize our services and gather analytics about our web traffic.
Additionally, emails we send to you may contain a bit of code known as a “web beacon.”
This code helps us understand the time and date that a user has opened an email and when he/she has used a link within the email to visit a website, allowing us to collect analytics about our traffic and customize our services.
You can disable our web beacons by turning images “off” in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express).
Please see your email client for more information.
==========
We may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your computer when you visit our sites, and automatically store it in log files.
This may include the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
Your browser may permit you to reject or delete cookies, but this may prevent proper working of our website.
==========
We may disclose your personal data as follows:
We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
Disclosure to Vendors and other service providers
We may use third party service providers for network, security, email, and hosting services.
Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on our behalf, and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
==========
Disclosure required by law
Under certain circumstances personal data may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
Also when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request or to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
If we are ever legally compelled to disclose your personal data to a third party, we will notify you with the contact information we have unless doing so would violate the law or a court order.
Disclosure to Insurance

Other important information
Children’s privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal data about children.
Our systems are not designed for use by children under the age of 13.

==========
If you believe that this has occurred, please contact us at privacy@id5.io.
Security
We take the security of our data and client’s information seriously.
We always take what we believe are reasonable precautions to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and to prevent data from being disclosed to unauthorized parties.
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
==========
Business transitions
If we ever go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal data and non-personal data will likely be among the assets transferred.
You will be notified in advance by email where possible, and we will post a prominent notice on our website.
We will require an acquiring company or merger agreement to uphold the material terms of this privacy statement, including honoring requests for account deletion.
Data Transfers
Where business needs exist, ID5 intends to transfer personal data to entities outside the EU.
However, your personal data will not be transferred unless a valid transfer mechanism is in place legitimizing such a transfer.

Safeguards afforded by the EU model clauses may be accessed here.
