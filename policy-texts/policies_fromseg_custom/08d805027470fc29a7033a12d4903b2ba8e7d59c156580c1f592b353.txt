Under state law, motor 
                    vehicle, driver license, and vehicular crash records are subject 
                    to public disclosure.
The Driver Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) 
                    keeps your personal information private by limiting 
                    who has access to the information.
What kind of personal information does DPPA cover?
DPPA is designed to limit public access to your social 
                    security number, driver license or identification card number, 
                    name, address, telephone number, medical or disability 
                    information, and emergency contact information contained in 
                    your motor vehicle and driver license.
==========
What does DPPA not cover?
Under Subsection 119.0712(2) Florida Statutes: personal information 
              protected under DPPA does not include "driving violations 
              and driver's status," and vehicular crash records.
How can I obtain personal information from my own records?
==========
For example, how can I request my Florida driver license number?
You may request personal information from your own record by completing 
              and notarizing the Request 
              for Personal Information form.
Can I obtain personal information from other people's 
              records?
You can obtain personal information from other people's records 
              only if you meet one of the exemptions allowed by law.
These exemptions 
              are listed on the Request for Exempt Personal Information 
              form.
Who 
                      will still have access to my personal information?

How 
                      do I get Driver Privacy Protection?
The department 
                      automatically blocks personal information on your motor 
                      vehicle and driver license records.
Can I request 
                      personal information on my motor vehicle and driver license 
                      records be disclosed?
==========
Yes, you can print Request 
                    For Disclosure of Personal Information Form, write in 
                    the required information, and mail the form to the department.
This will unblock your personal information and allow anyone 
                    requesting motor vehicle, driver license, and vehicular crash 
                    records to obtain your personal information.
Can I subsequently 
                      request to withhold my personal information on my motor 
                      vehicle and driver license records?
Yes, you can print Request To Withhold 
              Personal Information Form, write in the required information, 
              and mail the form to the department.
This will again block your 
              personal information.
