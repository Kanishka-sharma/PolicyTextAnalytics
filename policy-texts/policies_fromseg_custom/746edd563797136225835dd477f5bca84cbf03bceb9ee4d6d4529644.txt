Governmental requests
Sweet-page.

==========
Any request or demand from any government (including the US) to deliver user data,will be thoroughly checked by our lawyers,and we will not comply unless the law which actually applies to us would undeniably require it from us.
And even in that hypothetical situation,we would refer to the fact we have no personal user data to share.
In the fourteen years we've been in business,we have never received such a request.
==========
The only legitimate way that we see to make us start collecting personal information,is if there is a valid warrant or court order,obliging us to do so in relation to a specific user because that person is suspected to have committed a crime which is serious enough to warrant such a restriction of privacy.
Given the strong protection of the right to privacy in Europe,European governments cannot just start forcing service providers like us to implement a blanket spying program on their users.
If that ever changed,we would fight this to the end.
Your privacy,our future
We strongly believe that we have the legal right to safeguard the privacy of our users by not collecting and/or encrypting their personal information,and to keep doing so.
