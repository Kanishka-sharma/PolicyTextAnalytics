When using or interacting with our websites and/or marketing emails (collectively with our websites, the “Online Properties“), we may collect certain information automatically from your device.
Some of this information, for example your IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device, and may therefore be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions in the European Economic Area and elsewhere.
Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology.”
Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, domain, referring website address, browser type and language and other technical information.

We refer to all of this information as “Digital Identifiers”.

==========
HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
to our group companies, third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our websites), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Policy or notified to you when we collect your personal information;

To find out more about our use of cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about you, as well as how to manage your preferences, please see our Cookie Policy.
==========
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA VISITORS ONLY)
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), such legitimate interests include: (i) improving our technology, websites, products and services; (ii) for our marketing activities; and (iii) measuring the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional campaigns.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact us” heading below.
==========
EUROPEAN DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
If you are a resident of a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use of information about you.
Specifically, you have the right to: (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.
In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please write to us at the contact details provided below or see our Data Subject Rights policy for instructions on how to do so: http://rubiconproject.com/terms-conditions/subject-access-request-policy/.
==========
You may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Rubicon Project by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of personal data with a European Data Protection Authority.
For contact details of your relevant local Data Protection Authority, please see here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
==========
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or making corrections to your personal information.
DATA TRANSFERS FOR VISITORS FROM THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA)
Rubicon Project is a global company headquartered in the United States with data centers located in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong.
If you are accessing any of our Online Properties from outside the United States, please be aware that your data may be transferred to, stored and processed by us and our affiliates in our facilities in the United States and other countries (including in Hong Kong, Brazil, Japan, Singapore and Australia, where our global affiliates have offices) and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information.
==========
These countries (including the United States) may not provide an adequate level of data protection for your personal information (as determined by the European Commission) or have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in your country.
We will however ensure that where Rubicon Project group companies or third party service providers receive personal information outside of the EEA, appropriate protections are in place under European data protection legislation.
For example, in order to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected when transferred outside of the EEA, The Rubicon Project Ltd. has entered into inter-company “model clause” agreements and other adequacy arrangements with other various entities located outside the EEA that may process your personal information on behalf of The Rubicon Project Ltd.
A copy of such agreements is available on request.
==========
SECURITY
We use industry-standard technical and organizational security measures to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems.
Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however, can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.
INFORMATION RETENTION
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
==========
The cookies set out on our device expire no later than 366 days after they were last accessed.
We typically store the personal information we collect, such as IP address and other information described above, for up to 90 days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
When we no longer need the personal information we collect, it is deleted from either the cookies or our servers (as applicable).
==========
We may keep personal information for longer periods of time where required under certain laws or to comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests – for example, those relating to corporate governance, taxation, money laundering and financial reporting legislation.
CHANGES
We may update this policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you of any material changes by posting the revised policy on this website, and where necessary, by any other means required by applicable law.
==========
THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or applications (including widgets) linked to or from our website nor the information or content contained therein.
Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our website.
