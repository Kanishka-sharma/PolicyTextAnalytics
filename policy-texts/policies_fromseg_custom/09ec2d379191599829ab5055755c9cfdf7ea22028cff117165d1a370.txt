Other / Unforeseen Cookies
To be able to place advertisements, our clients instruct us to use several third-party providers.
These parties use cookies as well.
This concerns the following categories of third parties:

Ad-serving providers: these are providers that make it technically possible to show you an advertisement.
Bid-exchange providers: these are marketplaces where the supply of advertisers and the demand of publishers meet.
Supply-Side Platform providers: these are providers that enable publishers to sell their available advertising space.
Due to the way in which Internet and websites work, it is possible that our clients cannot always have insight into the cookies that third parties place in connection with our client’s showing their ads.
This is particularly the case when such advertisements contain embedded elements such as texts, documents, images or film clips that are stored by another party, but that are shown on, in or through the advertisements.
Should you encounter cookies that fall into this category which we have not mentioned here above, please let us know.
Or contact the third party directly and ask which cookies they have placed, what the reason for this is, what the lifetime of the cookie is and in what way they have safeguarded your privacy.
Who is Data Shared With
Yieldr processes the advertising data for and on behalf of its clients.
Customers have access to this data and it is shared – at the request of the brand that is our client – with the following categories of third parties:
