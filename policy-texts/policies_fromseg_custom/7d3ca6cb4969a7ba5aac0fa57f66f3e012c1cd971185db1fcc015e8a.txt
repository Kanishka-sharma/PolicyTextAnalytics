This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information on how we collect and use data that might identify you.
Safeguarding your privacy is of paramount importance to us, we are active members of the iab (internet advertising bureau) and adhere to the EDAA principles.
We do our best to make sure that our policies and practices reflect industry best practice and constantly keep them in review.
We may change our Privacy Policy at any time, in which case you may want to visit this page from time-to-time to ensure you have read the latest version.
COOKIES AND WEB-BEACONS
This policy does not expressly deal with cookies and web-beacons and how we use them.
However, as privacy and personal data are linked; you may find it useful to read this document alongside our [cookie policy].
==========
INTERNET ADVERTISING
The Internet “works” because of advertising.
It is the way many websites generate the income they need to function.
Our main business is to place display advertising on behalf of companies and their brands (the advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space.
==========
Our aim is to make the advertising you see relevant and useful to you.
This is known as “behavioural advertising”.
To increase the relevance of the advertising we place, we use data that we have collected or have received to make informed predictions.
The less information we hold the more likely the advertisement we place will not be useful or relevant to you.
==========
Currently our industry uses cookies to ‘track’ the sites a browser has visited.
This does not identify you in that no one will know your name or address unless you have told them, but it might allow us to recognise the computer/tablet or other browsing device as one that we have ‘seen’ before.
When you visit a website on which we have placed an advert, your browser sends us its IP address.
We may then use publicly available databases to obtain an approximate location.
This is not precise of course.
We might be able to determine that you are in, say, a particular district of a city.
We use this information to decide, for example, what language the advert should be in or whether or not you might be interested in offers from a shop that is near that district.
==========
We use the IP Address, other information that a browser sends us both on their own and in conjunction with other publically available databases as a data processor under the law.
However there are times where we act as a data controller for advertisers.
In these cases the advertiser will give us data they hold and we will correlate that with our data in order, as always, to display relevant advertising to you.
Sometimes this data is (legally speaking) personal data in that it is technically possible to identify you as an individual by associating the information we have received with other sources.
Rest assured that we make no attempt to identify you personally and we do not retain the information given to us by the advertiser; we use it only in the way that they tell us and we are always assured that you have consented to this use.
We are firmly in favour of our industry’s rules on advertising to children.
As such, we do not use or collect data to target advertising to children under the age of 12 or those in sensitive groups, as defined by the data protection act.
CAN YOU TELL US NOT TO SHOW YOU BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING
Absolutely, Yes you can!
But to be clear, stopping behavioural advertising doesn’t mean you won’t see any advertising at all.
==========
An advert will still be placed, by us or someone else.
Where we are responsible for placing an advert, before we do so we look at the contents of one of the cookies that your browser sends us.
If the cookie does not exist or is set to an anonymous number then we can’t associate it with any other information and our prediction of what advertising will be of interest is based only on non-historic information (for example we will still be able to guess at your approximate location from the IP Address) and any information given to us by the advertiser.
But the advert will not behaviourally targeted.
For more information about how to delete cookies or opt-out of behaviourally targeted advertising, please refer to our [cookie policy].
WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT FROM OUR WEBSITE AND WHY
Browser Data
When you browse our site, whether you are logged in or not, your browser sends us information about it.
This includes the type of browser, operating system, whether javascript is supported, IP address and other similar information.
This data is not requested by us but is sent automatically by most browsers.
However, it is useful to us because based on this information we make decisions about what version of our site to show you (for example if your IP address indicates that you are in France, we might show you a French language version of the site).
==========
Your browser will also tell us if we have previously set a cookie on your computer.
This is important and we tell you more about cookies and the way that we use them in our [cookie policy].
This type of data is also useful to us in that we can analyse how you navigate our site.
i.e. which pages you visit and in which order.
==========
We can use this information to learn about the different ways people use our site and take decisions on how to improve it.
For example, if people are often going from one piece of content to another, but need to click on two links to get there, we might change the flow based on this information, to make the later content accessible by a single click.
Browser data does not necessarily identify you personally in that it does not provide us with your name or address etc; although if you are a registered user of the site (and are logged in), we will be able to associate this type of data with your registration details so that we can know more about how you, in particular, use our site and provide customisation for you.
Registration Data
When you register with our site you need to provide certain data, such as your name and email address.
We will also use your registration data to identify and communicate with you via our site.

We evaluate our security processes on an ongoing basis.
==========
