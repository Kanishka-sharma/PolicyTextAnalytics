Privacy Policy for Ask.com
Effective date: December 11, 2007

Internet privacy is an issue that Ask (“we” 
or “us”) takes very seriously.
We provide this Privacy Policy 
so that our users (“you”) will know what information is being collected about you and your activities on Ask.com, how that information is being used, and with whom it is being shared.
This Privacy Policy addresses these issues as well as additional issues that we believe may be of interest to you.
This Privacy Policy describes the online privacy practices for the Internet Domain Ask.com ( 
the “Sites”) and the various services (collectively, the 
“Services”) and software products (“Software”) we provide on or through the Sites.
By using one of the Sites, the Services or the Software or by providing any information using one of the Sites, Services or Software, you are agreeing to the collection and use of such information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share information, we will notify you by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Sites.
We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version.
The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made at the top of the page.
This Privacy Policy addresses the following issues: 
 

What types of information do we gather 
and how do we use it?
==========
How are cookies used on the Sites?
Do we use your information to deliver 
targeted online ads to you?
What information do we disclose to third parties?
What happens when you leave the Sites 
to go to other Internet sites?
==========
What is our policy regarding personally 
identifiable information from children under 13?
Do we take security precautions to 
protect your personal identifiable information?
Are there special considerations if 
you are visiting the Sites from outside of the United States?
==========
Whom can you ask if you have additional 
privacy-related questions?
What types of information do we gather and how 
do we use it?
Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either non personal information or personally identifiable information.
Non personal information is information that cannot by itself be traced back to a specific individual.
==========
For example, we know how many search queries we receive each day but we generally do not know the names and e-mail addresses of the persons submitting the queries.
Personally identifiable information is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, such as your name or email address.
Except as described below, we do not associate the non personal information we gather from you, including your search queries and IP address, with the personally identifiable information that you may submit to us.
For this reason, we do not consider your IP address to be personally identifiable information (unless and until such an association is made to respond to legal process (see Law Enforcement/Legal Requirements).
What anonymous information do we gather and 
how do we use it?
We collect non personal information, which is any information that is not personally identifiable.
==========
For example, each time you come to one of the Sites, we collect the limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit any website.
This information includes: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; and (e) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "How 
are cookies used on the Sites?"
below).
==========
Additionally, if you enter a search query through the Sites or Services, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, to return a search results page to you.
If you have installed our Software (or if you have otherwise modified your browser settings so that address bar search queries and erroneous domain name system (DNS) requests are submitted to us), we may also receive any search term or misspelled URL that you enter into your browser's address bar.
After a period of 18 months, we disassociate your query text data from your IP address.
==========
When AskEraser is enabled, all information described above is removed from our servers within a number of hours.
AskEraser cannot be enabled when you use a number of our Services or Software.
Also, if you use our services in violation of our Terms of Service, or in the case of a request from law enforcement, we may collect information about you even if Ask Eraser is enabled.

==========
In addition to collecting these types of information, we aggregate query information for internal reporting and targeted advertising.
We also count, track, and aggregate our visitors' activities into our analysis of general traffic flows at the Sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Sites, whether a user clicks on the initial search result, etc.).
All information about our users' search activity is evaluated only on a non personal (and generally only on an aggregated) basis, except in response to a customer service inquiry or legal process.
==========
When AskEraser is enabled, the search queries you submit will continue to count towards the total number of all queries received by the Site, but will not count towards the total number of any particular search term.
If you have installed one of our search toolbars, your use of such Software may send the following additional information to us: your IP address, your browser type, your default language setting, an identification of any button or menu item you selected or activated, and the text of any Web search query you enter into the toolbar.
(When you use our desktop search toolbar, we do not receive the text of any desktop search query unless you specify that you also wish to run that query as a Web search).
Since AskEraser is not enabled for toolbar queries, we will retain such additional information even if AskEraser is turned on, and will disassociate your query text data from your IP address after 18 months.
==========
We collect the above types of information to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including product monitoring, product improvement, targeted advertising, and monetizing commercially oriented search keywords.
Our Sites, Services and Software: 

 do not collect or report back to us  any information about other sites you visit on the Internet, except the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; 


 do not collect or "screen-scrape" any search queries or information that you provide to any other web sites; 


  do not serve pop-ups or other ads when you are on other websites; 


  do not collect or report back to us any data regarding your computer keystrokes (or other data) unrelated to the services the  Sites and Software provide.
What personally identifiable information do we gather and how do we use it?
Except as described below, the Sites, Services and Software do not collect any personally identifiable information about you.
In addition, we do not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to send you information about their products (nor for any other purpose, except to respond to legal process as described in this policy).
You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to use the Sites, Services or Software.
However, registration and full utilization of some of our Services does require that you provide certain personally identifiable information.
For example, some of the Sites and Services require that you to register for an account.
We ask you for some personal information in order to create an account (email address and a password for your account).
==========
If you have turned on AskEraser and try to submit personal information to create an account, you will be prompted with a pop-up to let you decide whether you would like to turn off AskEraser.
Other personally identifiable information you might provide could include your contact information if you participate in a promotion or sweepstakes, your email address if you submit a help request to us via email or respond to employment opportunities posted on the Sites.
The amount of such personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you, although access to or use of some Services may be affected if such information is not provided.
Since AskEraser does not apply to personally identifiable information you may submit to us, such information will be retained even if AskEraser is turned on.
We use your personally identifiable information to provide you personalized service, to ensure the smooth operation of the Sites and Services, to improve the Sites, Services and Software, and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms of Service for each Site and this Privacy Policy.
We also may use your personally identifiable information to contact you to respond to a request from you, if we believed we are compelled or otherwise obligated to do so as part of a legal proceeding, or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service.
Your search query information is not associated in any manner with your personally identifiable information, unless you have created a MyStuff account and have set your options to direct Ask to save your search history in your MyStuff account.
==========
Can you review, edit, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you online that we maintain?
To review, revise or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you online that we maintain, please log in to your profile and edit accordingly - Profile Page.
However, please understand that although this information, once deleted, is not available on the Sites, that information may remain stored indefinitely in our backup and archival records.

How are cookies used on the Sites?
The Sites use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags to track traffic flow and patterns of travel within and through the Sites.
Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information on a user's system.
Our Web server automatically asks a new user's browser whether it will accept our cookie file.
If the user's browser accepts our cookie, our Web server will record the cookie's unique ID for our use in internal reporting.
Every time the user returns to the Site, we will be able to read that cookie's ID number and can customize the services we deliver based on the user's past preferences.
We do not actively associate the cookie ID with any personally identifiable user information unless you have created a MyStuff account and have set your options to direct Ask to save your search history in your MyStuff account.
==========
The lifetime of our cookies is two years, after which all cookie information is automatically deleted from our servers.
However, the AskEraser cookie is set to expire after 30 years.
If you would like to remove our cookies from your computer, you can delete them using your browser (consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies.)
If you choose to decline or remove cookies, please note that you may not be able to use some of the interactive features offered on the Sites.
==========
When AskEraser is enabled, Ask will automatically delete cookie information from our servers within a number of hours.
AskEraser will however set a separate cookie to remind Ask to delete the data erased by AskEraser.
AskEraser cannot be enabled when you use a number of our Services or Software.

We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any personally identifiable information, and we do not disclose cookie information to third parties, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (see "What information do we disclose to third parties?"
below).
==========
We use third party advertisement serving companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites.
These companies may use information about your visit to the Sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags in connection to the Sites.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad serving company may collect from you.
These third party companies have their own policies as to record keeping and data retention.
Even when AskEraser is enabled, your search activity will not automatically be deleted from these third party company servers.

Do we use your information to deliver targeted online ads to you?
A targeted online ad is one we display to you based on the content of the pages you visit, any personal information you have provided to us, or keywords appearing in your search queries.
We do not directly provide any personally identifiable information to the advertiser when you interact with or view one of these targeted ads; however, advertisers (including ad serving companies) might indirectly obtain information on your interests in that they may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on their targeted ads meet the targeting criteria that the they specified when placing the ad.

What information do we disclose to third parties?
Third Party Service Providers.
Some elements on the Sites, such as news content, our Smart Answers, or the sponsored links advertising on our search results pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract.
In those cases, we may supply some information we gather from you to those third-parties so that they can provide those elements for display on the Sites.
Information that we may share with third parties is: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; (e) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us and (f) the search queries you submit.
For example, when you submit a query we transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our paid listing providers in order to obtain relevant advertising to display in response to your query.
==========
We may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers.
If you provide us with answers to voluntary survey questions, we may present this information to our advertisers and partners in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to such questions.
These third party companies have their own policies as to record keeping and data retention.
Even if AskEraser is enabled, your search activity will not automatically be deleted from the servers of these third party companies.
==========
Law Enforcement/Legal Requirements.
We may disclose your personally identifiable information as well as your IP address and other information to comply with court orders or subpoenas or when required to do so by law.
We also may disclose such information in compliance with a law enforcement or government request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, as necessary to render or conduct a legitimate business activity related to a service we provide, or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.
If you are using Ask Eraser, in some cases we may be required by law enforcement to retain your search data even when Ask Eraser is enabled, without alerting you.
Ask will carefully review all requests of this nature.
Corporate Restructuring.
We also may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger or other transfer of assets).

What happens when you leave the Sites to go to other Internet sites?
We do not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than the Sites.
When you are on the Sites, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.
For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a search result, the "click" may take you off of the Sites.
These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you.
We are not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data, that you may create when using such third party sites.
==========
We also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by us and selected companies.
In many cases, these co-branded services will contain the Sites' branding, but might not be hosted by us.
You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by," if our standard branding is not displayed on the top of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information.
==========
In such cases, you should follow the privacy link on the page to determine which company's privacy policy protects the information you enter on the page.
Even if the page is governed by a separate privacy policy, we might be entitled to receive information about what you do when using that service.
If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service.
We encourage you to read the privacy polices of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
When we enter into co-branding service relationships, we generally require the service provider to include a link to its applicable privacy policies and terms of service on the co-branded pages.

Do we take security precautions to protect your information?
We have security measures in place intended to assist in preventing unauthorized access to and in safeguarding personally identifiable information we collect online.
We seek to limit access to your personally identifiable information to employees who we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to perform their jobs.
Each of these people have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information.
Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secured; accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of any information provided to us in connection with the information that we collect online.
