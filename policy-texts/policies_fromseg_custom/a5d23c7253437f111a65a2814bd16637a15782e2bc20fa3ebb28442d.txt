A cookie audit provides you with vital information about how many cookies your website is setting on visitor's browsers and what they do.
It is an essential first step in making your website compliant with online privacy regulations.
If you haven't taken that step, you cannot inform site visitors or obtain their consent for cookies and other tracking technologies.
WIthout this, your website is breaking laws design to protect all UK and EU citizens, and you are risking enforcement action by regulators.
This could include fines of up to half a million pounds.
