  Salon.com Terms of Service
1.
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Salon.com (Salon) provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you.
==========
You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: http://www.salon.com/about/tos/index.html.
Your use of the Site constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, policies and notices (the "Agreement").
Different Salon services like Table Talk and The Well maintain their own Terms of Service which address the specific rules of those services.
2.
==========
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
Salon provides users with access to a rich collection of resources through its network of properties (the "Service").
The Service includes a full copy of the current Salon.com site and special content features.
Salon offers two ways of accessing its content, through a Premium membership or a Free Site Pass.
Salon Premium members at ad-free membership levels will not see banner, pop-up nor Site Pass advertising and will see a minimum of other advertising across Salon.
To view a list of exceptions please go to this page.
Ad-supported Premium members will see advertising across Salon.
==========
Free Site Pass access lasts for a variable period from 30 minutes to 8 hours.
Free Site Pass users will receive access solely to Salonï¿½s articles.
Free Site Pass users will see advertising across Salon and will need to watch an advertisement in order to get a Site Pass.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Salon properties, shall be subject to the TOS.
You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Salon assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.
==========
You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service by joining through Salon's registration page or opting into the Free Site Pass service and understand that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges).
You are responsible for those fees.
In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.
3.
==========
MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE
Salon reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
You agree that Salon shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.
Salon may change, add or remove any part of this Agreement, or any other terms associated with the use of the site, at any time, by posting a notice of such changes to the Terms of Service page of the Web site.
==========
Any changes shall become part of the Agreement and shall apply as soon as such a notice is posted.
By continuing to use Salon after the notice is posted, you are indicating your acceptance of those changes.
4.
==========
FEES AND PAYMENTS
Salon will charge you fees to become a Premium member.
In order to use the Service or designated portions of the Service you will be required to register and create an account.
You agree to pay all fees and charges, including applicable taxes, incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period in which such fees and charges are incurred.
==========
Salon reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any Fees, and to institute new Fees, effective upon prior notice to you.
In order to set up a Premium membership with Salon you must provide Salon with valid credit card information or a valid check or money order.
By submitting such credit card information, you give Salon permission to charge all Fees incurred through your account to the credit card you designate on the Registration Form.
All Fees (other than renewal fees) will be charged at the time they are incurred.
5.

You will be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.
You are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your Salon account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person authorized by you to use your member ID and password.

Members may opt to give gift memberships outside of that offer with a delayed delivery date.
6.
==========
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF MEMBERSHIP
Your right to use this site is personal to you and you may not sub-license, transfer, sell or assign this agreement to any third party without our approval.
Any attempt to do so will be void and may result in the cancellation of your account.
7.
==========
MEMBERSHIP RENEWAL AND CANCELLATION
Salon will automatically renew and charge your account upon every one-year or monthly anniversary of the date on which you joined depending on the membership plan that you selected during enrollment.
If you purchased a two-year membership with a credit card your account will be automatically renewed as a one year membership.
You give permission to Salon to automatically charge your membership fee to your credit card annually or monthly depending on your membership plan.
However, you may "opt out" of this automatic renewal at any time by visiting your Edit My Account page here and indicating your preference.
==========
Or, at any time prior to the end of the applicable billing period (month, year, every other year), you may give Salon notice by e-mail to premiumhelp@salon.com that you do not wish to renew your account.
Also, Salon will e-mail one and two year members approximately one month before such a renewal and give them the opportunity to cancel their memberships.
Salon will cancel your account upon receipt of such notification from you.
Please note that monthly members will not receive this e-mail.
==========
The renewal charge will be equal to your original sign-up price, except if you upgraded to another plan, had a two year account but renewed as a one year member or joined at a discounted rate.
For those joining at discounted rates, your renewal charge will revert to the regular price for the plan (with ads or without ads) you selected.
You may cancel a one or two year membership and receive a full refund if you make your cancellation and refund request to this e-mail address, premiumhelp@salon.com, within 30 calendar days from the day you signed up.
No refunds will be offered to 7 day trial members whose accounts have been charged.
You may cancel a monthly membership at any time but will not receive a refund for your membership fee.
No other refunds will be offered.
Refunds to members who opt to receive special offers like free books, magazines, CDs, the Powell's Books program and other services and items will be reduced by the amount of the retail price of, and shipping costs associated with, the special offer item.
==========
Free Site Pass user access to Salon will end 8 or fewer hours after the access was granted.
Free Site Pass users may occasionally, under certain conditions, take advantage of more than a single site pass but Salon reserves the right restrict site pass usage to a single pass per computer.
