International Data Transfer
							


							User Data, including any personal data therein, may be transferred to, stored at and processed by
							third parties in a country outside the EEA.
Users should be aware that the data protection and privacy regulations that apply in countries
							outside the EEA may not offer the same level of protection as provided for inside the EEA.
We require Users provide their consent to the storage, processing, and transfer of their User Data in
							and to countries outside the EEA.
We do this by requesting their consent to these practices in the
							notice that is displayed to them when they first use a Partner App containing the Ogury Product.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that such personal data wherever it is held or
							processed is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
Data security
							


							We seek to use appropriate organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect User
							Data within our organization.
Unfortunately, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed
							to be completely secure, and transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
==========
If a User has any reason to believe that their interaction with us is no longer secure, they should
							notify us of this problem immediately by contacting us at privacy@ogury.co



								Data retention
							


							We retain User Data we collect from you where we have your consent to do so.
If you withdraw your
							consent, we will either delete or anonymize your User Data.
Our retention period for User Data
							is 3 years, after this 3-year period all data is automatically deleted.
Customer support
							


							If, while using one of our Partner Apps, a User recognizes a problem with an Ogury Ad, they can
							notify us of the problem by contacting us via email at privacy@ogury.co.
We will ask for their email
							address and other contact information so that they can receive a response.

							If Users follow a link to any of third party websites via an Ogury Ad, please note that these websites
							have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these
							policies.
The links to third party websites or locations are for convenience only and do not signify
							our endorsement of such third parties or their products, content, or websites.
Ogury does not
