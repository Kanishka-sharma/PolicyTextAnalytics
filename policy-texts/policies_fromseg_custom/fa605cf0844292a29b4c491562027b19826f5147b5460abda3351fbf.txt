Information Use
If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may upon occasion send you E-mail offers.
We may use information you have given us to, for example, provide a service, measure consumer interest in our various services, or inform you about products and services.
These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, from surveys that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data.
We may also, upon occasion, share E-mail addresses with certain other well-established companies so that they can send you product and service offers that may be of interest.
==========
All offers are carefully developed to ensure that they meet our standards.
Our goal is to target offers to people who we believe will find them of value.
