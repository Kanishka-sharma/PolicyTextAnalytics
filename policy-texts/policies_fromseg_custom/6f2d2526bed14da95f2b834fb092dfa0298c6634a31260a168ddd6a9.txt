Privacy | Health and Data Segments
Undertone is a digital advertising company that may deliver advertisements to the websites you visit and applications you use.
Undertone understands that your online privacy is important to you.
We have created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect on this website and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites and applications owned by third-party publishers (collectively, the “Undertone Site Network”), how such information is used, and how it is shared with third parties, including our customers (referred to as “Advertisers”) if shared at all.
Please read this privacy policy carefully.
==========
Use of the Undertone Site Network, this website and your sharing of information with us is subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
By using the Undertone Site Network, this website or sharing information with us, you give your agreement to this Privacy Policy.
The Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time by us as further described below.
The terms “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to the website visitor or consumer.
The terms “Undertone,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Undertone, and the companies under its control (such as subsidiaries), or under common control (such as parent companies, or companies owned by its parent company) (collectively, “Undertone Entities”).
==========
Information We Collect
Ad Delivery & Reporting Across Multiple Sites; Corporate Websites
As part of our ad delivery and reporting, we log page views and collect information for the purpose of delivering ads or providing advertising-related services, including, without limitation, providing a specific advertisement based on a particular type of browser or time of day; statistical reporting in connection with the activity on a website or application; and tracking the number of ads served on a particular day to a particular website or application.
To do so, we collect certain technical information about an end user when they interact with our services including the type of device, browser, mobile application and operating system used including the particular version or model and certain configurations and settings, non-precise geographical location (through IP addresses and regional data), device identifiers such as IDFA for IOS and the Advertising ID for Android, ISP (Internet Service Provider) and ISP location, as well as the domain name or details of the application, day and time of visit, and page(s) visited.
We do so across multiple web domains and applications owned or operated by different entities (each, a “Site”).
Undertone may also collect this information when you are visiting the Undertone corporate site or any website within the Undertone Site Network.
==========
Relevant Advertising
We want to deliver more relevant advertising to you.
Delivering more relevant advertising to you and other visitors allows owners of website and applications to generate more advertising revenue.
This revenue pays for the free content that they may publish for you, or free services that they may deliver to you.
It also means that you are more likely to see online advertising that meets your interests.
In an effort to deliver relevant advertising to you, we collect data across multiple web domains and applications owned or operated by different entities to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in advertising online (“Interest-Based Advertising” or “IBA”) such as the web pages you visit or applications you use, the content you see, access and utilize on such web pages and applications; for example, offerings and advertisements that you view, use and access, how you use them and your response to them (ie.
==========
clickstream data), how frequently and when you use them.
For example, we can analyze data to determine that a visitor of a particular site at 6:30PM is more likely to be interested in pizza, or antique cars, or a classic movie.
We can then serve an ad to the web page the visitor is viewing that offers a discounted pizza, car show tickets, or classic movie DVD—importantly—without ever knowing the identity of the visitor.
==========
If you do not wish to benefit from relevant advertising, please feel free opt out IBA as described in the paragraph titled “IBA _Opt-Out”, below.
Internet Technology
We, our advertising partners and certain technology vendors, collect the information described above by using log files, pixels or web beacons and cookies.
We often engage or cooperate with service and technology companies to collect this information.
While this tracking and collection technology is commonly used, you might not be familiar with it, and we would like to explain it:
“Log files” track actions occurring on websites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.
==========
“Pixels” or “Web beacons” are electronic files or tags that reside on web pages and applications and are used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.
“Cookies” are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, tablet, or mobile device).
Cookies are mostly used to record what pages and ads you have already viewed.
Cookies are used to facilitate website navigation (for example, so your bank knows that you logged in), make sure that you are forwarded to the appropriate website when you click on an ad, and generally improve your web browsing experience.
Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.
==========
We also use cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display.
You can learn more about cookies on the Internet Advertising Bureau’s website: http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
In the mobile environment, we use device identifiers such as the IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers used in IOS) and the Advertising ID (Identifier for Advertisers used in Android) in the same way as we use cookies to identify your device for IBA purposes.
==========
In addition to the uses set forth below, our primary use of the information we collect is for marketing and advertising purposes, to determine which ads perform well, to better match ads and website content to your interests, to assist us in improving the operation of our services, to maintain the quality of our services, to enhance our services to our business partners and clients, to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Undertone’s services, and for the other purposes described below.
Personally Identifiable Information

These circumstances can include as part of an advertising campaign (eg.

Examples of such Customer Forms include, but are not limited to: registration forms to access Undertone published white papers or Undertone produced webinars, and forms providing customer contact information when requesting information from Undertone.
Such information will only be used to provide you with support services and contact you in connection with the services we provide.
Customer Forms are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18 or those who are not residents of the United States.
If you are not 18 years of age or you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not provide us with any information or use any of the Customer Forms.
==========
Notwithstanding, in certain jurisdiction such as the European Union, some of the information that Undertone collects and uses as a necessary part of providing advertising services (including for IBA) may be considered personal data, such as IP address, device IDs, online identifiers or user profiles.

We license and otherwise obtain data from various other companies, including research companies, data aggregation companies, data management platforms, cross device vendors and other third party companies.
Data sets may include information about you or your demographic segment that such companies have licensed, purchased or collected.

To the extent the information is personal data including PII, we process this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including, amongst others, in relation to the stated purposes of processing (which may include the use of automated decision-making algorithms and processes), data retention, cross border transfers, your rights to the data and the right to lodge complaints.

While Undertone strongly encourages its advertising customers, service providers, partners, and members of the Undertone Site Network to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Undertone is not responsible for the information practices of any of third party entities referenced in this Privacy Policy, which may use the information we share with them for the same purposes as we use the information, or for their own independent purposes.
The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.

In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information is treated, transferred, or used.
