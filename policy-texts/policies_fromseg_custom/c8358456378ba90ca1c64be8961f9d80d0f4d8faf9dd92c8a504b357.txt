PRIVACY POLICY
Effective: Feb. 19, 2014
The Trade Desk (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is an online advertising and technology platform headquartered in the United States.
We provide this privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform (“Technology”) processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our services (our “Clients”).
This policy also outlines our privacy practices for our corporate website, which is located at www.thetradedesk.com (the “Website”).
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@thetradedesk.com.
==========
The Trade Desk runs a buying platform for media and data.
The Trade Desk Technology allows our Clients to buy ad space on websites for online advertising and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that media.
When ad space on a website is bought or sold (usually to an advertiser or ad agency by a web publisher) the Technology, as an agent for its Clients, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet users who visits that site.
Generally, an Internet user’s computer comes into contact with The Trade Desk when a user views an ad, or visits a website, delivered or serviced by or with our Technology.
Serving users relevant advertising is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising or online behavioral advertising, “OBA”.
==========
PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY
Information Our Technology Does and Does Not Collect
Our Technology collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”), including, but not limited to, your IP host address, the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer’s operating system.
We may also collect Non-PII from Clients or other third parties.
The following is PII that we do NOT collect:
We do not collect “personal information”, as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), from users we have actual knowledge are under the age of 13 or from sites directed to children under the age of 13 for OBA, nor do we engage in OBA directed to children we have actual knowledge are under the age of 13 except as compliant with the COPPA.
The Trade Desk also does not collect or use financial account numbers, Social Security numbers, pharmaceutical prescriptions, or medical records about a specific individual for Online Behavioral Advertising.
How We Use Information Our Technology Collects
The Trade Desk uses Non-PII to target and serve relevant advertising to consumers and to perform attribution analysis or other analytics regarding advertising audiences.
Our Technology does NOT use any PII to serve advertisements to consumers, and we do not sell any of your PII.
==========
Cookies and Web Beacons
In order to help make the online advertisements more relevant to users, our Technology uses the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on users’ computers about users’ visits to certain websites.
We also use cookies to understand users’ browsing and buying activities so that we can measure the success of online advertising campaigns we run.
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website.
Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user visits a website or views an advertisement.
Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics.
This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, making the website easier to use, measuring the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailoring their website (including the ads and offers they receive) to better match a user’s interests and preferences.
The cookies placed by our Technology cannot be used to access any other data on a user’s hard drive, or to personally identify them.
Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive.
==========
The Trade Desk cookie is set to expire after one year, this expiration is a sliding window, meaning it resets itself after any interaction occurs.
The Trade Desk also uses web beacons (also known as 1×1 gifs), along with cookies, to determine if a user has visited a particular website.
These beacons aid in providing more relevant advertising to the user, as well measuring the success of an advertising campaign, but provide no personally identifiable information.
==========
Opt-Out From Our Cookies
If you’d like to opt-out from having The Trade Desk collect your Non-PII in connection with our Technology, please click here.
When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.
The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor our online advertising campaigns.
Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
Please also note that if you choose to disable this function, your online experience may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data and advertising partners.

The security of your information is important to us.
The Trade Desk has implemented reasonable security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that our Technology collects, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.
