As a result, we'll work hard to move information, products and services that best fit your profile to the front of your browsing experience.
You can browse our sites anonymously by choosing not to provide us with any personally identifiable information, such as your name or e-mail address, during your visits to our sites.
Browsing anonymously after you've identified yourself involves setting your browser to disable cookies and similar files or by deleting the cookies and similar files that you have accepted from us.
To do this, you'll need to follow your browser's instructions for disabling cookies or deleting cookies.
Please note that the use of certain online products, such as Online Banking, do require the acceptance of cookies or similar files.

Aggregation sites are Internet sites that allow you to consolidate account information from several sources to be viewed on one site.

If you decide to revoke the authority you have given an aggregator company, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America password to ensure that the aggregator company cannot continue to access your account.
==========
Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) P3P 
The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project, has been developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to help inform Internet users about the information practices of Web sites they visit.
Using the P3P standard, a Web site can publish a summary of site privacy practices in machine-readable form.
This summary is interpreted by browsers equipped to read P3P summaries.
These browsers may then display alerts or block transmission of information to you and/or the Web site if the Web site privacy practices are different from the privacy practices you've selected in your P3P browser.
Only a P3P-enabled browser used on a Web site that publishes a P3P privacy practices summary will let you see these alerts or block certain information from being transmitted.
==========
Bank of America sites use P3P summaries to address our use of cookies, but do not publish a full P3P summary of our privacy policy.
However, you can read, print or download the full text of the Bank of America Privacy Policy for Consumers online.
See a list of recommended browsers for using Bank of America Web site.
We may provide links to non-Bank of America companies, such as credit bureaus or merchants.
==========
If you choose to link to Web sites not controlled by Bank of America, we are not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability of their information.
If you are asked to provide information on one of these Web sites we strongly urge you to carefully study their privacy policies before sharing your information.
When you are leaving the Bank of America site, you will be notified that you are leaving the site and that Bank of America cannot guarantee the security of the site you are entering and that the site may have different privacy practices and protections.
==========
E-mail can be used for sending scams such as a false offer from a company or an alert to a false computer virus.
These e-mails are often forwarded with good intention by friends, adding an erroneous level of legitimacy.
If you receive an e-mail that you think could be a scam, do not forward it and delete it immediately.
If you receive an e-mail warning that a new computer virus is circulating, check the Web site of any one of the well-known anti-virus software companies for validation.
==========
Emails such as these are most likely from criminals who send thousands of emails at a time to random addresses.
These criminals are trying to entice the recipient to visit a phony website and provide personal and confidential information, such as online IDs and passcodes, or Social Security numbers and account numbers.
Although the site may look like a bank's, it is not - which is why this practice is known as "spoofing."
To report a suspicious email that uses Bank of America's name, you can forward it to abuse@bankofamerica.com
We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under 13 without parental consent.
==========
We recognize that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.
While Bank of America works to protect your personal information, you also have responsibility.
Learn how to protect your information.
==========
Internet safety for children.
The Internet is a public network.
Children's access to the Internet can allow them to visit inappropriate Web sites and be exposed to unwanted risks.
==========
COPPA, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, protects children under the age of 13 from the online collection of personal information.
Learn more about COPPA on the Federal Trade Commission's Web site.
Parents can be proactive by installing filtering software that gives them more control over their family's Internet experience.
Cyber ethics for children.
Cyber ethics is the practice of being a good citizen on the Internet superhighway.
==========
Kids should understand the rules of the road, too.

Changes to the Online Practices Privacy Policy 
If we make changes to the Online Practices Privacy Policy or make any material changes to our online services, we will revise the Online Practices Privacy Policy to reflect such changes and revise the policy's effective date.
