==========
An NBA.com user may change or update his or her personal information at any time by visiting the registration area.
NBA.com uses "cookie" technology.
Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Such technology is an industry standard and is used by most major Web sites.
==========

If a user does not want information collected throught the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., myNBA personalization) available on NBA.com.
NBA.com tracks certain general usage pattern information, including what pages people visit and how long they have been registered users.

With whom the information may be shared

Once again, NBA.com will not provide any personally identifiable information, other than to its affiliates, about you to advertisers or other partners without your consent.
As stated above, NBA.com may, however, provide advertisers and/or other partners with anonymous aggregated information about our users to illustrate trends and patterns.
All third parties with whom we share such information will have independent privacy and data collection practices and NBA.com has no responsibility or liability for their policies or actions.
We will never give out any information linking your real name to your screen name unless you authorize us to do so, or unless required to do so by law.
NBA.com has several partners that can offer valuable products and services to our members.
From time to time, NBA.com may give or sell a list from our database of users to these third party vendors.
These lists will consist of only those users that have "opted in" to receiving special offers and promotions during the initial registration process.
NBA.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that every marketing offer sent to an NBA.com user as a result of the provision of such information contains a link for that user to no longer receive such offers.
==========
In addition, we may share your information with a company that acquires all or substantially all of NBA.com's assets or in a merger or acquisition, but only if such company agrees to abide by this Privacy Policy.
While NBA.com is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible for content on our own site.
All third parties associated with NBA.com (including, but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices.
==========
NBA.com does not control this collection of information and is neither responsible nor liable for their independent policies or actions.

The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control

NBA.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control.
The servers for NBA.com are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility.
Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by regularly backing up data, performing consistency checks with independently recorded log files to prevent tampering, and restricting access to information on our servers via several user authentication technologies.
==========
Our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol.
When you place an order on the site and your credit card information is transmitted, you will connect with our secure server.
SSL sends your browser information that encrypts your order, changing all the information that you send back into a code that is extremely difficult to decipher.
==========
Only those employees needed to carry out the business functions will have access to information on individual NBA.com customers.
We train each such employee with respect to the NBA.com Privacy Policy, and those violating these policies will be subject to disciplinary action.
It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties.
==========
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
In addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials if we determine such disclosure to be appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by court order or operation of law.
Your myNBA personalization account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the user information relevant to your account.
==========
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
At no time will any NBA.com employee or company representative ask for your password via e-mail.
If you ever receive such an inquiry, please notify NBA.com immediately at userservices@NBA.com.
==========
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your screen names, passwords and/or other account information.
Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others.
If users post personal information that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk.
Users accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
7.
==========
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information

You will also have the option to correct any inaccuracies in your myNBA personalization account or other registration by returning to the registration area and updating your profile and preferences.
If a username and password is required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration information.
If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and requesting it to be sent to you at the e-mail address you originally provided during registration.

NBA.COM NOTE TO PARENTS


It is NBA.com's policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from children.
A number of interactive features on NBA.com require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, myNBA personalization).
All registrants will be required to enter their full name, age, zip code and e-mail address.
==========
In some cases, users will be required to select a special user name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password.
If NBA.com determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on NBA.com, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information.
Any personally identifiable information that the child may have attempted to enter during the registration process will not be collected or maintained by NBA.com.
Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on NBA.com that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes).
==========
NBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on NBA.com.
Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
Features that permit registration by children under 13 years old include NBA official fantasy games (e.g., Virtual GM, Pick 'N' Roll, Draft Challenge) hosted by ESPN.com or Smallworld.com, chatrooms hosted by Yahoo.com, and message boards hosted by Prospero.com.
==========
Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the websites on which registration occurs.
For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.
NBA.com does not knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 years old.
