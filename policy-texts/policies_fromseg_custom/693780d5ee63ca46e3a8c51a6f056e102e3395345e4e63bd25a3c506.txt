Enable referrer logging
It is common practice for Web sites to refer to each other, and indeed many Web sites behave
differently according to which page you were referred from.
Disabling this option will prevent this
kind of logging.
Enable automatic redirection
Ever so often, a Web page will redirect you to another Web page when
you go to it.
This may take more time than you're willing to commit, so Opera allows you to turn this feature off.
==========
Use cookies to trace password protected documents
Opera will remove all refererences to secure pages (HTTPS://) and forms that have been used to transport passwords 
during your Opera session upon exit (e.g. cookies).
If this option is checked, cookies that are manipulated by other 
cookies that are set by secure pages and forms that fall into the above category, are tagged as, and treaded in the 
same manner as the cookies that are removed upon exit and subsequently removed, in order to provide you with the highest 
possible level of security.
One thing that seems to be very much in the eyes of the specialist media as well as on the mind 
of many users is the "security" hole of cookies.
==========
Actually, cookies are small text files that store 
information you have given about yourself to identify you on the Internet, or to store your settings for 
a site, set by servers for servers to reclaim, and are nowhere near as dangerous as they are sometimes 
portrayed.
However, they can used to collect information about your Internet usage 
pattern, and can therefore be a grave invasion of privacy if used in this way, particularly in the way 
they are set by servers.
Opera has a built-in cookie filtering facility, the settings of which are changed in this part of
the menu.
The first drop down menu will let you select one of the following options:
Automatically accept all cookies: Accepts cookies regardless of who sets them and
where they are referred.
Accept only cookies from selected servers: 
Use this to accept cookies from the servers you select.
Display received cookies: If this is selected, each and every cookie that is sent to
Opera will display in an accept/reject dialog box.
Don't accept cookies: All cookies received will be discarded.
==========
The second drop-down menu applies to all the settings except for "Do not accept cookies".
It sets the
handling of cookies to:
Only accept cookies for the server: Which will accept all cookies set by the active
server for the active server or by other servers for themselves, inside of the domain.
Don't accept third party cookies: Does not accept cookies that are set by third parties
to apply to the active server or other servers in the domain.
==========
Display third party cookies: This option will accept all cookies that are set by the server 
for the server or by the domain for the domain in the manner which is selected in the box above, but will 
prompt you for action when Opera receives a cookie from a third party.
Accept from any servers: 
Accept all cookies from all servers.
Cookie server filters
Cookies received are automatically filtered unless you have them set Opera to automatically accept
all cookies or disable all cookies.
These are the cookie filters:
Accept from server: The servers that are listed here are servers you will accept cookies
from.

servers.
Enter the name of the server, e.g. www.microsoft.com or www.netscape.com
into the box to the far bottom of the menu and press the "Add" button to add the server to the list.
Again, servers on this list can be removed by highlighting them and clicking the "Remove" button.

www.badserver.com in the box to the far bottom and press the "Add" button to add them to the list.
If you change your mind, you can press the "Remove" button to remove the cookie.
Refuse third party from domains: 
Likewise, mistrusted third party servers may be defined in this box so that your Opera copy will always accept 
cookies set to other domains from the domains defined here.
==========

or .
baddomain.com in the box to the far bottom.
The "Add" button will place the domain in the list field.
Domains can be removed from this box by highlighting them and pressing the "Remove" button.
==========
Allow illegal paths: 
Cookies that are set with illegal paths may be considered an invasion of privacy, or at least they 
may not work as intended.
This option will allow illegal pathed cookies regardless.
Refuse illegal paths: 
The previous option would allow cookies with paths illegal path statements, but it you want the 
exact opposite, Opera will let you refuse cookies with illegal paths.
==========
This is what you should select 
then.
The three remaining options in this part of the "Network" menu are:
Throw away new cookies on exit: There are times when you may have to accept cookies from
servers that you do not particularly want to accept cookies from.
In order to avoid having to keep
these cookies longer than needed, enable this option is to discard of the cookies when you exit
Opera.
Display warning for illegal domains: 
If checked, Opera will display a warning dialog if a server wishes to set a cookie to your 
system for a top level domain, such as .
==========
com, .
org or .
org, which 
is not a "legal" way of setting cookies.
==========
Display warning for illegal: 
If checked, Opera will display a warning dialog if a server wishes to set a cookie to your 
system that has a wrong path statement on where it is set to be allowed.
