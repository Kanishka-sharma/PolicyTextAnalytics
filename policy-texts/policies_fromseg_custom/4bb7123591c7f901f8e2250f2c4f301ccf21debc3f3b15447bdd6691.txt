==========
Cross-Device and Cross-App Targeting
Our clients and partners may use Other Information that we share with them to establish connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes.
They may match your devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or web browsers, or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household.
This means that information about your use of websites or applications on your current browser or device may be combined and used with information from your other browsers or devices.
For example, this allows advertisers to deliver ads to you on your tablet based on activities you engaged in on your smartphone.
==========
To opt out of cross-device targeting practices, please follow the instructions in the section below titled “Opting Out of Cross-Device Targeting.”
Our clients and partners also may use Other Information about your activity across multiple, unaffiliated third-party mobile applications for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes.
For example, if you use a travel app, these third parties may display travel-related ads to you on another, unrelated app.
To opt out of cross-app targeting practices, please follow the instructions in the section below titled “Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising for Mobile Advertising Identifiers.”
==========
Disclosure of Other Information
We may disclose Other Information:
among our affiliates (identified in the second paragraph of this Privacy Policy) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;
to our client publishers to allow them to analyze the effectiveness and performance of our services and to offer targeted ad inventory to our media buyer clients;
to our media buyer clients to allow them to make decisions regarding buying advertising inventory on our publisher clients’ websites, other websites, and applications, and to analyze the effectiveness and performance of their advertising campaigns via our services, including sharing your device’s physical location to enable our media buyer clients to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns;
to our third-party service providers who provide services that enhance our services;
to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings); and
as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location).
If we combine any Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personally Identifiable Information as long as it is combined.
We will not use PII merged with previously-collected Other Information for Interest-based advertising purposes without your opt-in consent.
Retention of Other Information
We retain Other Information that we collect for purposes of serving targeted advertisements to you (including the segment information that we receive from third parties) for up to 90 days from the last date that we received any of your user data.
==========
We retain impression information for up to six months.
We retain raw ad server logs for our mobile ad server business for up to 9 months.
We use precise geolocation for the specific ad impression to which the geolocation relates, after which the geolocation information is aggregated with other geolocation data for use by us for analytical purposes.
If we de-identify Other Information we collect in connection with targeted advertising purposes, we may retain that information, in an aggregated format, indefinitely.
In such cases, we commit to not re-identifying the information.
