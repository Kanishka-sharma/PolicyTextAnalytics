To whom does this Privacy Statement apply and what does it cover?
==========
This Privacy Statement applies to Deloitte Tax LLP (also referred to as “Deloitte Tax”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), an entity within the Deloitte Network.
As used in this Privacy Statement, the “Deloitte Network” refers to one or more of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, a UK private company limited by guarantee (“DTTL”), its network of member firms and their related entities.
DTTL and each of its member firms are legally separate and independent entities.
Please see deloitte.com/about for a detailed description of the legal structure of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited and its member firms.
==========
This Privacy Statement sets out how we will process your personal information as part of our provision of tax, social security and (in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States) immigration related services as may be relevant to you.
Deloitte Tax is providing these services either under a direct contract with you or via a contract with another person (such as a company or a partnership or a trustee) who has asked us to provide the services.
Your personal information will be protected and handled with consideration for its confidentiality and Deloitte Tax will only disclose it as set out in the “To whom will we disclose your personal information?”
==========
section below.
In this Privacy Statement, we refer to handling, collecting, protecting and storing your personal information as "processing".
What personal information do we collect?
Deloitte Tax may collect personal information relating to you such as:
name
contact details (such as work or home address, email and phone numbers)
date of birth
government identifiers (such as social security number and passport details)
financial information
calendar data (where applicable)
In order to provide services to you, Deloitte Tax may receive and also need to process personal information about you that may be considered special category (or “sensitive”) personal information (special category personal information is considered to include information about your health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data or sexual orientation).
==========
Special category personal information about you includes information that may be reasonably inferred from other information that we receive.
Where we receive special category personal information or other information from which special category personal information can be reasonably inferred, we will require explicit consent in order to process it.
How do we collect personal information?
Deloitte Tax may collect personal information about you in different ways:
you may provide it directly to us
we may obtain it because of the services that Deloitte Tax provides or has previously provided
we may receive it from other members of the Deloitte Network or from third parties, such as your employer/partnership, or a tax authority and/or other relevant authority/administrative bodies
we may observe or infer it from the information you provide to us and/or the way you interact with us
This personal information can be received in any manner, including in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or other written communications.
Without access to all the personal information that we need, we may be unable to provide or complete the services.
==========
Where another party (such as a company or a partnership or any third parties acting on your or their behalf) provides your personal information to us, they must also comply with their obligations under the relevant privacy laws and regulations.
If you believe that the entity for whom you work or a third party has not provided you with details of the personal information that it holds about you and/or has not obtained your authority to provide us with that personal information for processing as described in this Privacy Statement, then please contact such entity directly.
Disclosing personal information to us relating to third parties
If any personal information which you provide to us relates to any third party, for example a spouse or civil partner, individuals (including children) who depend on you financially, or a joint account holder or a beneficiary or trustee of a trust, then by providing us with their personal information you will need to ensure that you have obtained any necessary permissions from those persons to the use of their personal information in the way set out in this Privacy Statement, or you are otherwise permitted to give us this personal information.
==========
You should share a copy of this Privacy Statement with those other individuals before disclosing any personal information about them to us.
How do we use your personal information?
==========
Deloitte Tax processes personal information about you to:
establish or maintain our relationship with you
provide services to you and/or family member(s) or to the entity that has engaged us to provide the services
We may also use your personal information for the purposes of, or in connection with:
compliance with applicable legal, regulatory or professional requirements
protecting our rights and/or property
On what basis do we process personal information about you?
This Privacy Statement sets out the grounds upon which we rely in order to process your personal information.
We may use your personal information for the purposes outlined above because:
(a) where relevant, we have a contract with you to provide services and processing your personal information is necessary for the performance of such contract;

provide services to you and/or to the entity that has engaged us to provide the services;
support the management of our client engagements;
evaluate, develop or improve our services or products; or
protect our business interests.
or (c) we are subject to legal, regulatory or professional obligations.
To whom will we disclose your personal information?
In connection with one or more of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement, we may disclose your personal information to:
other members of the Deloitte Network
those with whom you have requested us to share information, such as your spouse or civil partner
competent authorities, including courts and authorities regulating us or another member of the Deloitte Network, in each case to comply with legal, regulatory or professional obligations or requests
vendors and administrative, support, infrastructure and other service providers handling your information on our behalf; in each case, such vendors and service providers will be contractually bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations consistent with the obligations in this Privacy Statement
third parties to whom we disclose information in the course of providing services to you or to the entity that has engaged us to provide the services
Deloitte Tax does not sell or lease your personal information to others.

In such cases, adequate safeguards will be in place to protect your personal information.

How do we keep your personal information secure?
We have in place reasonable commercial standards of technology and operational security to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Only authorised personnel, with appropriate awareness of privacy obligations, are provided access to your personal information.
==========
How long will we keep your information?
We retain personal information as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement or (i) as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable laws or professional standards, or (ii) as long as the period in which litigation or investigations might arise in respect of our services.
==========
What are your rights in relation to your personal information?
You have various rights in relation to your personal information.
In particular, you have a right to:
obtain confirmation that we are processing your personal information and request a copy of the personal information we hold about you
ask that we update the personal information we hold about you, or correct such information that you think is inaccurate or incomplete
Depending on the jurisdiction in which you are located, you may also have the right to:
ask that we delete personal information that we hold about you, or restrict the way in which we use your personal information
withdraw consent to our processing of your personal information (to the extent our processing is based on your consent)
ask us to stop or start sending you marketing messages at any time
obtain and/or move your personal information to another service provider
object to our processing of your personal information
Where our processing of special category personal information is reliant on your consent and you withdraw that consent, we will cease processing the relevant information for the purposes of providing our services and the effect may be that we are no longer able to provide the services.
However, we may still retain a copy of the relevant information for as long as necessary to comply with applicable laws or professional standards, or as long as the period in which litigation or investigations might arise in respect of our services.
