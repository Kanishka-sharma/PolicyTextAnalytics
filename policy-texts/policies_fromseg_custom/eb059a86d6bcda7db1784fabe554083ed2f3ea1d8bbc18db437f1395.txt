Site performance cookies
This type of cookie remembers your preferences for tools found on the Guardian's website, so you don't have to re-set them each time you visit.

Anonymous analytics cookies:
Every time a user visits our website, web analytics software provided by a third party generates an anonymous analytics cookie.
These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before.
Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies, and if you don't, we generate new ones.
This allows us to track how many individual unique users we have, and how often they visit the site.
Unless you are signed in to the Guardian, these cookies cannot be used to identify individuals; they are used for statistical purposes only.
If you are logged in, we will also know the details you gave to us for this, such as username and email address.
Geotargetting cookies
These cookies are used by software which tries to work out what country you are in from information supplied by your browser when it requests a web page.
This cookie is completely anonymous, and is only used to help target content - such as whether you see our UK our US home page - and advertising.
==========
Registration cookies
When you register with the Guardian, we generate cookies that signal whether you are signed in or not.
Our servers use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in with, and if you are allowed access to a particular service.
It also allows us to associate any comments you post with your username.
If you have not selected 'keep me signed in,' your cookies get deleted when you either close your browser or shut down your computer.
==========
While you are signed into either of the sites, we combine information from your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to identify which pages you have seen on the Guardian as an individual,
Advertising cookies
These cookies allow us to know whether or not you've seen an advert or a type of advert, and how long it is since you've seen it.
We also use cookies to assist in targeted advertising.
We may use cookies set by a third party to more accurately target advertising to you, to show, for example, adverts about holidays to users who have recently visited the travel section of our site.
==========
These cookies are anonymous - they store information about the content you are browsing, but not about who you are.
We also set anonymous cookies on certain other sites that we advertise on.
If you receive one of those cookies, we may then use it to identify you as having visited that site if you later visit the Guardian, and will serve targeted advertising based on this information.
Third party advertising cookies
A lot of the advertisements you see on the Guardian are generated by third parties.
Some of these third parties use their own anonymous cookies to track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many people have seen it more than once.
==========
The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies, and the Guardian has no access to read or write these cookies.
These third party advertising cookies may be used by those third parties to anonymously target advertising to you on other websites, based on your visit to the Guardian.
Other third party cookies
On some pages of the Guardian's website, third parties may also set their own anonymous cookies, for the purposes of tracking the success of their application, or customising the application for you.
Because of how cookies work, the Guardian's website cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by the Guardian's website.
For example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on the Guardian, the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this.
==========
