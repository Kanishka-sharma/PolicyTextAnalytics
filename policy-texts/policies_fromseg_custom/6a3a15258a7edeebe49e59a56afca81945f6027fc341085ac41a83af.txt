What we collect, why, and how we use it
At TMT we take the security of personal information very seriously.
We have established industry best practice security measures designed to ensure personal information is safeguarded and accessed by those only with a need to know.
==========
We collect personal information directly from our customers in connection with the use of TMT Services.
The Services collect information from our customer’s digital properties, and that information is used to facilitate the delivery of our Services to our customers, including monitoring the assets, providing support, and for TMT’s own analytics and product improvement purposes (“Usage Data”) as mentioned in Table 1.1 below.
Table 1.1
Information collected or shared via third party sources:
Our third party providers (also known as ‘subprocessors’) only receive personal information about our customers for the limited purposes of providing us with their services.
When we engage a third party who will need access to process personal information as part of their services provided to TMT, we ascertain that the third party is capable and obligated to provide at least the same level of data privacy and security protections we hold ourselves to.
Examples of those third parties include, but are not limited to:
Email delivery;
Customer collaboration and communications solutions;
Software development and analytics solutions;
Application log aggregation systems; and
Cloud infrastructure services.
Our third parties are contractually required to notify us if they can no longer meet the expected level of protections required to safeguard personal info.

Legal grounds for processing personal information
When the law allows us to, TMT will only use personal information that is tied specifically to our customer (i.e., the entity with whom we have a business/contractual relationship with, and with whom an employee at that entity has an employment contract).
This means that in most cases we are collecting and processing personal information on behalf of your organization.
==========
TMT’s legal grounds for collecting and using personal information will depend on the individual from whom the personal information is collected, the actual personal information concerned, and the specific context in which we collect it.
Note that we may process personal information for more than one legal basis depending on the specific purpose for which we are using data.
Usually, we collect personal information in the following circumstances:
Where the collection of personal information is needed for the performance of a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
Where the processing of the personal information is in our legitimate interests and the interests and fundamental rights of the individual do not override those interests.
==========
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Where the collection of personal information is required for the vital interests of the individual or another person.
==========
In limited cases where we may rely on consent (i.e., receiving consent from you or any customer representative who registers for a TMT Services account), you have the right not to provide consent or to withdraw consent at any time.
Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
5.
==========
We go to great lengths to keep personal information safe
We use industry best practices that are the most appropriate administrative, organizational, technical and physical measures designed to protect the personal information that our customers provide to us.
For example, TMT employs at various points in our infrastructure logical and physical access controls, encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection and network monitoring, and secure development practices.
Only authorized personnel have access to the personal information you provide, and each TMT employee with access to personal information is obligated to maintain its integrity and confidentiality.
If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you should immediately contact us.
6.

Derived Media Filter data (blocks or notifications) – 24 months from the time of collection, or 30 days after termination of Agreement, whichever comes first
Insights/statistical data – TMT can retain this data indefinitely
TMT adopts a data minimization approach when it comes to personal information that we retain beyond one (1) year.
==========
When personal information is deemed expired, no longer needed, and does not have to be retained, we follow industry best practices with the secure deletion, destruction, and anonymization of personal data, depending on what method is systematically and procedurally possible, most secure, and what our related retention commitments are.
As retention periods lapse, we use automated processes through periodic audits to identify and securely delete personal info.
If automated deletion is not possible, secure manual deletion may be performed.
8.
==========
International data transfers
Personal information may be transferred, stored, and processed by us or our third party vendors in countries whose data protection laws and regulations may be different to those of your country.
TMT only permits cross border (‘international’) transfers of personal information made between countries or regions when supported by an appropriate legal agreement or an alternative provision that ensures sufficient safeguards and obligations to personal information rights are commensurate.
The sufficiency of these agreements and provisions depend on the countries or regions the personal information is transferred from and to.
Examples of agreements and provisions that may be suitable for transfers (depending on the nature of the international exchange) include, but are not limited to, the following:
The nation or region where personal information is transferred from recognizes the nation or region where personal information is transferred to as having adequate protections in place.
Standard data protection clauses are established.
