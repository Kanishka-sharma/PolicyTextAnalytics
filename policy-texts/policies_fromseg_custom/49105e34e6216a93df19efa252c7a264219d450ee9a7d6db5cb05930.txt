DigiCert Privacy Statement
DigiCert is committed to protecting your privacy in every aspect possible.
When you view our Website, or Purchase an SSL Certificate, You or your
		company's information will not be resold to third parties.
==========
Cookies
Like many websites, digicert.com uses "cookies" to
		allow users to log into the site, and to store users' session IDs.
All personal and identifying information is stored on DigiCert's servers,
		not in your browser's cookies.
This is both more private and more secure.
Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically
		and store it in log files on our servers.
This information includes
		internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
		provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
		stamp, and clickstream data.
==========
Such information is used to better
		understand how visitors navigate through our Sites, to enhance
		your experience while using our Sites, and to make the materials
		as valuable to visitors as possible.
We do not link this information
		to personally identifiable information.
Note: In addition we may
		from time-to-time utilize a third-party tracking service to
		assist in the collection and analysis of such
		data/information.
==========
Cookies are used to track non-personally identifiable
		information about our visitors, similar to the information collected
		and stored in our server log files.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
		which help us better manage content on our site by tracking site usage.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function
		to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In
		contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear
		gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the
		period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered
		by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails
		have been opened by recipients.
This would allow us to gauge the
		effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our
		marketing campaigns.
==========
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please
		see "Newsletter (Unsubscribe/Opt-Out)" below.
Unsolicited Bulk Email, or "Spam"
digicert.com retains an opt-in subscription list for its newsletter.
Only addresses that have been voluntarily and individually subscribed
		are on this list, and they may be unsubscribed at any time.
==========
DigiCert
		does not send unsolicited bulk-email/spam.
Spam Abuse (Notice to DigiCert Partners)
DigiCert does not allow spamming in association with our site, brand,
		or products.
If you have received spam from a reseller advertising
		DigiCert products or services, please report it immediately to legal@digicert.com.
Forward the entire message with all headers
		intact; resellers that send unsolicited bulk email are in direct
		violation of the reseller agreement, and will be prosecuted.
==========

DigiCert provides a simple tool from within your customer account to
		subscribe or unsubscribe to our monthly newsletter.
To unsubscribe
		from the DigiCert Newsletter you will follow the instructions provided
		within the newsletter or send an email to support@digicert.com requesting
		to be removed from our opt-in mail list.

		instructions below (including screen capture images of the opt-out

Live Chat Sales/Support
DigiCert utilizes an internal live chat tool for assisting our customers with sales
		questions and technical support needs; in addition to the customer's
		name and email address (for purposes of communication), this tool collects information
		in accordance with "Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites" above.
==========
Agents
We use an outside payment gateway and credit card processing company
		to bill you for goods and services.
These companies do not retain,
		share, store or use personally identifiable information for any
		other purposes.
Financial Information
digicert.com does not permanently store credit card information on
		its servers.
All credit card numbers and identifying financial data
		are passed directly to the site where credit card orders are processed
		for all digicert.com customers.
Organizational/Personal Information
digicert.com requires organizational and contact information as part
		of the SSL Application process.
Information collected (i.e. organization
		name, physical address, email address, contact name, job title) will
		be used for the following purposes; to provide requested ssl certificate
		services, send a newsletter, to communicate with you regarding your
		account, provide support, and to verify your organizations and/or
		individual identity.
==========
This information is held confidential, and not
		resold or distributed to third parties.
Editing Organizational/Personal Information (Third Party Verification)
DigiCert provides direct access to your personally identifiable
		information, through your DigiCert customer web-pki account.
Certain
		information
		(i.e. organization name, organization address, contact name) cannot
		be directly edited, due to the nature of ssl certification.
If ssl
		order and/or account details have changed, DigiCert will require
		that you submit a change request.
We provide a change request tool
		inside your DigiCert account.
After a change request is submitted
		and received by DigiCert we verify this information through third
		party sources (i.e. State business registration sites, D&B,
		whois domain registrars) and if successfully verified (meaning the
		third party information matches the change request) the request is
		approved and our database is updated.
In the unlikely event that you
		could not log into your account (gain access) to submit a change
		request, you would alternatively contact
		us by sending an email to admin@digicert.com or by mailing a written
		request to the following address:
DigiCert, Inc.

Sub-User Creation & Account Access
DigiCert provides a tool for its primary customer account holders,
		so that they can create sub-users to assist in managing pki functions.
The primary account holder can create multiple sub-users, to which
		personal information is entered (i.e. name, email address, job title,
		username, and password).
The information collected is used to assign
		account access, permissions, and for contact purposes (i.e. technical
		issues).
==========
Sub-users may also be enrolled to receive DigiCert informational/promotional
		materials (i.e. DigiCert newsletter).
Note: If a sub-user to an account
		wishes to change his or her details or to be removed from an account,
		this must first be requested of
		the primary account user within their organization, and alternatively
		direct to DigiCert by email request to admin@digicert.com.
Order Validation Process
Validation is an essential step in your purchase from DigiCert.
==========
In
		order to ascertain that all SSL Certificates are sold to legally
		qualified entities, your organization or personal entity must be
		validated by our staff.
DigiCert will verify such information in
		part by using third parties (i.e. State/Local Government registration
		web-sites, Dun & Bradstreet,
		whois/domain Registrars, and phone directories).
Security
The security of your personal information is important to DigiCert.
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number)
		on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using
		secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Click here to learn more about
		SSL, follow this link http://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm.
We follow
		generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
		submitted to DigiCert, both during transmission and once
		we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
		of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while
		we strive to use commercially acceptable standards to protect your
		personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
