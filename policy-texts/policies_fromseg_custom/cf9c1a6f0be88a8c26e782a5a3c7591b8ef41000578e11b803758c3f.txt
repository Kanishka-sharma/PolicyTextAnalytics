Sift Science Service Privacy NoticeLast Updated: November 29, 2016Part I. General InformationOur commitment to privacySift Science, Inc. (“Sift Science”, “we” or “us”) helps online businesses (our “Customers”) detect and address fraud and other malicious behavior on their digital properties.
In doing so, we collect information about how Internet users (“Users”) interact with our Customers’ digital properties such as their websites and mobile applications (their “Customer Sites”).
We keep privacy firmly in mind when developing, designing and operating our cloud-based, machine-learning platform that is used to predict user intent and prevent fraudulent activity in real time ("the Sift Service").
We have set out in this Service Privacy Policy an explanation of our information privacy practices in 
connection with the provision of the Sift Service to Customers, as well as the decisions Customers make 
regarding the information they provide to us and the options available to Users concerning their information.Please note that this Service Privacy Policy does not describe our collection and use of information when 
visitors access our website.
For an explanation of how we collect and use information via our website, siftscience.com and its sub-domains, please see our Site Privacy Policy.
==========
Introduction to Sift ScienceThe Sift Service begins when Customers provide us with data and information about Users and their interactions with the applicable Customer Site (“Service Data”).
Customers provide that Service Data via our REST Application Programming Interfaces and management console.
Sift Science takes the Service Data and uses our 
proprietary analytics algorithms to convert it into a holistic and relative score (the “Risk Assessment”)  concerning the specified activity on the Customer Site (e.g. purchase transactions, public profile creation or postings, etc.).
==========
This assists in identifying and preventing fraudulent 
activity on the Customer Sites.Our Customers then decide what action to take, or not to take, based on the Risk Assessment.
For example, they 
may choose to block a transaction if there is a high risk of it being a fraudulent transaction.
Customers also 
provide us with ongoing feedback on the accuracy of the Risk Assessment by reviewing transactions and activity 
for fraud.Part II.
==========
Raw Data and How We Use ItService Data that our Customers provide to usOur Customers decide  the types / format of Service Data they wish to send to Sift Science for analysis using 
the Sift Service.
We encourage Customers to work closely with the Sift Science solutions and support teams to 
assess the utility of the specific Service Data they send to us.
Our goal is to help Customers assess whether 
certain activity is problematic, for example, helping to assess the likelihood of payment information being 
stolen or a User’s identity being false.Specifically, Customers may send Sift Science personal information provided by the User, such as email 
addresses, billing addresses, shipping addresses, user login name, and telephone numbers.
Customers may send us 
information about User behavior on their Customer Sites, including the IP address of the device used, the pages 
navigated by the User, time of login/logout, items viewed, added to cart or purchased.
Customers may send data 
points about the form of payment, such as order amount, payment method, partial credit card numbers, and order 
status.In addition, Customers may provide us with information about correspondence or commentary that Users leave on 
their Customer Sites (e.g. private messages, forum posts, product reviews).
==========
This information helps Sift catch 
unsolicited content so that our Customers can operate cleaner services.Customers may also place JavaScript code issued by Sift Science (“Sift JS Snippet”) onto their Customer Sites in order to enable us to collect unique device identifiers, including device metadata, from Users 
automatically.
The Sift JS Snippet collects information to uniquely identify the device the User is using.
From 
time to time, we may alter our device fingerprinting technology to improve its effectiveness at identifying a 
device.Similarly, in connection with their mobile applications, Customers may integrate with Sift-provided SDKs to 
help prevent fraud that may occur through their applications.
The SDKs may enable Sift to collect more precise 
information about the user's location, such as GPS (if the location settings allow it) and IP address.
Additionally, the SDK may collect phone-related metadata (e.g. battery level, device properties, carrier name, 
motion and proximity information) and unique device identifiers.
==========
The security of all of the Service Data we receive is protected by Sift as further described below.Part III.
