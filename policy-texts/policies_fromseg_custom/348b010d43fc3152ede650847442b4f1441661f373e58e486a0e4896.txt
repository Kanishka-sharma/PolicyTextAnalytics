  Effective as from 8 May 2009.
Spotify Ltd (“Spotify”, “we” or “us”) wish to bring you the best music service available.
To be able to do this, and to offer you products and services available on the Spotify web page, Spotify will request some information from you and automatically collect information about your use of the Spotify Software Application, the Spotify Service (both as defined in the Spotify Beta Terms and Conditions of Use) and the Spotify website http://www.spotify.com/ (the “Spotify Website”).
This policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes what personal information we may collect from you and what we will and will not do with that information.

How we collect and use personal information


  When you sign up for a Spotify account or purchase Spotify’s products and services available on the Spotify web page, we may ask you for certain personal information such as email address, postal address, age, gender and residence.
In addition, when you use the Spotify Software Application, Spotify Service and Spotify Website, we will automatically receive information about your use of the application, service and website including personal information such as media that you access, queries you make, date and time of your request, your Internet protocol address, performance of your network and computer, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version.
We will use your personal information (i) to provide the products and services that you have purchased or requested (including the display of customized content and advertising), (ii) to communicate with you concerning your account and customer service issues.
(iii) to personalize and improve the Spotify Software Application, the Spotify Service and the Spotify Website, (iv) to ensure the technical functioning of our products and services, (v) to develop new products and services, and (vi) to protect the copyright-protected content of the Spotify Service (e.g. by limiting access to the Spotify Service content to users with a Spotify account).
