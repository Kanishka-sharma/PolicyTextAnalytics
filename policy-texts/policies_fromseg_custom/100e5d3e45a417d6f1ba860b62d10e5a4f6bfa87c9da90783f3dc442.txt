Shared responsibility
Our customers around the world are subject to many different laws and regulations.
Legal requirements in one country or industry may be inconsistent with legal requirements applicable elsewhere.
==========
As a provider of global cloud services, we must run our services with common operational practices and features across multiple geographies and jurisdictions.
To help our customers comply with their own requirements, we build our services with common privacy and security requirements in mind.
It is ultimately up to our customers, however, to evaluate our offerings against their own requirements, so they can determine if our services satisfy their regulatory needs.
==========
We are committed to providing our customers with detailed information about our cloud services to help them make their own regulatory assessments.
It is also important to note that a cloud platform like Azure requires shared responsibility between the customer and Microsoft.
Microsoft is responsible for the platform, and seeks to provide a cloud service that can meet the security, privacy, and compliance needs of our customers.
Customers are responsible for their environment once the service has been provisioned, including their applications, data content, virtual machines, access credentials, and compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to their particular industry and locale.
