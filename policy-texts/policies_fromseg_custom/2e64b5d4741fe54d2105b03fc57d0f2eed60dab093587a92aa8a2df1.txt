Voluntarily submitted profile details means we may also collect from you information such as:

your likes and dislikes; and
information regarding your experiences with our services.
If you choose to submit information about your religious or philosophical beliefs, your health, sexual life, racial or ethnic background, criminal history or trade union membership Zedge would necessarily have to process those details in operating your account and profile and your submission of such information would be your explicit consent for us to do so.
==========

By default, profile information is set to visible.
You can change your profile to invisible (and vice-versa) at any time by going to "My Account" selecting the link for "Edit Profile" and then making the selection under "Public Profile Status".
If you make any postings to public areas, such as forums, guestbook, or by providing content, then this information will be stored on our databases for public viewing, and in such case any personally identifiable information you submit will be publicly available and can be read, collected and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

Information on visitors 
During the course of any visit to Zedge, the pages you see, along with something called a "cookie", is downloaded to your computer.
Most websites do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to ascertain whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before.
Any information that is supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better service and assists us to analyze the profile of our visitors.
Cookies make it easier for you to maintain your preferences on Zedge, and by seeing how you use Zedge; we can tailor our website around your preferences.
For example: if on a previous visit you went to the mobile wallpaper section, then we might find this out from your cookie and highlight wallpapers that might interest you on your next visit.

More information about cookies 
The purpose of cookies used by Zedge has been previously explained above in this Privacy Policy.
When you enter a site that utilizes "cookies" your computer will automatically be issued with a cookie, provided your internet browser is set to accept them (most are by default).
==========
Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server.
Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used.
Cookies themselves only record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long.
Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time.
The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized services cannot then be provided to that user.
==========
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
You can, should you chose, disable the cookies from your browser and delete all cookies currently stored on your computer.
For example, if you are using Internet Explorer, this can be done by selecting "Tools / Internet Options" and then reviewing your privacy settings or selecting "delete cookies".
==========
This may, however, prevent you from taking full advantage of the services that this website has to offer.

When you supply any personal information to Zedge (e.g., for competitions, Zedge Community services or Zedge membership) we may have legal obligations towards you based upon privacy laws and regulations in the way we deal with that data.
We will collect the information fairly, that is, we will explain how we will use it and tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone else.
The information you provide to Zedge will be used for the following reasons:
to ensure that content from our site is presented to you in the most effective manner and to personalize your visit to our site;
to enable us to continuously enhance the Zedge service, to serve advertising, and to provide to you information, products or services which we feel may be of interest to you (which also helps keep our service free);
to occasionally carry out market research including internal analytical research which will enable us to constantly improve your experience on Zedge;
to carry out our obligations arising from any agreements that may have been entered into between you and us;
to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; and
to notify you about changes to or other information about our service.
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service(s) you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or, in the case of you no longer wish to continue your status as a Zedge member.
In some circumstances it may be necessary to retain your personal information to deal with any disputes.
==========
Accordingly, Zedge may store messaging transcript data (including message content, member names, times and dates) arising from the use of Zedge Community services for a period necessary to fulfill such purpose.
Where personal information is held for people who are not yet registered but have taken part in other Zedge services (e.g. competitions), that information will be held only as long as necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly.
==========
We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
Your personal data will be stored on our backup system, which is kept in case of loss of data.
It may be that where data is lost, the personal data held on you as part of our backup system is used to restore your account to its status before the loss of data.
All personal data (including communication data) stored on the backup system shall be held in accordance with the Data Retention Directive.
==========
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
==========
Zedge may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you have signed up for.
For example, we may wish to provide you with password reminders or notify you that a particular service has been improved or suspended.
The only way you can opt out of receiving these types of administration communications would be to close your registration, which can be accomplished by following the link indicated "To close your Zedge account" in the "My Account" area.
