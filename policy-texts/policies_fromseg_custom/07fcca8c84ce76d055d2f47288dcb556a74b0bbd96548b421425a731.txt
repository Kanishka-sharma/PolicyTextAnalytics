Registration
In order for you to receive certain benefits of our website you may first be asked to supply certain information such as your zip code.

This information is used to deliver you a personalized electronic newsletter that we believe will be of interest to you.
The more of this information you choose to share with us, the better we can craft a newsletter specifically for you.
If you choose not to share information with us the newsletter will simply be more generic.
For example, if you are primarily interested in articles about the environment, we can't deliver those to you unless you share your interest with us.
Similarly, if you are a vegetarian and request recipes without disclosing this fact, we can't guarantee that all recipes we send you will be meat-free.
