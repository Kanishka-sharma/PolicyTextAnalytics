Introduction
At Evolution Finance, Inc. ("Evolution Finance," "we," "us," or "our"), our relationship with you is our most valuable asset.
We understand and appreciate that you are entrusting us with your personal information, and as such, we are committed to being transparent about how we collect, use and disclose it.
==========
This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services, mobile applications and websites (e.g. CardHub.com and WalletHub.com) offered by Evolution Finance or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, the "Site").
This policy describes the personal information Evolution Finance collects when you register for, use, access or otherwise interact with any of our websites, applications, products or services (collectively, the "Services").
By using any of the Services provided by Evolution Finance, you consent to this Privacy Policy, including your consent to our use and disclosure of personal information about you in the manner described below in this Privacy Policy.
In addition, please review our Terms of Service, which governs your use of our Services and includes provisions on arbitration, limitation of damages and choice of law.
==========
Statement of Coverage
This Privacy Policy covers how Evolution Finance uses the personal information we collect in connection with the Services.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies not owned or controlled by Evolution Finance.
==========
Our Services are intended only for U.S. citizens and residents.
If you are visiting our websites from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
==========
By using our Services or websites, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information Collection & Use
General: Evolution Finance may collect and store information about you and others when you register with Evolution Finance, when you use Services, when you visit Evolution Finance pages or the pages of Evolution Finance properties (e.g. CardHub.com and WalletHub.com) or the pages of certain Evolution Finance partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes conducted, endorsed, or advertised by Evolution Finance.
==========
Evolution Finance uses information for the following general purposes: providing, maintaining, optimizing, and improving our services, developing new services, enhancing the user experience, customizing the advertising, offers and content you see, fulfilling your product and service requests, research and development, managing your customer relationship with us, providing you customer support, contacting you, and providing reports for our internal and external clients and partners.
Registration: Upon registering with Evolution Finance, personal information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, or ZIP code may be requested.
==========
Certain products and services may ask you for additional information, such as your address, phone number, income, Social Security number, details about the financial products you use, driver's license number or information about your assets.
Some of the personal information we collect when you register, like your Social Security number, is required by the credit bureau to verify your identity so we can fulfill your request for a free credit score and credit report.
When requesting your credit report and score on your behalf, we do not do a hard inquiry; rather, we do a soft inquiry of your credit report.
==========
We may also collect personal information or other information directly from you through various other forms and places throughout the Services, including "Contact Us" forms, or when you otherwise interact with us to provide or enhance our Services.
You are not anonymous to us when you register with Evolution Finance and sign in to our Services.
Transactions: Evolution Finance collects information about your transactions with us and some of our partners.
This includes billing and payment information and information about your use of our products and service offerings.
We share this information with third parties who perform tasks required to complete purchase transactions (such as fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments).
==========
Special Offers and Updates:Â We use information we collect in providing the Services, including personal information, to match you with offers for financial products and services.
Generally, we will display these offers when you access our Services, but we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions, by email or other electronic messaging.
You can opt out of these types of email or electronic messaging communications within your account or by following the unsubscribe link included in each email.
Automatically Collected Information: Evolution Finance uses cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to automatically collect and record certain information from the computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services, including device identifier, technical information about your device, IP address, browser type, browser language, the webpages you request, location information, and the date and time of your request.
==========
When we use third-party tools, those third parties may also collect such information.
We and our third-party partners may receive usage data about you whenever you interact with the Services, such as when you look at another person's profile, send someone a message, search for a topic, person, product, or page, or click on an ad.
==========
When you post things like photos or videos on the Services, we may also receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.
We use automatically collected information to provide the Services, create analytics to improve the Services, serve advertisements to you, and enable features, like signing in via a social media account.
==========
At this time, Evolution Finance does not respond to automated signals regarding tracking mechanisms, including "do not track" instructions from your browser.
However, you may change the privacy preferences in your browser to prevent or limit the use of cookies or similar technologies.

==========
Location: We may collect and store information about your device's precise location if you enable your computer or mobile device to share it with us.
Evolution Finance will not collect your precise location information without your consent.
However, we may ask your consent to using location-enabled services on your device so that we can collect, share and process information about your device's location to enhance our Services and provide better offers to you, using information like GPS or Wi-Fi access point information.
You may change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information.
We may also use information like your IP address or other device identifiers for approximate location information, like your city or state.
==========
Public Content: Your reviews, comments, questions and answers, posts, followers, groups, financial products in your Wallet, businesses and professionals that you have done business with, topics and users you follow, profile information (including your name), and any other information that you post to the Service are meant for public consumption.
We may display this content on the Service, collect and store it, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.
Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make other personal information (e.g. your home address) available online for viewing by third parties by posting it on the Service, that information is public and can be seen, collected and used by others besides us.
We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of such information.
Other Users: We receive information about you from other users through their use of the Service, such as when they follow you, comment on your posts, ask you questions, mention you, or send you messages.
==========
Contacts: When you invite your friends to join the Service by providing their contact information or allowing us to use your address book from your computer, mobile device, or other sites, we may use and store your friends' contact information long enough to process your requests.
Messages: If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them.
If you send information from the Service to your phone via SMS text message, we may log your phone number, phone carrier, and the date and time that the message was processed.
Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive.
When you send email or other communications to Evolution Finance, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
==========
As part of our credit monitoring service, you may also receive SMS text messages, push alerts on your phone, and emails when there is a credit or savings alert.
These alert messages will also be logged.
==========
Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Service are only private to the extent that you and the sender/recipient keep them private.
For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your personal messages publicly posts it or its contents.
==========
Other Sites: We offer some of our services on or through other web sites.
Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Evolution Finance in order to deliver the service.
==========
We process such information according to this Privacy Policy.
The Service includes links to other web sites and provides access to products and services (for example, widgets and applications) offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control.
When you access another web site, access the Service with a third-party account (like Facebook or Twitter), or purchase third-party products or services through the Service, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.
We do not exercise control over these third party sites and they may place their own cookies or other files on your device, collect data, web site usage information and your device identifier, or solicit personal information from you.
==========
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party.
We encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to read the privacy policies and terms of service of all third party web sites or applications before submitting any personal information to third parties.
You can also connect your Evolution Finance account to your accounts on third party services like Facebook or Twitter, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the third party service as well as other information from these third party services that you have given us permission to access (e.g. name, date of birth, profile picture and friends birthdays).
==========
These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.
We use the information to help you connect and share public content with your friends and followers.
==========
You can always disconnect your accounts on these third party services from your Evolution Finance account by visiting those services directly.
Information Provided by Third Parties about You: Evolution Finance may supplement the information we collect about you with information from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to consider financial products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
==========
This includes, for example, the free credit report and free credit score we may obtain on your behalf when you register for the Service from a credit bureau (e.g., TransUnion).
Examples of other sources from which we may collect personal information include our business partners, publicly-available sources, data providers, other users and social media platforms that you use to log into the Services.
We treat all information about you, whether received from you or from a third party, as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.
==========
Referrals: If you choose to use our referral program to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.
We will email your friend an invitation to visit the site.
==========
Evolution Finance stores the information you provide for the sole purpose of sending this email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Please be aware that when you use any referral functionality through our Services, your name and email address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
==========
Service-Related Announcements:Â We may send you service-related announcements.
For instance, if we update our privacy practices or if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
Generally, you may not opt out of these non-promotional communications.
If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to terminate your account.
==========
Push Notifications:Â If you use our Mobile Applications, we may send you push notifications from time-to-time via our Mobile Application in order to provide or alert you to service-related announcements or information on products, services, special deals, or promotions.

We will not knowingly or intentionally collect any personal information online from children under the age of 16.
If a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, please let us know by filling out our contact form.
==========
Once received, we will remove that information from our Services.
Disclosure & Sharing of Information
Evolution Finance may share information you have provided during use of our Services under the following circumstances:

When you use our Services to obtain offers for financial products and services, you direct us to provide our partners with your credit data and other relevant information you provide as a way to match you with offers for financial products and services from those partners.
Generally, we will display these offers when you access our web or mobile Services, but we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions, by email or other electronic messaging.
It is always your choice whether or not to apply for an offered product or service and we will never submit an application for a financial product or service on your behalf without your express consent.
If you are interested in pursuing an offer for a financial product or service or a co-branded service, you will need to submit information directly to the partner that provides such product or service.
==========
For example, if you are interested in a credit card offer, you will be taken to a third-party site to apply for that credit card.
When you are asked to provide information to a third party in connection with such offers or co-branded services, you may be providing your information to both us and our partner.
We will treat information we collect in connection with a particular offer or co-branded service in accordance with this Privacy Policy but we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.
For more information, see Other Sites.
==========
When Evolution Finance shares information about you with third-party partners, some of those partners may also perform a soft inquiry or promotional inquiry on your credit file based on the information Evolution Finance shares with them.
These inquiries will not affect your credit.
However, if you apply for a line of credit or a loan directly with one or more of our lending partners, those lenders may make a hard credit inquiry of your credit file before approving your application.
==========
The Services may permit you to submit ideas, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including personal information (collectively, "User Content"), that is publicly viewable (such as the public portions of your user profile or comments you post on our publicly accessible blog).
We or others may reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed).
==========
Third parties may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it further with third parties across the Internet.
Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content.
Evolution Finance does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you disclose publicly or share with others, whether through the Service or otherwise.
==========
We may use third-party service providers or vendors to support or perform certain aspects of the Service or our business on our or your behalf, such as hosting the Service, designing or operating the Service's features, tracking the Service's analytics, providing data used, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Service, marketing or advertising the Service, enabling Evolution Finance to contact you with offers or performing other administrative services.
We may provide these third-party service providers or vendors with access to user information, including personal information, in connection with the services they are performing for you or for us.
In connection with our Services, these third-party service providers or vendors may also set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your device, and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you.
==========
When we may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each a "Promotion") through the Services or through social media or other channels.
By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion.
==========
While responding to subpoenas, court orders, legal processes, establishing or exercising our legal rights, or defending against legal claims if in our good faith opinion such action is required or permitted by law.
When we believe it is necessary to share information with law enforcement, government authorities or private parties to (a) protect our, your, or others' rights, privacy, safety, or property (including by making and defending legal claims); (b) enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Service; or (c) protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical, or illegal activity, including cyberattacks and identity theft.
==========
After we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.
We may share and transfer personal information with acquirers and other relevant participants in business transactions (or potential transactions) involving a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, sale or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, Evolution Finance or our affiliates (including, in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
Advertisements
Evolution Finance and its service providers and advertising partners display targeted advertisements, which are based upon personal information.
==========
We may allow others to "sponsor" some of your account activities, such as reviews, recommendations, status updates, and posts regarding "deals," in order to increase the likelihood that others see them.
For example, if you apply for a new credit card, the respective credit card company may want to make sure that people who follow you see it so they can apply for it too.
==========
If content is sponsored, it will appear accompanied by the word "Sponsored" or something similar.
Only people that could originally see the information can see the sponsored post, and no personal information about you (or your friends) is shared with the sponsor.
==========
We may work with third-party advertising networks, marketing partners, publishers and other entities ("Advertising Partners") to perform analytics and advertise our products and services on other online services not affiliated with us.
In connection with these advertising services, we or our Advertising Partners, like Google, may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect behavioral information about how you use our site or other online services over time in order to perform tracking and marketing analytics or serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you ("Interest-Based Advertisements").
Online Tracking Choices
There are a number of ways to opt out of having your online activity and device data collected for Interest-Based Advertisements, which we have summarized below.
==========
Note that because these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.
Our Advertising Partners may permit you to opt out of all or some Interest-Based Advertisements on designated websites.
==========
For example, many of our Advertising Service Providers participate in the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out program or Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out program.
We utilize the following Google Analytics Advertising Features as part of our marketing analytics and advertising: Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Platform integrations and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and may from time to time use other services provided by Google Analytics.
Google provides users an opportunity to opt-out of the Google Analytics Features through Google's Ads Settings and their web browser opt-out plugin.
==========
For additional information on opting out of interest-based ads by Google, visit Google's site.
Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising.
==========
To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings.
Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.
For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

==========
When you use Evolution Finance services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and where permitted by law we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.
After you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
==========
Evolution Finance is not responsible for and cannot amend the information in your credit report, which is produced by one or more credit reporting agencies.
If you believe that some of the information in your credit report is inaccurate, you must contact the applicable credit reporting agency directly.
Information on how to contact the credit reporting agency is contained on the "Credit Report" page for each account.
Security
Evolution Finance takes a number of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information about you.
==========
However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile device or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
==========
If you believe your Evolution Finance account has been compromised, please report the incident using our contact form.
If you have been contacted by someone about your Evolution Finance account asking for a password, birth date or other personal information, please do NOT respond and forward the email to fraud@EvolutionFinance.com.

Evolution Finance is not responsible for safeguarding the communications once sent to you.
