Introduction
Zemanta is a global provider of advertising technology to advertisers and agencies.
This privacy policy governs Zemanta’s collection and use of data on websites where Zemanta’s proprietary Zemanta DSP technology is used to purchase ads (also known as “Zemanta One”).
This privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of data on Zemanta’s corporate web site (http://www.zemanta.com).
Zemanta is a member of IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) and adheres to its policies around online consumer privacy.
While not a member, Zemanta adheres to Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct self-regulatory principles.
==========
Platform Data Collection
When you visit a website or application that queries  Zemanta One platform for targeted ads, we collect certain information about you and your device (“User Information”).
Some of this User Information, including for example your IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device, and may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere.
User Information that we may collect includes: IP address, domain, browser type and language, referring website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search keywords, your activities and actions on publisher’s sites, browser history, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation (including city, country, zip code, and geographic coordinates, if you have enabled location services on your device), click data, types of advertisements viewed, and information about your device including device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type.
We do not collect any “sensitive personal data” as defined under European data protection laws.
We may also collect information about our partners’ interactions with you—for example, by placing pixels on an advertiser’s webpage so we can know if you ultimately purchased an item after viewing an advertisement bought through our platform or by integrating with the partners’s web analytics software, so we can know how long and where you engaged on their site.
==========
We may partner with other companies that are permitted to share anonymous information with us in order to enhance audience profiles.
For example, we may partner with companies to learn the kinds of products you buy or express interest in.
How we collect information
We collect information in industry standard ways, including:

Cookies – Cookies are short strings of characters.
Zemanta uses cookies to uniquely identify an internet browser and in turn a device.
We sync those cookies with our partners, so we can identify users across environments and know which segements our partners identify them with.
For more information about cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
==========
Pixel Tags – Pixel tags are transparent images or short snippets of Javascript that our partners and clients use to understand how their users interact with their properties online, including websites and mobile apps.
Mobile Advertising Identifiers – Mobile advertising IDs (like IDFA) are unique, non PII IDs associated with individual mobile devices.
Users can reset them by instructing their device to do so.
==========
General Web Analytics – We integrate with Web Analytics software of our clients and partners in order to observe how users behave after clicking on ads.
We do not control how third party Web Analytics software collects the data as this is defined by its own privacy policy.
How we use the information we collect
We primarily use User Information to enable our partners and clients to buy appropriate advertising space across the Zemanta One platform, which allows buying advertisement on the web and in desktop and mobile apps.
==========
User Information is used to target ads to consumers on behalf of our advertisers.
This means displaying ads that might be of interest to consumers sharing certain traits.
In some cases our data is used in conjunction with the information advertisers have collected themselves (for example by bringing their CRM data into Zemanta One platform).
User Information is also used to appropriately price the ads on behalf of our advertisers.
You agree that Zemanta and its third party partners may disclose links to or the entirety of articles you read, and in connection therewith, waive any rights you may have under the California Reader Privacy Protection Act, the United States Video Privacy Protection Act, and any similar federal, state, local, or foreign law.
You further acknowledge that information we disclose to third parties in anonymized form may be de-anonymized, and third parties may be able to ascertain your identity using this information in conjunction with other information they may have.
==========
Data retention
Cookies that are used to identify browsers expire after one year or less on a user’s machine.
Likewise data Zemanta One platform retains about those identifiers is retained for 90 days.
Log level data of served ad such as IP address and date an ad is served may be retained indefinitely.
==========
Opt-Out
Opt out means you inform Zemanta One platform that you wish Zemanta to delete the data it holds about your browser and ceases collecting data while you remain opted-out (which means non-unique opt-out cookie is set in your browser).
In practice this means Zemanta One platform will not have and therefore will not be able to use any information specific to your browser to deliver targeted ads to you.
Please note that you will still see ads if you opt out, they just won’t be interest-based or otherwise targeted based on your browser’s cookie.
You can opt out on this page: http://www.zemanta.com/opt-out
Additionally you can reset your Mobile Advertising Identifiers on your mobile device by following instructions for iOS devices and for Android Devices.
Information Our Customers Collect
Our customers and other third parties who use our technology may use their own tags, pixels, cookies, or other similar technology (or those of their other affiliates) within their advertisements and on certain websites.
==========
These customers maintain their own privacy policies and processes.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of customers that use our technology.
