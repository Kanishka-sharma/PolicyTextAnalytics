An opt-out election must be made for each separate account you hold at TD AMERITRADE.
Does TD AMERITRADE share the information collected with any other third parties?
==========
The cornerstone of our Privacy Statement is the commitment to keep our clients' personal information confidential.
TD AMERITRADE does not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third party for purposes of marketing by the third party, or for any reason, except as described below:
In order to administer or process a transaction, product or service you have authorized or requested or in connection with settling a transaction.
==========
For example, we may be required to deliver personal information about you to third parties for certain investments, and to perform electronic funds transfers and wires.
We may disclose personal information about you to third parties or to government entities as required by law or regulation or in response to subpoenas, to credit bureaus and collection agencies, or when necessary to protect your rights or property or that of TD AMERITRADE.
==========
To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, fulfillment, client service, client satisfaction surveys or other data collection activities relevant to our business.
We may also provide a party with client information from our database to help us to analyze and identify client needs and notify clients of product and service offerings.
==========
Use of the information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose.
If you decide to participate in certain promotions and special offers, the promotion may require us to gather and share your personal information or may require you to supply personal information to the promotion sponsor, which may be a third party.
For example, a referral program may require that we provide your name as a reference to a prospective client.
It is always your choice whether or not to participate.
==========
If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement.
All third parties with which we share personal information are required to protect personal information in a manner similar to the way we protect personal information.
==========
If we propose to share information in a manner not covered in this Privacy Statement, we will notify you of this change by posting an addendum on the Web site, a notice in the "Announcements" or "What's New" section of the Web site, and if appropriate, provide you an opportunity to opt-out of such use.
Can I opt-out of sharing my personal information with non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes?
Because we do not share information with non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes without your prior permission, there is no need to opt-out.
Can I opt-out of receiving certain information?
Yes.
==========
You can control your communications preferences on the Communications Preferences Page for your account.
If you want to opt-out of receiving all direct marketing communication from TD AMERITRADE, you can send an email to unsubscribe@tdameritrade.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line and your TD AMERITRADE account number in the body copy.
In doing so, you will be identified as a client who does not care to be contacted by us through direct communication for additional product and services offerings or inquiries.
==========
An opt-out election made by one account owner of a Joint account is applicable to all account owners of the Joint account.
An opt-out election must be made for each separate account you hold at TD AMERITRADE.
This opt-out will not apply to communications required to service your account.
Does TD AMERITRADE's Privacy Statement apply to the sites to which we link?
