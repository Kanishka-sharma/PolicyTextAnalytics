DO WE USE COOKIES?
Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web site that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive.
BJ's uses cookies to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses BJ's Sites and to remember your membership ID when you log out of BJ's Sites to make it easier for you to use the BJ's Sites.

However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
Therefore, please read the privacy statements of other sites linked to this web site.
==========
HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
BJ's does not share your information with unaffiliated third parties.
BJ's may share your personally identifiable  information with third parties as set forth below.
In such circumstances, we limit the information we provide to the information necessary to perform the function or provide the service for which it is shared.
These third parties are not permitted to use the personal information which is provided by us for any purposes other than as authorized by BJ's, and these third parties are required to keep the information confidential.

==========
To facilitate Member orders with business partners' web sites linking to the BJ's Sites, BJ's may "prepopulate" or permit these sites to recognize and input certain personal information when you place these orders to avoid repeated reentry of required order information.
If you apply for or request certain products or services directly from our specialty business partners, you may receive information directly from them regarding their products or services.

We may share aggregated demographic information and/or customer profile data with our business partners, advertisers and others.
This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.
