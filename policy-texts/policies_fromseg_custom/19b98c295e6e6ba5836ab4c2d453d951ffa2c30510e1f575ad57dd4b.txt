What We Provide

Posterous is the easy way to get content online using e-mail.
You can e-mail content of 
any type (rich text, photos, music, video, Word/Powerpoint/Excel/PDF documents, and zip archives) 
to us.
==========
We will post it online in the most web-friendly format, then reply with a public URL that 
can be forwarded or shared with friends.
Account creation is never required, but if a user does 
create an account, posts from your various e-mail addresses (work, home, and mobile phone) can 
all be integrated into one blog.
