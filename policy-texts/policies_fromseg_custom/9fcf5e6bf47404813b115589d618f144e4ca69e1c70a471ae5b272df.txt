III.
HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFO
Summary: We use and share your info in accordance with the legal bases set out below to help us provide, operate, improve, understand, customize, support and market the Riot Services.
A. Legal Basis
Summary: We use and share your info (i) to provide the services under the Terms of Service, (ii) with your consent, (iii) in our or others’ legitimate interests (such as safety, security, and providing a tailored service), and (iv) for other legal reasons.
Send to top
B. Using Info
Summary: We use the info we collect (both individually and in combination with other info collected under this notice) to help us operate our business, provide and improve our products and services, communicate with you, and advertise effectively.

Send to top
C. Sharing Info
Summary: We don’t share your contact info (such as your email or home address) with independent third parties without your knowledge except as described in this notice (like to enforce the Terms of Service, secure the Riot Services, or if we’re required to do so by law or respond to legal process).
We don’t sell your information to independent third parties.
==========
We do share non-contact info (like your Summoner Name, match history, game stats, and other aggregate or anonymous info), including publicly via the Riot Games API.
If we ever stop providing Riot Services or certain parts of them (like if we’re bought out or invaded by Yordles), we may share your info with the buyer.
Lastly, remember the stuff you share in social features (like voice and text chat) is public—please be careful about how you use them and if you’re sensitive about any info, don’t share it on voice or text chat!
==========

D. Communication & Player Behavior
We’ve empowered our players to help enforce our policies (e.g.the acceptable use and behavioral policies that we publish from time to time on our websites, apps and games) related to certain in-game behavior.
For example, players may report each other and submit information about their in-game activity and actions to help us determine if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that apply to player conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions).
We also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor voice and text chat and similar details about optional interactions for a period we determine is appropriate to help us, among other things, address disruptive behavior, improve our services, enforce our rules and policies and Terms of Service, and foster a more positive gaming community for our players.
We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation (e.g. to keep the Riot Services safe and secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.g. understanding how the Riot Services are used, keeping them secure, and improving them).
==========
We use both manual (like enabling you to report such behavior through Player Support tickets) and automated (such as machine learning, transcription, and analysis) tools and techniques to support these efforts.
To enable us to monitor compliance with our policies, we develop template patterns of inappropriate behavior (e.g. abuse, hate speech, cheating, threats, offensive or inappropriate names), which we consider indicative of prohibited behaviors.
==========
We do this based upon an analysis of actual behaviors on the Riot Services.
We grade these patterns of inappropriate behavior based upon their severity with different consequences (e.g. temporary or permanent account restrictions or communications restrictions) for players based upon how serious their conduct is.
If another player makes a complaint about your behavior, our automated tools use these patterns of inappropriate behavior and grading system to compare your behavior over time with these patterns of inappropriate behavior and, if you have engaged in inappropriate behavior, make a decision as to the consequences for you of your behavior.
This primarily helps us enforce our rules and policies, secure the Riot Services, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and maintain the competitive integrity of our games.
==========
Our complaints procedure may allow you to appeal a decision.
In this case, we may provide you with information that illustrates our rationale and factors that contributed to our decision, along with some tips on how to avoid repeating such behavior in the future.
If you still wish to appeal, you may request one of our agents to review your case who will make a final manual determination as to the correct outcome based on the available evidence.
==========
Please be kind to other players, observe our policies related to player behavior (including our Terms of Service), and always be thoughtful about how you communicate with others!
E. Anti-Cheat & Fraud Prevention
We always seek to offer players a fair, fun, and competitive gaming experience on the Riot Services.
Our Terms of Service strictly prohibit use of unauthorized third-party programs that interact with the Riot Services, including mods, hacks, cheats, scripts, bots, trainers, and automation programs.
When you create or use a Riot Games account, purchase things from us, play our games, or otherwise interact with the Riot Services, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies (such as anti-cheat software that may run in the background of your device), that may make automated decisions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions, communications restrictions, removal of content, or limited access to game content) based on the info we collect from or about you (see Info We Collect).
==========
We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation (e.g. to keep the Riot Services secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.g. understanding how the Riot Services are used, keeping them secure, and improving them).
To enable us to monitor compliance with our anti-cheat and fraud prevention policies, we develop template patterns of inappropriate behavior (e.g. cheating, fraud), which we consider indicative of prohibited behaviors.
==========
We do this based upon an analysis of actual behaviors on the Riot Services.
We grade these patterns of inappropriate behavior based upon their severity with different consequences (e.g. temporary or permanent account restrictions, communications restrictions, removal of content, or limited access to game content) for players based upon how serious their conduct is.
