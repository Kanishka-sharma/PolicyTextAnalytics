==========

==========
Failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this EULA, or any provision of this EULA, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
If any part of this EULA is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
NOTHING IN THIS EULA WILL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.
==========
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
Generally
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and ZAM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and ZAM agree that every dispute arising in connection with this EULA will be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this EULA.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND ZAM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
Exceptions
Despite the provisions of Section 23.1, nothing in this EULA will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
==========
Arbitrator
Any arbitration between you and ZAM will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting ZAM.
Notice; Process
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”).
ZAM’s address for Notice is: ZAM Network, LLC, 12121 Wilshire Blvd.
Suite 301, Los Angeles, CA 90025.
==========
The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or ZAM may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or ZAM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, ZAM will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by ZAM in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
Fees
If you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, ZAM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, you agree to reimburse ZAM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
==========
No Class Actions
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ZAM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and ZAM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
Modifications to this Arbitration Provision
If ZAM makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to ZAM’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to ZAM’s address for Notice, in which case your account with ZAM will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
Enforceability
If Section 23.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 23 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 23 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 23 will govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.
The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
==========
Consent to Electronic Communications
By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
