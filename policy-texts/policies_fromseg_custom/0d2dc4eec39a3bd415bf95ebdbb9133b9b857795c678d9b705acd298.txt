Additional information on how personal data is handled can be found under https://www.meetrics.com/en/compulsory-data-protection-information/
I. Purpose of measurements performed by Meetrics:
Meetrics performs analyses for the purpose of determining the quality of advertising environments, on behalf of advertisers, media agencies, online marketers and website operators.
==========
As a result, customers are provided with information about the following aspects:
the share of advertising materials that became visible as a percentage of all delivered advertising materials
whether advertising was displayed in environments that might be harmful to the brand
whether calls were generated by botnets or other fraudulent delivery situations
Meetrics Viewability measuring does not require any personal attributes.
Meetrics Viewability measuring is based solely on websites’ internal visibility properties.
II.
==========
Technical basics
Meetrics uses a javascript that is integrated into an HTML document in the course of advertising delivery to analyse visits to a page.
As part of the analysis, aggregated evaluations are created based on individual visits, to provide information about the advertising positions used.
The evaluation objects in this context are advertising positions in individual sections of a page (on the most granular assessment level for example, information could be provided that out of 1,000 instances of advertising delivery within a campaign, 800 instances have become effectively visible in a particular advertising position of a domain).
==========
III.
Data collected
In order to be able to provide the full scope of our services, user interaction with the website and the advertising material may be saved.
For this purpose, data about the user’s operating system and browser will be collected.
Interaction with the website is also recorded in order to determine the visibility of advertising media and to distinguish human visitors to a website from automated calls.
In order to account for the environments in which advertising is placed, it is also verified whether specified keywords are present in advance.
We do not create profiles.
==========
Meetrics does not collect, retain or share any personally identifiable information gathered on sites or apps not owned by Meetrics.
This includes both unique user identifiers, as well as IP addresses (except for the limited purpose of ad fraud prevention, upon which it is retained for only 12 hours).
User IP address
Meetrics saves IP addresses for a short time, in order to identify the geographical origin of the traffic.
Furthermore, Meetrics is also tasked by customers to identify fraudulent advertising delivery and to present this as an aggregated result for each analysed advertising position.
==========
Storage time is extended to 12 hours, only for IP addresses that show a suspect frequency of calls.
IP Addresses which do not show any signs of fraud are removed immediately.
==========
The aggregation of calculated performance key figures based on different aggregation criteria takes place based on campaign information and no personal attributes are used at any time.
Meetrics Audience Verification
This service allows advertisers to determine the socio-demographic spread of users of an online access panel found in specific advertising positions.
==========
For preparing this statistical analysis, Meetrics cooperates with online panel providers.
In the course of registering users for this type of panel on the panel operator’s website, users explicitly grant consent for personal data to be captured by the panel provider.
Furthermore, a cookie containing a pseudonymised user ID is placed by Meetrics following opt-in by the panel lists.
The content of the cookie is also transmitted if an accordingly marked user retrieves a file from the Meetrics server as part of a Meetrics Ad Attention Monitor script delivery.
This data is only provided to our customers in aggregated form.
Transmission of results based on individual panel lists is excluded.
==========
V. Disclosure and duration of storage
Under no circumstances will personal data collected on the customers’ websites be sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties.
Aggregated data to assess the quality of advertising positions (e. g. advertising format x on domain y) is provided to Meetrics’ customers (protected by a password).
Meetrics uses a data centre in Germany to perform data processing and storage (https://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Datenschutz-FAQ).
Aggregated data may be saved for up to 2 years.

==========
Lega base
Meetrics Viewabilty and Fraud detection is based on Article 6.
(1) f. GDPR.
GDPR Art. 6 (1)f -,,processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data”
Reason for one’s own legitimate interest
Recital: The processing of personal data within the necessary quantity for the prevention of fraud constitutes a legitimate interest of the responsible person.
The processing of personal data for the purpose of direct advertising can be considered as serving the legitimate interest of a person.
==========
It is within the legitimate internal interest of the website operator to prevent fraudulent web page visits from generating on his website.
In the end this damages the operation of the website.
==========
Meetrics clients have an interest in playing their advertisement out to people.
Only then will the advertisement have the chance to unfold its effect.
The determination of the country of origin is furthermore essentially important for billing of the advertisement call ups, since it is only through this that it can be ensured that the call ups are suitable to the advertisement.
==========
Are there milder options which could achieve this goal
In order to prevent the call ups of automated visitors a fingerprint of the computer initiating the call ups could be formed.
But Meetrics does not do this.
==========
The IP address is only stored for a short period of time.
It is stored for a maximum time of 12 hours within the system.
==========
External Service providers can be used to determine the geographical origin.
They are in the position to make a more precise determination of the country of origin.
==========
Meetrics has decided not to pass on the IP address to the outside world.
The IP address will be synchronized internally only the assignment of a country will take place.
The privacy policy of Meetrics provides transparency concerning the use of Information from the IP address.
==========
When can the processing be reasonably expected by the involved parties
Recital
The existence of a legitimate interest would have to be carefully evaluated.
It is necessary to examine whether the person concerned, at the time of collecting the personal data and considering the circumstances in which the collection occurred could reasonably foresee that the processing would be carried out for that purpose.
==========
In the privacy policy of the website, the user can also see that tracking by Meetrics can take place through an external script.
More detailed information can be found by the user on the Meetrics website.
By calling up the website, it must be clear to the affected person that this will transfer their IP address to the server of the website.
==========
This is processed to prevent mass page views so that fraud and possible impairment of the operation of the website is prevented.
What are the legitimate interests of the person concerned
Website visits which do not form personality profiles which could then be used on other websites for further profiling.
Result 
It is in the interest of the website operator whom finances the operation of the website through advertising, to protect it against fraudulent call ups.
The IP address is furthermore briefly stored for the purpose of documentation and the determination of fraud and will be deleted afterwards.
This is stated in the privacy policy of Meetrics .
==========
Meetrics continually works on saving the smallest possible amount of data.
