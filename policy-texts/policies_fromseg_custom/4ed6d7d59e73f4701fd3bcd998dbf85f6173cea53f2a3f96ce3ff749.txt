We do not collect sensitive information
from you (such as data relating to health or religious beliefs).
Although it
may be possible for us to infer certain information, such as your religious
beliefs, from certain Behavioural Data that we may collect, we do not create or
use segments that rely on the use of sensitive personal information for the
purposes of online behavioural advertising.
How do we use the information we

Optomaton combines some geo-location information
that it collects from you on Publisher Sites and uses that personal information
for the benefit of each Advertiser.
By way of example:
·      
if Optomaton collects personal information when
you visit Publisher Site A, that personal information may be used to display an
ad to you, on a third party website, for products available on Publisher Site
B.
The purposes for which we use your
personal information are described further below:
Ø 
Deliver relevant and interest-based
advertising.
We use
inferences about your personal preferences, interests and behaviour to serve
relevant and personalised advertisements for Advertisers’ products and services
to you when you visit Publisher Sites.
This means that you receive
advertisements for products and services that are more likely to be of
interest.
