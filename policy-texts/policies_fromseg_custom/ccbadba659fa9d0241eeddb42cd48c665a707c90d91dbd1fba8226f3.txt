Bottom line: We know that almost no one reads those 10 page TOS guidelines, so we'll make this short and sweet...

You're free to put up anything with a genuine purpose.
Generally something that your grandmother would accept or like.
==========
Other than that, you are PROHIBITED from putting any content that's related to the following: (If found, our staff & fraud scripts will FIND AND REMOVE THEM INSTANTLY and your I.P. banned from 110mb network.)
Do the following if you're a monkey & want to get banned forever: 



Phishing of any company, especially MySpace, eBay, PayPal and other banks.
(This is when a scammer creates a fake company site that looks real, hence tricking the visitor to enter their username/password.)
==========
Hosting Proxy  Scripts (like PHProxy).
These are scripts that allow a visitor to enter any domain through your site, and the domain won't pickup the visitors true I.P. address.
They are way too CPU resource intensive.
Eitherway the ports they use are disabled.
==========
Hosting Torrent Scripts (like TorrentFlux, SendSpace, RapidLeech).
This is when torrents are downloaded to 110mb servers and you later on download it to your PC.
==========
Hosting Torrent Trackers (like Azureus, BitComet, BitTornado, Shareaza).
Torrent Trackers are one of the most CPU consuming scripts alive!
==========
And 110mb must pay hundreds for monthly  bandwidth to support the selfish clowns using them.
We literally file lawsuits instantly against anyone using these as they do major damage to 110mb service.
==========
Using your account mainly for file storage of images, videos or music.
110mb is a working website hosting service (meaning a site with purposeful content on it).
It's not a place to primarily backup/store your files, whether for good or bad intentions.
==========
For picture/file storage see this directory.
Hosting Radio Blogs.
==========
Not allowed for same reason as above point.
These imply you'll be hosting tons of music files on your account.
==========
Using phpMyAdmin, Joomla, Mambo, VBulletin.
They  are extremely CPU resource intensive scripts.
==========
And to keep servers running fast, we can't allow them at all.
Hosting MySQL scripts that constantly write data to MySQL.
A good example of this is "AdLogger".
This script is constantly filling up the database tables with Adsense views and clicks.
You can imagine this ripping the hard-drives badly!
==========
Another example is Visitor tracker.
This naturally is recording data constantly.
==========
DO NOT HOST THESE kinds of scripts.
Hosting Chat Rooms (or) IRC bots.
Most paid hosting providers don't even allow this due to  scripts nature the kill system resources.
==========
If found, account is deleted.
Hosting  your own PHP file manager.
Using your own file manager (to upload, delete, etc..
.
files) puts a security risk on the network.
==========
Hence not allowed.
Having more then 3 accounts.
If you registered more then 3 accounts, all of them will be found and deleted.
Eg: acc1/acc2/acc3/acc4.110mb.com.
That's a no-no!
==========
Generally no serious member needs more then 1.
Sales or promotion of beer, hard alcohol, tobacco or drugs.
This especially includes pharmaceutical medicines and stimulators like Viagra and Cialis.
==========
Using your domain to spam other sites.
Do you like getting spam?
Nope.
Does the next person you're targeting?
Nope.
Then don't do it!
==========
110MB contacts the spammers ISP  to shut down their internet connection and get the spammers personal information.
Stealing someone's content or storing/using   illegal files.
==========
Includes software/cracks/scripts.
Eg: Invalid licenses of VBulletin or IPB forum.
==========
These infringe the copyright of the authors or companies work, labour & time.
Hence not allowed.
You wouldn't like your stuff being distributed or sold online without your permission!
==========
Child porn.
(This is UNrelated to adult porn material, which is ALLOWED.)
This is porn under 18.
It's a no-no bigtime!
==========
Having incorrect/garbage name or address filed on your account.
Eg: A name like "Aaadfdf Ffdfsf" or address like "44444444 Ptrc Rd".
==========
This tells us that you have not read our TOS and don't respect the service.
Consequently account will be deleted.
==========
Not having a homepage at anytime  (hence site displaying "Forbidden" message), or still having original "account created" homepage from 15+ days of your signup date.
Also includes not having a proper website while having uploaded tons of files to your account (hence using host mainly as a file host and not a content website host as it should be).
==========
QUESTION: Are porn sites allowed?
ANSWER: Yes they are totally allowed.
==========
With exception of having an intention to use 110mb as a redirecting agent to another site.
IE: When they land on your keyword spammed 110mb page -- they  get redirected to another site.
Also child porn (naked humans under 18) is prohibited.
==========
QUESTION: Am I allowed to host an image hosting script (like imageshack.us) where it allows my visitors to upload their images?
ANSWER: No.
==========
Because you'll be violating above TOS point of using account mainly as file storage medium, where the site contains no "real" content.
QUESTION: Am I allowed to offer business opportunities or sell products or turn my site  for money-making purposes?
ANSWER: Yes.
Ofcourse give people a break and don't promote stuff that's an obvious scam or stuff you don't even understand how it works.
==========
Sure you want an extra on the side.
So then go to money making/business forums and learn about legit ways of income streams.
==========
QUESTION: Is my personal info safe with you?
Are you going to sell my email address?
ANSWER: You've gotta be kidding.
People are so busy running their life's, the last thing  you, we or anyone needs is worries to stop leaking of personal info and sharing/selling of email where ones guaranteed to get infinite spam.
Which further takes time to filter.
==========
Your privacy is totally respected with 0 interest now or the future to reveal your details to anyone.
QUESTION: Will my site ever get deleted?
==========
ANSWER: Yes if it's inactive for 90 days.
And definitely yes if you violate any of above covered points.
==========
Furthermore rudeness to staff members for support will NOT be tolerated under any conditions.
And in repetitive occurrences your IP will be banned from 110mb network & account deleted.
==========
