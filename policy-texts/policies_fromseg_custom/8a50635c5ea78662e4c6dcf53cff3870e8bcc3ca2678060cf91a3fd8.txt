Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments.
Please read the fund facts and prospectus, which contains detailed investment information, before investing.
==========
The indicated rates of return (other than for each money market fund) are the historical annual compounded total returns for the period indicated including changes in unit value and reinvestment of distributions.
The indicated rate of return for each money market fund is an annualized historical yield based on the seven-day period ended as indicated and annualized in the case of effective yield by compounding the seven day return and does not represent an actual one year return.
The indicated rates of return do not take into account sales, redemption, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any unitholder that would have reduced returns.
Mutual funds are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer and are not guaranteed or insured.
==========
Their values change frequently.
There can be no assurances that a money market fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per unit at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment will be returned to you.
Past performance may not be repeated.

==========
Please read the prospectus or the summary document(s) before investing.
ETFs are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.
ETF units are bought and sold at market price on a stock exchange and brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
TD ETFs do not seek to return any predetermined amount at maturity.
Index returns do not represent TD ETF returns.
The indicated rates of return are the historical total returns for the periods including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account redemption, commission charges or income taxes payable by any unitholder that would have reduced returns.
==========
Past performance may not be repeated.
The performance of an Index fund is expected to be lower than the performance of its respective index.
Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Comparisons to indices have limitations because indices have volatility and other material characteristics that may differ from a particular mutual fund.
==========
Target distribution rates are based on Net Asset Value (NAV) per unit (PU) for the Fund(s).
The target distribution rates will change with the changes in the series NAVPU or monthly distribution per unit.
This is a target distribution only, is not guaranteed, may be adjusted from time to time without notice and is not a prediction of future distributions.
The most recent actual monthly distributions per unit are available on the TDAM website at tdassetmanagement.com 
The payment of distributions should not be confused with a fund’s performance, rate of return or yield.
==========
If a distribution paid by a fund is greater than the performance of the fund, the difference will be deducted from your invested capital.
Capital gains taxes deferred will be payable when the units of a fund are sold or to some extent when their adjusted cost base goes below zero.
Return of capital (ROC) distributions do not constitute part of a fund’s rate of return or yield.
ROC reduces the adjusted cost base of the units to which it relates.
Graphs are only used to illustrate the effects of the compound growth rate and do not reflect future values of any fund or returns on investment of any fund.
==========
Regulatory restrictions limit publishing performance returns for funds or portfolios with a history of less than one year.

TD Guaranteed Investment Funds II Disclosure:
TD Guaranteed Investment Funds II ("TD GIF II") policies are Individual Variable Insurance Contracts issued by ivariTM and are managed by TDAM.
ivari is the issuer of the TD GIF II contract.
As of March 11th, 2009, TD GIF II was closed to new policies and as of April 15th, 2009, all existing policies were closed to additional deposits.
A complete description of the key features of TD GIF II is contained in the TD GIF II Annuity Policy and Information Folder.
In the event of any discrepancy between the Annuity Policy and Information Folder and this document, the Annuity Policy and Information Folder take precedence.
==========
Any amount that is allocated to a segregated fund is invested at the risk of the Contract Owner and may increase or decrease in value.
When entering into an Individual Variable Insurance Contract, and purchasing TD GIF II, investors are depositing money to their contract and are not buying units of the TD Mutual Funds and therefore do not possess any of the rights and privileges of the unitholders of such funds.
The performance of the TD GIF II will be slightly less than that of the underlying TD Mutual Funds due to the cost of the guarantee and benefit feature.
Past performance is not indicative of future performance and investment returns will fluctuate.
TD Mutual Funds are offered by TDAM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank.

The terms of each account agreement and other agreements that apply to your Payment Card and Account including any amendments (collectively, your “Account Agreement”) supplement these Terms.
The Account Agreement continues to apply to your Payment Card and Account including when you add your Payment Card or use it in the Wallet.
The Account Agreement may describe, for example, the applicable fees, interest, and other terms and conditions that apply when you use a Payment Card.
Nothing in these Terms changes your responsibilities under the Account Agreement.
In the event of any conflict between these Terms and your Account Agreement, your Account Agreement applies.

You understand that your use of the Wallet will also be subject to agreements or terms of use with the relevant Wallet provider ("Wallet Provider") or other third parties such as wireless companies or data service providers ("Other Third Parties").
TD Bank is not responsible for the Wallet Provider or Other Third Parties, and in no event shall such terms and conditions between you and the Wallet Provider or any Other Third Party be binding on TD Bank or impose any additional obligations, or obligations inconsistent with the terms and conditions of these Terms, upon TD Bank whatsoever.

If you want to add a Payment Card to the Wallet, you must follow the procedures adopted by the Wallet Provider and any further procedures we adopt.
You understand that not all Payment Cards are eligible to be added to the Wallet.
We may not allow you to add a Payment Card to the Wallet if we cannot authenticate the Payment Card or if we otherwise suspect that there may be fraud associated with the Payment Card or the Account.
The Wallet allows you and anyone else who has access to and use of your Device to make purchases using a Payment Card that has been added to the Wallet wherever the Wallet is accepted, subject to Payment Card activation and pre-set limits (which are subject to change).
When you use your Payment Card through the Wallet to transact with a merchant, it is the same as if you swiped, inserted, waved, tapped or otherwise presented your physical Payment Card or signed the credit card slip or electronic signature device presented by the merchant and/or inputted your personal identification number to transact.
Wallet transactions will be added to your credit card Account billing statement or, in the case of debit card transactions, your transaction history and Account statements (as applicable).

==========
You will be required to download and install a separate companion app which works with the TD app for smartphone (the "TD MySpend app") in order to use TD MySpend.
Eligibility Requirements

From time to time, TD may establish or modify certain eligibility requirements for the use of TD MySpend.
For example, only certain TD accounts are eligible for use with TD MySpend and only certain mobile devices and their respective operating systems support TD MySpend.
In addition, you may not be eligible to use TD MySpend if any one or more of your accounts are not in good standing.
To be eligible to use MySpend, all your TD accounts must be in good standing.
You can use your TD Canadian dollar personal chequing, savings and credit card accounts to track and display your spending in MySpend.
Business accounts are not eligible.
Changing Your Preference Settings

As noted above in the Privacy Terms, TD MySpend has preference settings that allow you to personalize your TD MySpend experience including the ability to disable any of your Eligible Accounts that you no longer want to display in TD MySpend.
In addition, you may adjust the settings in the operating system of your mobile device to turn off the receipt of Notifications.
==========
We encourage you to visit the FAQ for more information on all preferences available to you in TD MySpend.
Certain Information Will Be Displayed On Your Mobile Device

Once you sign up and register for TD MySpend, each of your Eligible Accounts will automatically be used in TD MySpend.
In addition, after you sign up and register for TD MySpend, if you add another account to your customer profile (which is eligible for use with TD MySpend), it will automatically be added for use with TD MySpend.
==========
You may disable any one or more of your Eligible Accounts from being displayed by going to your preferences and turning off the Eligible Account you wish to remove.
Note that we will continue to collect and analyze transaction data from disabled Eligible Accounts in case you change your mind and decide to display the Eligible Account in TD MySpend.
We encourage you to visit the FAQ for more information on all preferences available to you in TD MySpend.
Joint Accounts And Authorized User(s)

	If one or more of your Eligible Accounts is a TD joint chequing or savings account or a TD credit card account with authorized user(s), each joint account holder or authorized user, as the case may be, will be able to use TD MySpend on their mobile device, and will receive the same information about your joint account or TD credit card account that you receive through TD MySpend (including updates on the average or typical monthly spend and all Notifications associated with the account).
Even if you change your preferences in TD MySpend to disable a joint chequing or savings account, or disable a TD credit card account with authorized user(s), the joint account holder or authorized user will continue to be able to use the Eligible Account with TD MySpend and receive information provided by TD MySpend which is specific to the Eligible Account.
If you contact TD to make account ownership change(s) to either remove a joint account holder from your joint TD chequing or savings account or to remove an authorized user from your TD credit card account, it may take up to three (3) business days for the account ownership changes to appear in TD MySpend.
This means that a joint account holder or an authorized user may be able to view the account in TD MySpend until the corresponding change is made in TD MySpend.
Information Provided By TD MySpend Including Notifications

As noted above in the Privacy Terms, you will receive Notifications when you make a purchase from an Eligible Account.
Once you sign up and register for TD MySpend, you will automatically begin receiving Notifications (unless you refuse to grant permission to the operating system of your mobile device).
You may turn off Notifications at any time by adjusting the notification settings contained in the operating system of your mobile device.
If you receive a Notification of a transaction that you do not recognize, notify TD AT ONCE at 1-866-222-3456.
We encourage you to visit the FAQ for more information on how to change your operating system settings.
TD is not responsible for the failure to provide you with information (including Notifications) through TD MySpend at any time.
Keep in mind that you may not receive a Notification for each transaction (please visit our FAQ for more information) and you may not receive Notifications if your wireless service carrier or Internet service provider does not provide service in certain geographic areas.
You should not rely on Notifications to confirm the final amount of any transaction as there could be transactions for amounts that are larger than your final purchase when it is actually posted to your Eligible Account.
==========
For example, hotel and car rental services may post an authorized amount to your TD credit card account to accommodate for security deposits and gas stations may post authorized amounts to accommodate for a pre-determined amount of gas.
These amounts are then adjusted when posted to your TD credit card account, after the authorization date, when the security deposits are released from the hotel/car rental service or you do not spend the pre-determined amount of gas.
You should not rely on Notifications for the final amount of a TD credit card transaction if you made a purchase in foreign currency as there could be a change in the initial value of the transaction (that is provided to you through a Notification) to when the transaction is posted to your Eligible Account.
This is due to the fact that the foreign exchange rate may have changed between the time of the Notification and the time the foreign currency transaction is posted to your Eligible Account.
==========
TD Agreements; TD MySpend Should Not Be Used As A Monthly Statement

The terms of the agreements that you entered into or may enter with TD for your Eligible Account(s) or other products or services (as such agreements are amended or replaced by TD from time to time, the "TD Agreements"), apply to your use of TD MySpend.
These Terms are in addition to and do not in any way amend or replace TD Agreements that apply to your Eligible Account(s) or particular product or service, unless we have specifically advised you in these Terms.
You should not rely on the information provided by TD MySpend (including Notifications) for transactional or record keeping purposes as it is provided solely for informational purposes only and is not an official TD statement of account (please refer to sections 19 and 20 for more detail).
While TD MySpend is a helpful tool that will provide support to track your monthly spend from your Eligible Accounts, you must at all times continue to meet your obligations under your TD Agreements including your obligations to review statements or otherwise review all account activity and promptly tell us about any errors or omissions.
TD MySpend and the information it provides is not a monthly statement nor should it be relied on to review your monthly account activity in order to fulfill your obligations under your TD Agreements.
