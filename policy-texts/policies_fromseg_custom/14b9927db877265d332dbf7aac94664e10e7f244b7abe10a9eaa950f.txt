        from other Polar services.

        associated with your information in order to improve Polar’s
        services and the ads delivered by Polar and/or our partners.

How long we retain data


We normally retain any personally identifiable data for a period of 36
        months, or until we receive and process a request for deletion from you.
We may retain anonymized and/or aggregated data indefinitely.
How we identify and authenticate you


When you visit a website or app that makes use of Polar’s MediaVoice platform, we may set a first party cookie.
This cookie contains a
        randomly generated user ID that identifies your browser.
This user ID is
        sent with tracking data we collect (see above: “What data we collect”).
Your possession of this user ID is necessary in order for us to be able
        to link any data we have with you individually, both for routine
        operations (such as ad serving) and the exercise of data rights (should
        they apply).
If you choose to delete Polar’s first party cookie, Polar has no
        means of recovering it.
Subsequent visits will result in a new user ID
        being generated.
