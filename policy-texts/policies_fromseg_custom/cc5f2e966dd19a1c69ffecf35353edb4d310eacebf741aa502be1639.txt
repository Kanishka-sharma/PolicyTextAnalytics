==========
Types and Uses of Collected Information.
Shopalyst collects two types of information about you:
			
a.Personal Data.
Personal Data is information that identifies a specific person.
==========
When you engage in certain activities
			via the Shopalyst Service, including but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or otherwise participating
			in the Shopalyst Service (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about
			yourself.
If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal
			information about yourself, such as your name, address (including zip code), email address and/or telephone number.
When
			you enroll in the Shopalyst Service, we may also ask you to provide us with additional information, such as credit card
			information.
Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified
			as mandatory and some identified as voluntary.
If you do not provide mandatory information for a particular Identification
			Activity, you will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity with the Shopalyst Service.
Depending on
			the Identification Activity, we may not re-ask you for Personal Data if such is already stored with us.
==========
We may receive information about you from our partner sites where you use the Shopalyst Service, or third parties.

			Connect, by "following," "liking," adding the Company application, linking your account to the Shopalyst Service, etc.,

This information could include,
			but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary
			to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information
			you have made public in connection with that service.

			and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to
			invite your friends to use the Shopalyst Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join, if
			applicable.

			partners) use cookies scripts, pixel tags, etags, web beacons and similar technologies (collectively referred to as â€œcookiesâ€)
			to collect information automatically from your device (such as your PC, tablet or other mobile device).
These cookies
			are then used to display the most appropriate and relevant advertising to you on third party websites and apps (including
			social media platforms) or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement.
==========
They stay on your computer unless you
			delete them and they remember that you have visited a website.
We may also allow third parties with whom we have partnered
			to set cookies on the Shopalyst Service which enable that third party to analyse your visit to the Shopalyst Service and
			collect certain information regarding purchases of their products through our website.
The types of information collected
			by such cookies may include: shopping cart information, what product pages have been viewed, and whether a product has
			been purchased.
b.Non-Personal Data.

			Service or otherwise participating in the Shopalyst Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the Shopalyst
			Service, the type of browser you are using, mobile carrier information, mobile device information, or general and/or aggregated
			location data that does constitute Personally Identifiable Information.

			and administer the Shopalyst Service, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and
			cooperate with law enforcement activities.
We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service
			Providers to measure the overall effectiveness of our products and services.
3.
==========
Sharing of Personal Data.
We will not sell or share your Personal Data with other parties except as provided below:
			
a.Authorized Third Party Service Providers.

			subject to our control.
==========

==========
d.As required by law.
We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data as required by law and when we believe that
			disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process
			served on us, enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, Terms of Service or other agreements or protect the rights, property
			or safety of the Shopalyst Service, users of the Shopalyst Service or others.
4.
==========
Customer End Users.
As part of the provision of the Shopalyst Service to Customers, Shopalyst collects certain information
			and data about Customer End Users as determined by the applicable Customer (â€œCustomer End User Dataâ€).
Shopalyst does
			not control or otherwise approve any messages or requests for Customer End User Data made by a Customer to a Customer
			End User.
Customer End Users should be aware that a Customer can request such Customer End User Data from them in order
			to use the Customerâ€™s products or services and that Customer End User Data may then be included in information given to
			Shopalyst or through your use of the Shopalyst Service.
==========
Therefore, Customer End Users should review the privacy policy
			of a Customerâ€™s applicable product or service to assess the security of any information a Customer End User discloses.
To the extent that Shopalyst receives any Customer End User Data, Shopalyst shall make reasonable efforts, consistent
			with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to maintain the confidentiality of such Customer End User Data.
Shopalyst has no
			direct relationship to the Customer End Users whose Customer End User Data it processes and such Customer End User who
			seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Customer End User Data should direct such query to
			the applicable Customer for removal.
In the event such Customer requests removal of such applicable Customer End User
			Data from Shopalyst, if applicable, Shopalyst will respond to such request within one month; provided that (i) such period
			may be extended by up to two additional months when necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests
			and (ii) Shopalyst shall inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the
			reasons for the delay.
5.
==========
Customer End User Data.
Shopalyst will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer End User Data
			except as provided in Shopalystâ€™s applicable agreement with Customer, or as may be required by law.
Shopalyst acknowledges
			that Customer End Users have the right to access their personal information.
If Personal Data pertaining to a Customer
			End User has been submitted to us by a Customer and a Customer End User wishes to exercise any rights it may have to access,
			correct, amend, or delete such data, Customer End User should inquire with the Customer directly.
Because Shopalyst personnel
			have limited ability to access data our Customers may submit to the Shopalyst Service, if a Customer End User wishes to
			make a request directly to Shopalyst, please provide the name of the Customer who submitted your data to the Shopalyst
			Service.
We will refer your request to such Customer and will support them as needed in responding to your request.
