Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services
We deliver advertisements from hundreds of Advertisers across a multitude of Digital Content Provider properties.
When you visit one of these properties, our automated system may collect “click stream data” related to your visit to the property.
Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as your IP address, content or pages viewed, the date and time at which that content was viewed and any interaction with content and advertisements on those properties.
Technologies used to collect this click stream data include cookies and Web beacons.
In order to improve performance, we augment our click stream data with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from Digital Content Providers and other partners.
This anonymous data may include such things as postal code, age and gender.
It may also include GPS location provided by Digital Content Providers with mobile properties.
