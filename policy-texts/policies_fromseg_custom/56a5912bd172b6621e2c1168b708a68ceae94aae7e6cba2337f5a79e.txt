Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes
Rodale Inc. may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request.
If there is a change of control in Rodale's business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your PII potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information.
==========
You acknowledge that Rodale is located in the United States of America ("U.S.") and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S.
Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees
Rodale deploys mobile marketing campaigns and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device.
You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges.
You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device.
Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device.
You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving text messages or emails to your mobile device at the time you register and with each message or email you receive.
==========
Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to Rodale or a third-party campaign operator.
An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device.
Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice.
When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, Rodale and the third-party campaign operator collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.
