Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Advertising UsesOur Services, our Partners and some of our Service Providers utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other tracking technologies which help us provide, secure and improve our Services, personalize your experience and monitor the performance of our activities and campaigns.
Our Services also utilize advertising for third party services and products.
==========
We and our advertising Partners use certain data about you in order to improve our advertising practices and make the ads we deliver more effective, relevant and enjoyable, including by deploying contextual, interest-based and other types of advertising, as well as targeting, ad measurement and attribution systems.
The ads and content we or our advertising partners deliver may be shown within our Services or through other channels, such as third-party websites and applications.
Such data includes your IP address, cookies, pixels and other unique identifiers, data related to your connected Social Network Account, and other demographic and interests-based information that we or our advertising partners may have received from or about you, based on your consent or another legal basis (i.e., as required in order to provide you with our respective services, or based on the legitimate interests that we described in Section 2 above).
==========
When you use our Services, we may share information that we collect from you with our identity partners/service providers, including LiveRamp Inc.
LiveRamp returns an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online and cross-channel advertising, and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising.
The information shared for such activities may include your email (in hashed and non-identifying form), IP address and information about your browser or operating system.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your data by our advertising partners and networks.
We recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information.

A list of the cookies and other tracking technologies we use, as well as additional information concerning our advertising partners and networks (and their policies), can be found here: https://www.openweb.com/cookies/ 
Our practices with respect to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals: DNT signals are the result of a standardization initiative from 2009 to create a standard signal which could be broadcasted by any web browser, and read by websites accessed through such browser, to note an individual’s preference not to be tracked online.
While the working group assigned to this standardization initiative by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was disbanded in 2019, the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) still requires website publishers/operators to disclose whether they respond to web browsers’ ‘do not track’ (DNT) signals.
Similar to most websites, the OpenWeb.com website does not change its practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from a browser, as unfortunately these are, from a technical perspective, not sufficiently reliable or standardized for us to warrant full adherence.
==========
We do recommend the use of cookies for an optimal user experience of our Services, but if you choose to remove or block them we definitely respect your choice.
Modern web browsers typically allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them.
You may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies entirely through your browser settings.
==========
OpenWeb supports initiatives of greater transparency and control for users, and offers the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive: If you reside in the EU and do not want to receive interest-based ads displayed by OpenWeb, you can disable the display of such ads by visiting the EDAA consumer choice page at www.youronlinechoices.eu.
You may also use the NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from other NAI-approved member companies, and for mobile opt outs, the NAI provides instructions to engage system-level opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.
If you reside in California and wish to opt-out of the “sale” of your personal information, as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), please follow the instructions in Section ‎8 below.
==========
Please note that opting out will not prevent you from seeing ads sourced from us on our Services or on other websites, but it will affect the types of ads that you will see.
These ads will no longer be tailored to your interests and instead will be chosen based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e. contextually based ads).
==========
Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually.
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the EDAA consumer choice page, your-opt out may not be effective.
