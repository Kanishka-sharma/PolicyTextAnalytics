PRIVACY FOR ADACADO TECHNOLOGY
In this section, learn how you can change how you receive online advertisements by Adacado, followed by information regarding how Adacado uses and protects your data.
Purpose of Adacado technology
One Person Health, Inc. (referred to as Adacado) provides a technology, enabling media companies, advertising agencies and advertisers to deliver dynamic and interactive campaigns via advertising display ad units.
You may encounter Adacado technology when an Adacado client purchases or sells online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when an Adacado client places an Adacado web beacon on its website, which you visit.
Adacado uses the information collected by Adacado technology to help make the online advertisements you see to be more of interest to you.
==========
This is done for ad delivery and reporting purposes, and for other purposes described in this policy.
Adacado makes advertisements more relevant through customization that reflects your recent browsing behavior.
You can choose not to have Adacado use information based on your browsing behaviour when delivering advertisements to you.
==========
The use of cookies and our technologies
Adacado technology may automatically collect certain information through the use of cookies and web beacons.
This information is used for conversion tracking and to measure the success of online advertising campaigns, and the campaigns of Adacado clients.
Specifically, cookies correlate whether you saw an ad impression or chose to view an ad from that impression, with whether you later went to another page on the Adacado site or on a client’s website.
Cookies and web beacons are widely used together across the internet to record user preferences and other information to make the services you receive operate with increased capability and convenience.
Cookies are used to both contain information about your browsing behavior (if you choose), and may be used to contain whether you do not wish to have advertisements delivered based on your interests.
==========
However, while cookies are very useful, they are rudimentary.
It’s important to note that each browser you use maintains its own cookies and each browser acts independently from all other browsers that you use.
==========
Adacado does not link information between your browsers.
Keep in mind that (1) options you choose regarding advertisements from Adacado need to be set for each browser that you use, and (2) if you have chosen not to receive interest-based advertisements, you must not delete the cookies on your browser for the Adacado domain because Adacado would not know your preference.
Note that if you are using an ad blocker product, you may need to temporarily enable your ad blocker to manage your preferences here.
==========
Ways to change how you receive advertisements from Adacado
We respect your rights and encourage you to exercise your rights as a consumer of online advertising.
Here are some ways you can exercise your rights:
(a) Opt out of all Interest-based Advertising from Adacado
If you do not want advertising served to you to use the Adacado technology cookie, click the button below.
This operation will save a setting in a cookie associated with your browser saying not to deliver interest-based advertisements.
==========
Note that advertisements may still be delivered to your web browser on behalf of companies using Adacado technology but those advertisements may not be as relevant to you because the advertisement request will only use information that is automatically transmitted through an Internet communication and not information collected using an Adacado cookie on your computer.
(b) Explicit consent
In some jurisdictions where you receive online advertising, your explicit consent is required before personal information about you can be saved or used.
Adacado technology assures your consent wishes are respected.
In those jurisdictions (eg European Union), Adacado technology expects to receive confirmation of your explicit consent from the advertiser or from the site on which the advertisement is to be delivered (the publisher).
If your explicit consent is not received, Adacado technology will not deliver an interest-based advertisement.
Requesting your consent is the responsibility of the advertiser or the publisher – please set and manage your wishes directly with them.
Regardless, from consent-requiring jurisdictions, Adacado technology will never deliver an interest-based advertisement without your explicit consent.
(c) To request that we erase all interest-based data related to you, to make other requests regarding your rights, or if you have questions:  
Send an email detailing your request to privacy@adacado.com.
How Adacado technology processes information related to ads you see
Using cookies and web beacons, Adacado technology saves information inside a cookie on a device associated with your browser.
==========
Inside the cookie is a simple, unique visitor identifier.
Note that uniquely-identifying information about you such as your name, address or, email address is never used or saved.
==========
Adacado uses this visitor identifier to associate your browsing history and information about Adacado advertisements you have seen.
Browsing history is information about how you may interact with an advertiser’s website.
==========
For example, if you were interested in and displayed one or more products over time, or visited a category page describing a grouping of an advertiser’s products, Adacado would record that information.
Adacado also records advertisement delivery history which is when what what advertisements were delivered to you, and whether and on what elements of the advertisements you clicked (e.g., clicking the advertisement or clicking next and previous).
==========
When Adacado technology receives a request to deliver an advertisement, it may use the above information to deliver an interest-based advertisement.
However, if consent is not provided (for consent-requiring jurisdictions), or you have opted out of Adacado advertising, you will not be delivered an interest-based ad.
In such cases you will receive a generic ad that is not based on any information related to you.
Adacado’s only connection to you is through your visitor identifier.
It describes no information about you and is used solely as a link to browsing history and advertisement delivery history.
==========
By exercising your rights to your information as described in an earlier section of this document, your visitor identifier is deleted, thereby severing the link to our data and making it anonymous.
Data Adacado collects and uses
We collect data related to your browsing activity and advertisements delivered to you through cookies or visitor id-based transactions that record:events related to your activity on our advertising partner’s website such as the products you viewed or areas such as category pages.
events regarding your ad serving activity such as the advertisements that were displayed to you and how you interacted with them such as clicks and next/previous events.
==========
information related to your device such as device type, operating system, version but no personally identified information.
non-precise geo-location information that may identify you as being in a country, region or city, for example to serve only advertisements for products that are only locally available to you.
==========
For consent-requiring jurisdictions, we do not use or save IP addresses unless your explicit consent is provided.
Information Adacado technology does not collect
sensitive information such as political views, health, religion.
==========
hardware-based identifiers such as MAC address.
anything that identifies who you are such as your email address, your address, your name.
==========
