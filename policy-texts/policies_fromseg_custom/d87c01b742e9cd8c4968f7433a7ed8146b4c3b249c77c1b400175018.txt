INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Information: For the purposes of this privacy policy, ‘personal information’ is taken to mean any information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, e-mail address, or mobile number).
This does not include ‘aggregate’ information, which includes data that we collect about the use of our application and our services.
This privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information in any way.
==========
Usage Data: Snapchat collects the following personal information about its users: username, password, email, phone number, and Facebook ID for the purpose of finding friends on the service.
Additionally, we do collect usage information.
This information does not identify individual users, but allows us to collect information regarding how users access and utilize the mobile application (“Usage Data”).
==========
Once a user has downloaded and started using Snapchat, we automatically aggregate information such as the type of device used, its specific operating system, and its device identifier (UDID).
We use all of this information to investigate trends and to restructure and improve the functional aspects of the Snapchat application.
We do not ask for, track, or access any location-specific information from your device at any time while you are using the Snapchat application.
Message Data: When you send or receive messages using the Snapchat services, we temporarily process and store your images and videos in order to provide our services.
==========
Although we attempt to delete image data as soon as possible after the message is transmitted, we cannot guarantee that the message contents will be deleted in every case.
For example, users may take a picture of the message contents with another imaging device or capture a screenshot of the message contents on the device screen.
Consequently, we are not able to guarantee that your messaging data will be deleted in all instances.
Messages, therefore, are sent at the risk of the user.
Hardware Data: We collect the MAC (Media Access Control) address of your mobile device, which we use internally for analytics.
We use this data in aggregate.
