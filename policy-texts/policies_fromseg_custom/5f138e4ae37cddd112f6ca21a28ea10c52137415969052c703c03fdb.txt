Privacy Policy
Scope
Last Updated:  January 14, 2009

AdAdvisor services ("the Services") place a cookie containing non-personally identifiable information on a user's computer.
A cookie is a small file created by a Web server, delivered through a Web browser and placed on a user's computer.
AdAdvisor cookies enable Web sites using the Services to recognize users when they return to those Web sites.
The Services facilitate the delivery of the most relevant offers to the right consumers while both protecting the privacy of consumers and offering a choice about participating in such activities.
==========
The Services enable advertising clients to customize online display advertisements.
Information Collection and Use
The cookies used by the Services do not contain any personally identifiable information.
Instead, the cookie contains anonymous, non-personally identifiable categories of information which are derived as a result of a user's registration through one of our registration partners.
The non-personally identifiable categories of information in our cookies enable our clients to create offers which are more likely to be of interest to their users and better customize the user experience.
==========
Opt-Out and Policy Updates
The Services also offer users a way to opt-out.
Users who do not wish to have advertisements tailored based on the information stored in an AdAdvisor cookie can opt-out by clicking here.
The AdAdvisor opt-out works by replacing the existing AdAdvisor cookie with a new cookie that clearly indicates that the user has elected to opt-out of the Services.
==========
Users should be advised that opting out of the Services does not mean the AdAdvisor cookie has been deleted.
Moreover, if the opt-out cookie is deleted by a user, the user buys a new computer or the user changes the Web browser, the user will be required to repeat the opt-out process

The AdAdvisor privacy policy may be updated periodically.
Any material changes to the AdAdvisor privacy will be disclosed on this page.
