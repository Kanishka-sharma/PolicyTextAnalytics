==========
All Internet Users - Cookies, Web Beacons, Internet Protocol (IP) Address, Aggregate Information - (Top)
3.4.1.1.
Cookies
Like many other websites, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain web pages to help analyze our web page flow and measure promotional effectiveness.
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.
==========
This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our website and services.
A few important things you should know about cookies:

FWH offers certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
FWH uses cookies to better your website experience.
FWH uses cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.
==========
Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the websites that FWH does not control.
(For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)
Cookies are also used on mobile devices to run the SUBWAY® App.
==========
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.
However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of the Sites if cookies are disabled.
If you use Sites that employ Flash Player, a small Flash Cookie may be used.
The purpose of using these cookies is to store your flash player preferences and to enhance your browsing experience.
Flash cookies are stored on your computer in a similar way that standard cookies are stored on your computer, except they are stored in a different location.
For that reason, it is not possible to block or manage Flash Cookies directly from your browser.
For additional information, and in order to manage or delete Flash Cookies, please visit Adobe's website by clicking here.
3.4.1.2.
==========
Web Beacons
FWH uses web beacons, also called “web bugs,” “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs, to help manage FWH’s online advertising and promotions.
Used in combination with cookies, a web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which is placed on a website or in an email, that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the email.
When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a website to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values.
==========
Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a website.
A web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the website.
Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking the user's activity.
The web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.
FWH uses its web beacons to track which advertisements and promotions bring users to FWH’s website.
This information does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address.
3.4.1.3.
==========
Internet Protocol (“IP”) Addresses and Log Files
An IP address is associated with your computer or mobile device's connection to the internet.
FWH may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with FWH’s server, to administer the Sites and to maintain contact with you as you navigate through the Sites.
Your computer's IP address also may be used to provide you with information based upon your navigation through the Sites.
==========
FWH does not link IP addresses to any Personal Information.
Similarly, log file information is automatically reported by your mobile or other access device each time you access the SUBWAY® App.
When you register a SUBWAY® account, the SUBWAY® App may automatically record certain information whenever you use the SUBWAY® App.
The log files may include information such as your user request, IP address, browser type, the number of times you access the SUBWAY® App and other such information.
3.4.1.4.
==========
Anonymous and Aggregated Information
Anonymized and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Sites.
Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and FWH may use such information in a number of ways, including internal analysis, data analytics and research.
We also may share anonymized or aggregated information with third parties for our or their purposes, but none of this information will allow anyone to identify you or to determine anything else personal about you.

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
FWH is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Sites for third-party purposes, and that is why FWH provides the DAA opt-out link above.

FWH does not sell Personal Information to third parties.
FWH may share Personal Information with our service providers, consultants and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested.
Except as described in this Privacy Statement, FWH will not share Personal Information with a third party unless a customer or prospective employee requests or consents to such disclosure, or disclosure is required or authorized by law.
Payment information will be used and shared only to effectuate your order and may be stored by our service provider for purposes of future orders.
FWH requires our service providers to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on behalf of FWH, including to provide at least the same level of protection as required by the Privacy Shield Principles, not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which FWH retained them and to notify FWH if they make a determination they can no longer comply with that obligation.
