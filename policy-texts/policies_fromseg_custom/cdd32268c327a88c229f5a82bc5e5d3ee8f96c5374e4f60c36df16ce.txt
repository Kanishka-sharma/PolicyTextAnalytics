Teachers and Search Engines.
Notwithstanding other
terms of this agreement, we grant the right to teachers to print pages
from the Site for distribution to students, provided that proper
attribution is given to the URL on the Site where the material
originated.
We also grant the operators of search engines permission
to use robots to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of
creating publicly-available searchable indexes of the materials, but
not caches or archives of the materials.
Search engines are expected
to follow the guidelines set forth in the robots.txt file that we provide.
Except as
specifically provided in this paragraph, you agree not to use or
launch any automated system, including without limitation, robots,
spiders, offline readers, or like devices, that accesses the Site in a
manner which sends more request messages to the Site server in any
given period of time than a typical human would normally produce in
the same period by using a conventional on-line Web browser to read,
view, and submit materials.
SRI reserves the right to revoke the
exceptions granted in this paragraph, either generally or in specific
cases, as well as the right to deny service to any user found
violating the provisions of this paragraph.

Use or misuse of the Marks without advance
written consent from SRI or the respective Mark's owner is expressly
prohibited.
You shall not use any mark in any manner that is likely

Further, to the extent that third party
