P3P Work suspended
13 November 2006: After a successful Last Call, the P3P Working Group decided to publish the P3P 1.1 Specification as a Working Group Note to give P3P 1.1 a provisionally final state.
The P3P Specification Working Group took this step as there was insufficient support from current Browser implementers for the implementation of P3P 1.1.
The P3P 1.1 Working Group Note contains all changes from the P3P 1.1 Last Call.
The Group thinks that P3P 1.1 is now ready for implementation.
It is not excluded that W3C will push P3P 1.1 until Recommendation if there is sufficient support for implementation.
On the other hand, P3P keeps being the basis of a number of research directions in the area of privacy world wide.
One might cite the PRIME Project as well as the Policy aware Web.
Many other approaches also follow the descriptive metadata approach started by P3P.
Such projects are invited to send email to <rigo@w3.org> to be listed here.
