Your browsing activity, including what content and ads you click on
The URL of the page you’re visiting

Activities on our advertiser’s Web sites
Information about your browser and device, such as device type, operating system and display settings

Efficient Frontier may use this information for the following purposes:

Improve our products and services
Provide anonymous individual and/or aggregate auditing, research and reporting to our advertiser customers
Understand market trends
Provide consumers with relevant content and advertising on behalf of our customers, including advertising based on consumers’ previous activities and interests
Optimize the delivery of advertisements and content on behalf of our customers

In providing our advertising products and services to our customers, Efficient Frontier does not purposefully collect personally identifiable information.
Cookies
Efficient Frontier uses cookies to provide you with relevant content and advertising.
A cookie is an element of data stored on your computer so that a Web site can identify a browser from visit to visit.
Cookies may also be used to store user preferences, as well as maintain a user’s login state to a website.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
You can also set your browser to reject all cookies; though by rejecting all cookies you may limit some of the functionality on the websites you are visiting.
==========
Web Beacons
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/pixels) that help us better manage content on the Web sites of our customers and partners by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded, often invisible, on Web pages.
==========
Because our products and services are not designed to collect personally identifiable information in providing our advertising products and services, we do not purposefully tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personally identifiable information.
Third Party Data
Customers of our advertising products and services have the ability to associate the information we collect on their behalf with information from third party providers.
By associating the information we collect with information from third parties, we can help our customers enrich the profile they maintain about you to provide you more relevant content and advertisements.
The information we obtain for our customers from third party providers is anonymous in nature and, even when associated with the information we collect, does not allow for Efficient Frontier to identify or contact you.
Information Sharing
Efficient Frontier may share information with our customers and partners.
For example, we may share the number of ad views, ad clicks and content views on those customers’ and partners’ Web sites in order to help them calculate the payments due to them.
==========
Efficient Frontier does not provide personally identifiable information to our customers and partners.
In providing our advertising products and services, Efficient Frontier may leverage service providers who operate on our behalf.
When acting on our behalf, these service providers collect and use data as described within this policy.
Efficient Frontier may share information as required by law or when we believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or respond to fraud, defend against abuse, or protect the property and safety of Efficient Frontier, our customers and partners, or the public.
==========
Opting Out of Relevant Content and Content
If you do not want Efficient Frontier to show you relevant content and advertisements based on your interests or previous browsing activity, you can opt out here.
By opting out of Efficient Frontier, you are indicating that you no longer want to receive advertising that is optimized by Efficient Frontier based on your previous browsing activity.
By opting out of Efficient Frontier, we will place a cookie on your computer.
You may still receive advertising and content from Efficient Frontier, but it will no longer be optimized based on your previous web activity or interests.
If you delete this opt out cookie, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this opt-out process.
To learn more about how companies use your previous browsing activity to provide you relevant advertising and content, including your options from other companies, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Opt Out Page.
You may be able to modify your browser settings to reject all third-party cookies on your browser.
By doing this, Efficient Frontier will not be able to use your previous browsing information to provide you relevant advertising or content.
Please be aware that selecting this option may prevent you from enjoying relevant advertising or content on the websites you visit.
==========
Please look at your browser’s specific instructions for this option.
Data Retention
We may associate the specific information we collect with a unique browser identifier for up to 180 days from the point at which the data is collected.
Efficient Frontier is not able to use your unique browser identifier to personally identify you.
After 180 days, Efficient Frontier may retain the specific information it collects in aggregated form to provide you relevant content and advertising and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Notification of Changes
If we make a material change to our Advertising Services Policy, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to post those changes on the Efficient Frontier Web site so visitors to our site can be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If at any point we use information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of a prominent notice on our Web site prior to the changes taking effect.
