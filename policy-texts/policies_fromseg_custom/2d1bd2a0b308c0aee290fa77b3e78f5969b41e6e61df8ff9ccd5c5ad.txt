Tableau believes in the importance of thoughtfully handling personal information and is committed to privacy practices that are transparent and compliant.
This Privacy Statement sets out how Tableau uses the personal information we collect and receive about you.
Categories of Personal Information Collected
Tableau collects personal information in support of its mission to help people see and understand their data.
This personal information is collected through a variety of ways.
You provide some information directly to us; we receive some information when you visit our website or use our products and services; and we receive some information from third parties.
The categories of information we collect will depend on your interactions with Tableau: 
Contact information.
==========
Name, employer, title, email address, physical address, phone number, and similar contact info, user names and passwords.
Payment and financial information.
Credit card number, banking information and billing address.
Demographic Information.
Employment status, occupation, region.
==========
If you participate in a Tableau research focus group, then you will have the option to provide further information, such as gender, race, and age.
Inferred and derived information.
==========
Data such as propensities and attributes that Tableau generates to help us understand you and your preferences.
Transaction and registration information.
Information which is generated in the course of your transaction with Tableau, including account information, logins, passwords, and purchase history.
Product registration information, product interest information, transaction information, and in some cases, student verification information.
We may also collect registration information related to your attendance at Tableau events, including travel information, scheduling information, food preferences or allergies, and accessibility requests.
==========
Website data.
When you visit a Tableau website, we may collect online and technical information from your computer or mobile device, (such as your browser type; your Internet Protocol (IP) address and geographic areas derived from your IP address); time-stamped logs regarding access times and duration of visits; the web pages you visited before coming to Tableau websites (referring URL); and other usage data relating to your activities on our Sites, including the pages you request.
Product-related data.
==========
When you use a Tableau product or service, we collect certain information related to your use of our products and services.
Tableau products may collect two types of usage-related data ("Usage Data") depending on your configuration: 

Basic Product Data: "Basic Product Data" refers to technical information about your computer or mobile device (such as device type, operating system type and version, and Tableau-assigned identifiers that help us recognize your device and validate that you are a licensed user), and details about which of our products and product versions you are using.
Product Usage Data: "Product Usage Data" refers to whether or how you use specific features within our products and services, such as the types of data sources you query, the types of visualizations you build, the number of steps in a flow, the type of flow operations you use, and the queries you submit (including natural language queries), as well as hardware properties such as CPU type and amount of RAM.
Customers using an on-premises deployment of a Tableau product or service may be able to configure their systems to avoid transmitting Basic Product Data to us, as described here.
Additionally, our on-premises products and services provide administrative tools that allow customers to opt out of the collection of Product Usage Data through that product or service, as described here.
These options are not available for our hosted products, which automatically collect all Usage Data, as we operate them in our hosted environment.
==========
We may link this information to the personal information we have collected about you and use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, and we may deliver targeted marketing and product information back to you based on this data.
Third party data.
==========
We may receive your personal information from third party suppliers or partners.
If you connect with Tableau accounts on third party social networking sites, we may receive information about your social networking accounts, for example, your name, user name or display name, public profile, and email address.
We may combine information you provide with data we collect automatically and with data we receive from third parties.
==========
Images, video and recordings.
Pictures, videos or audio recordings may be collected by Tableau.
For example, if you attend a Tableau event, your image may be captured in a photo or video.
If you call Tableau customer support, your call may be recorded.
==========
If you decline to provide your personal information or ask us to delete it, we may be unable to continue to provide or support our products or services.
Ways We Use Personal Information

For example, we will use your information to:

Provide and deliver products or services, including software updates;
Operate and improve our operations, systems, products, and services;

Sharing of Personal Information
Tableau works to keep your personal information confidential and secure.
In some circumstances Tableau may share your information with third parties, for example:

We may share your personal information when we have your permission, including when you choose to share information using Tableau Public or post to our Community websites;
We provide personal information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Tableau to provide us with services.
==========
For example, we share contact information with our training and certification partners, our reseller and service partners, our data storage, customer support and marketing vendors, and with our software providers.
These companies may use your personal information to perform services and to help Tableau communicate with you, including making offers from Tableau and our partners.
==========
Tableau maintains contracts with these companies restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal information in compliance with this Privacy Statement and any legal obligations;
If you connect to your third party accounts through our products, we will use that information to authenticate you, enumerate the data sources available to you, download any data you request us to, and download and refresh authentication tokens or persist authentication information such as user names and passwords as necessary to continue to connect to these data;
We may share your contact and transactional information with our current or future affiliates, which may include parent and subsidiary companies, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement;
We will disclose your personal information to comply with legal requirements, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
We also may disclose your personal information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, verify, prevent, enforce compliance with, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; suspected fraud; situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person; protection of the rights and property of Tableau, our agents, customers, or others; violations or suspected violations of our agreements and policies; or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements;
We transfer or disclose your personal information for corporate reasons.
==========
For example, to third parties in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy or similar transaction.
We may also share personal information with our auditors, attorneys or other advisors in the connection with corporate functions; and
Finally, we also share aggregated, anonymized or statistical information about you, including demographics data, with others for a variety of purposes, for example, for improving products and services for Tableau and others.
We may facilitate third party services or ways to share data through third parties, including social media platforms, websites, applications, and services through plug-ins, widgets, buttons, and other third party features on and connected with our websites, communications or products.
Third parties whose services you use in connection with Tableau, such as our training and certification partners, or third parties whose websites we link to, may have information practices that are different from ours.
==========
This Privacy Statement does not apply to the activities of third parties when they are collecting or using data for their own purpose or on behalf of others.
We are not responsible for the activities of these third parties.
We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they use your information.
==========
Storage and Security of Your Personal Information
We have reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to help safeguard your personal information.
However, you should know that no company, including Tableau, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.
To help protect yourself, use a strong password, do not use the same passwords to access your Tableau accounts that you use with other accounts or services, and protect your user names and passwords to help prevent others from accessing your accounts and services.
==========
For more information about Tableau security practices, see https://www.tableau.com/security.
We offer you the ability to post information and exchange ideas through our websites and other services such as Tableau Public.
Because your posts and information shared through Tableau Public are public and can be seen by others, we caution all users to consider what they post and not to disclose any personal information.
Tableau will not be responsible in the event that you disclose personal information in your posts, through our public services or during any other communication with other website users.
==========
Information collected by Tableau or on our behalf may be stored on your computers, on your mobile devices, or on our servers, and may be transferred to, accessed from, or stored and processed in, the United States and other countries including but not limited to Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Japan, India, and China, and any other country where Tableau or its service providers maintain facilities or support centers (a list of Tableau offices can be found here: www.tableau.com/about/contact, including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide protections equivalent to those provided in your home country.
However, we will protect all personal information we obtain in accordance with this Privacy Statement and take reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated lawfully, for instance, by entering into the appropriate back-to-back agreements and, if required, standard contractual clauses or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or other applicable regulator.
Tableau is now a Salesforce company, and as such, we have implemented appropriate safeguards so that Personal Data (as defined in the Salesforce Privacy Statement) shared with Tableau by Salesforce is used solely for our collective business purposes.
==========
In certain circumstances we may retain your personal information after you have closed your account or are no longer actively engaged with Tableau.

You can "unsubscribe" from receiving such messages or tell us you are no longer interested;
We may retain your personal information in order to protect our legal rights, or those of third parties, or to comply with the law;
We may retain personal information about how you have used our products and services in order to improve and develop our business;
If you purchase products or services from us, we may retain your personal information for as long as we need to in order to provide you with customer service, or for compliance purposes, for example, in order to comply with our record keeping requirements;
Tableau may also use and share aggregated, non-personally identifiable data for research, external training and marketing purposes.
==========
Controlling your Personal Information
Our marketing emails permit you to opt-out of receiving further marketing emails.
You may also contact us at customerservice@tableau.com at any time to let us know that you no longer wish to receive marketing emails.
