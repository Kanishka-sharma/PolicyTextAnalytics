==========

Once we have received your information, we will use struct procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see below).
5.4 Data within our walls
The information we collect about people visiting the site is stored in secure environments that are not available to any other individual or party.
==========
We have mechanisms in place to protect data.
One such mechanism is called a "firewall."
A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through.
It safeguards our computer systems and your information.
==========
We also use system and application logs to track all access.
We review these logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.
