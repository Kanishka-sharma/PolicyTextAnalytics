What does adsquare do?
adsquare is not an ad network, data provider or media agency.
adsquare is a digital advertising technology platform.
It provides a transparent and neutral data exchange platform that brings together advertisers and data providers in a fair, secure and privacy-friendly way.
The platform has been built mobile-first and facilitates the creation and execution of audience targeting for digital marketing campaigns.
Our products and features make advertising more relevant for consumers and allow publishers to offer content for no or lower costs.
The platform was built in Germany with user privacy at the core of its design from day one.
Therefore, it complies with European Data Protection Regulations (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) and applicable national data protection laws.
adsquare processes your information in order to ensure advertisers can provide you with relevant advertising based on your interests, affinities and local context and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.
The aim of this is to effectively reduce the amount of ads you see that aren’t beneficial or of interest to you.
An opt-out from targeting would not reduce the amount of ads, it just makes the ads you receive less relevant.
