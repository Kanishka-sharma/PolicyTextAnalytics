With this Privacy Policy, Semasio GmbH intends to inform about the processing of personal data for the website www.semasio.com as well as for the Semasio advertising targeting technology User Intelligence Platform (UIP): 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets standards for data protection in Europe.
This law specifies precisely how personal data may be collected, saved, processed, transferred, or otherwise used.
==========
Semasio’s business model is in compliance with these rules.
To ensure continuous compliance, Semasio very closely follows the development of data protection regulation in Germany and in Europe and immediately reacts to any changes.
Semasio runs the User Intelligence Platform.
==========
It is a technology which turns contacts with digital media users into data points.
These contacts may be with Semasio’s own User Intelligence Platform, or the data may be sourced from third parties.
From these data points information is derived and stored using a cookie set in the users browser for user identification.
Semasio works with partners to deliver advertising based on this data.
In order to communicate our segments to our partners we synchronize cookies with them.
Semasio only works with partner companies on a contractual basis and where the use of data is secure as described below.

Lists of Cookie IDs are sent via our data centers to real-time bidding platforms to deliver advertising campaigns to relevant users.
We do not use the data for automated decision-making or profiling activities.

In some cases, we transfer your information to partners that are located outside of the European Union.
For this, we have special contractual measures in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your data.
In addition, we process contact data as well as the correspondence with and billing details of our customers and prospective customers.
This data is collected via email and through the contact form on our website.

==========
What is the legal basis for processing your information and under which terms do we cooperate with our partners?
The Semasio User Intelligence Platform operates on the basis of legitimate interest of providing services relating to online advertising, art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
As a responsible company, Semasio also informs cooperation partners of the relevant data protection regulation, and has detailed contractual agreements with them.
Specific business terms assure that data protection regulations are understood, openly communicated and followed.
However, cooperation partners are themselves responsible for adhering to the applicable data protection requirements and usually have their own privacy policies.
Semasio therefore does not take any responsibility and/or liability for this.
For customer data, the legal basis is entering into and carrying out a contract with our customers, art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
The use of Google Analytics is based on the legitimate interest of obtaining visitor statistics for our website.
