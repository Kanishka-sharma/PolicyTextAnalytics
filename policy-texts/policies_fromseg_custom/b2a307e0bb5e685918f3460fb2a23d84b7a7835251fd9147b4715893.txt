Privacy Policy
Welcome to the Imaginova Corp. (“Imaginova”) Web properties, including the Web sites LiveScience.com, Space.com, Aviation.com, Newsarama.com, OrionTelescopes.com (Telescope.com), LiveScienceStore.com, StarryNightStore.com (StarryNight.com), SpaceNews.com and Imaginova.com (the "Site(s)"), all of which are owned and operated by Imaginova.
Imaginova has created this Privacy Policy in order to set forth the principles governing our information-gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Sites, including but not limited to such activities as the offering for sale of services and merchandise, as well as   forums, chat rooms, personal profile pages, product reviews, article commentary, blogs, RSS feeds, newsletters and eCommerce, among other offerings (the "Web Site Activities”).
Imaginova has a strong commitment to the privacy of our Sites' users.
==========
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Sites and not to information collected offline   or to information you may provide to any third-party sites to which one or more of our Sites may link, except as expressly provided herein.
Information We Collect
There are two kinds of information that Web sites can obtain about you: &#8220Anonymous Information” and “Personally Identifiable Information.”
&#8220Anonymous Information” consists of non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or domain, or information about your usage of one or more of our Sites that is used for administrative purposes only.
For example, an IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.
Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
We may collect our users' IP addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform particular services on our behalf.
We may also collect IP addresses as a security precaution when customers initiate orders through our Sites, because although IP addresses themselves are non-personally identifiable, they are linked to information about you that is personally identifiable.
We may also use the information linked to IP addresses to ban users who violate our Terms and Conditions of use.
==========
“Personally Identifiable Information” is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, street address, email address, telephone number or credit card number.
We collect such information when, for example, you enter a contest, subscribe to our email newsletter, participate in other interactive online activities such as forums, or order merchandise through one of our Sites.
When we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you, you will have the opportunity to “opt in” to receive email or other digital communications from us and/or our business partners.
If you have submitted your personal information to LiveScience.com, Space.com, Aviation.com or Newsarama.com, you may correct, amend or delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained on file about you if it is incorrect.
==========
Users may change or modify such information by sending us an email.
Click here to send us an email.
NOTE:  DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION IN ANY EMAIL COMMUNICATION.
IF YOU DO, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL REMAIN SECURE, AND WE THEREFORE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT.
==========
If you are a registered Community member of LiveScience.com, Space.com, Aviation.com or Newsarama.com, you may manage your membership information as well as your subscriptions.
Simply login to your community account and click on &#8220Account Options.”
Click on the tab marked &#8220Account&#8221 to manage your password and email address; click on the tab marked &#8220Subscriptions &#8221 to manage your newsletter subscriptions and Click on the tab, &#8220Profile&#8221 to edit your public profile.
==========
</p> 
		<p>In all cases, we will only use your information as permitted by law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.
Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
</p>
		
		<h3>Use of &#8220Cookies&#8221</h3>
		<p>Our Sites use &#8220cookies&#8221 - data that is transferred from our Sites to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes - to keep track of your shopping cart when you order merchandise through our Sites, and to make sure you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly.
==========
We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit one or more of our Sites.
Some of the advertisements appearing on the Sites are delivered by our third-party ad network, DoubleClick.
In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique &#8220cookie&#8221 in your browser&#39s cache, and may use Anonymous Information (including date/time of the banner ad displayed, the ad that was displayed and the IP address of the visitor) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you and to collect statistical information.
==========

		<h3>Disclosure of Information through Business Transfers</h3>
		<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information.
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

Please note that your email, like most, if not all, unencrypted Internet communications, may potentially be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us.
==========

While we strive to protect your personal information, Imaginova cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through this our Sites.
