Privacy Policy
LogMeIn, Inc. ("LogMeIn"), respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us.
Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself.
This policy describes how we collect and use your personal information when we need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information through our LogMeIn.com website (the “Website”) or our applications (“Apps”).
Information Collection
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, company name, email address, telephone number, postal or other physical address, birth date, gender, occupation, a credit card number (including expiration date) to process payment for products, Apps and/or services and such other information when needed to provide a service that you requested.
Certain of our products, Apps and services also store connection or session information such as time/date and length of collection, IP address, chat logs and technician information.
As you navigate through this Website and/or use our Apps, certain anonymous information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream).
Your internet browser automatically transmits some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer or mobile device is currently using; the date and time you access the Website and the pages that you access while at the Website.
==========
This information is used for internal/external marketing purposes, to analyze trends and to improve our Website, products, Apps and services.
Our Website may also collect anonymous information from your computer or mobile device through cookies and internet tags or web beacons.
You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this Website might not work without cookies.
==========
LogMeIn collects personal information when you elect to use our software on a free trial basis or purchase an App, subscription or an upgrade.
LogMeIn only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.
Choice/Opt-Out
You may elect to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information.
This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to opt out at the point of collection.
Opt-out is the means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personal information for the purposes covered by the opt-out choice.
==========
You may opt out at the point of collection when personal information is collected, or you may do so at any time by sending an email request to support@LogMeIn.com (please indicate "Opt Out" in the subject line) or by sending a written request to the address provided below.
In some cases, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in".
This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.
==========
