Google Analytics, Maps & AdSense
In order to analyse and optimise our website and our Dashboard, we make use of Google Analytics.
Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., which uses cookies (see V.) to provide information about website usage.

We also use Google Maps API, an interactive map service provided by Google Inc.
Information about the usage of our website is transferred to Google’s servers in the USA and is stored there.

I. Purpose of measurements performed by Meetrics:
Meetrics performs analyses for the purpose of determining the quality of advertising environments, on behalf of advertisers, media agencies, online marketers and website operators.
As a result, customers are provided with information about the following aspects:
the share of advertising materials that became visible as a percentage of all delivered advertising materials
whether advertising was displayed in environments that might be harmful to the brand
whether calls were generated by botnets or other fraudulent delivery situations
Meetrics Viewability measuring does not require any personal attributes.
Meetrics Viewability measuring is based solely on websites’ internal visibility properties.
II.
Technical basics
Meetrics uses a javascript that is integrated into an HTML document in the course of advertising delivery to analyse visits to a page.
As part of the analysis, aggregated evaluations are created based on individual visits, to provide information about the advertising positions used.
The evaluation objects in this context are advertising positions in individual sections of a page (on the most granular assessment level for example, information could be provided that out of 1,000 instances of advertising delivery within a campaign, 800 instances have become effectively visible in a particular advertising position of a domain).
==========
III.
Data collected
In order to be able to provide the full scope of our services, user interaction with the website and the advertising material may be saved.
For this purpose, data about the user’s operating system and browser will be collected.
Interaction with the website is also recorded in order to determine the visibility of advertising media and to distinguish human visitors to a website from automated calls.
In order to account for the environments in which advertising is placed, it is also verified whether specified keywords are present in advance.
We do not create profiles.
==========
User IP address
Meetrics saves IP addresses for a short time, in order to identify the geographical origin of the traffic.
Saving applies only to a hash value from the IP address and further attributes that do not enable Meetrics to draw conclusions concerning the IP address, as well as the country of origin of the traffic.
Furthermore, Meetrics is also tasked by customers to identify fraudulent advertising delivery and to present this as an aggregated result for each analysed advertising position.
==========
Storage time is extended to 7 days, only for IP addresses that show a suspect frequency of calls.
The unencrypted IP address is deleted immediately after the encryption process.
The aggregation of calculated performance key figures based on different aggregation criteria takes place based on campaign information and no personal attributes are used at any time.
==========
IV.
Meetrics Audience Verification
This service allows advertisers to determine the socio-demographic spread of users of an online access panel found in specific advertising positions.
For preparing this statistical analysis, Meetrics cooperates with online panel providers.
In the course of registering users for this type of panel on the panel operator’s website, users explicitly grant consent for personal data to be captured by the panel provider.
Furthermore, a cookie containing a pseudonymised user ID is placed by Meetrics following opt-in by the panel lists.
The content of the cookie is also transmitted if an accordingly marked user retrieves a file from the Meetrics server as part of a Meetrics Ad Attention Monitor script delivery.
This data is only provided to our customers in aggregated form.
Transmission of results based on individual panelists is excluded.
==========
V. Disclosure and duration of storage
Under no circumstances will personal data collected on the customers’ websites be sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties.
Aggregated data to assess the quality of advertising positions (e. g. advertising format x on domain y) is provided to Meetrics’ customers (protected by a password).
Meetrics uses a data centre in Germany to perform data processing and storage (https://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Datenschutz-FAQ).
Aggregated data may be saved for up to 5 years.
