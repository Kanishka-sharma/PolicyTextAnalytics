Privacy Policy

The Little League® Privacy Policy has been written to answer questions you might have about our information and privacy practices.
As a youth organization we are very concerned about privacy.
==========
Therefore, we have taken measures to tailor our content and offerings to help protect the privacy of players, parents/guardians, volunteers and coaches/managers.
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected on Little League International authored websites such as LittleLeague.org; LittleLeaguestore.net; videos.LittleLeague.org; LittleLeagueU.org; and other affiliated websites and our official pages on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram or other social media (the “Sites”) as well as information received from other sources such as charter enrollment and player registration data and volunteer data reporting.

Advice to Children and Parents

We strongly advise children to get their parent(s) or guardian(s) to review any information they intend to transmit and get their parents’ or guardians’ permission before submitting any kind of personal data to anyone over the Internet.
==========
We urge parents to repeatedly discuss with their children the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in person) whom they do not personally know.
We also encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children monitoring and reviewing their children’s online activity.
As a policy, no person under the age of 13 is permitted to register directly to receive Little League’s electronic communications or participate in Little League social media activities.
Such activity, if deemed appropriate, must be conducted by the parent or guardian of such individuals.

Cookies and Pixel Tags -- What are they?
Cookies and pixel tags are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies and pixel tags make Internet surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, preferences and preferred websites as you browse.
The use of cookies and pixel tags are an industry standard – you will find that they are used by most major websites.
By showing how and when visitors use the site, cookies and pixel tags can also help website developers see which areas are popular and which are not and can help you find information that is most relevant to you based on your search history.
==========
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether.
If you reject cookies, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or receive a promotion tailored to you.
==========
The Sites do not control and do not guarantee the effectiveness of browser-based tools for managing cookies.
Does the Little League website use cookies or pixel tags?
Yes.
==========
As you browse the Sites, cookies, pixel tags, or similar technology may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what information interests you on our site, in order to continue to provide information in the future.

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services.
At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, the Little League websites do not recognize DNT.
