Opting-Out of Interest-Based Advertising
As part of The Globe’s commitment to fair information practice, The Globe is a participant of the Digital Advertising Alliance Canada's (DAAC) AdChoices program and adheres to its principles.
The DAAC’s AdChoices initiative allows you to opt-out of the use of information for interest-based advertising.
==========
For more information on this program, see https://youradchoices.ca/
Web and Mobile Browser: At any time you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on your desktop or mobile browser by clicking on the “AdChoices” logo on the top right corner of our site.
An “Interest Based Advertising” screen will appear providing you with a link to the DAAC tool that generates a list of third-party advertising companies participating in the DAAC’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Interest-Based Advertising and who are currently collecting data from your browser for the purposes of targeted advertising.
You can also access the tool here
You may also see the AdChoices icon in or around advertisements on a website of The Globe.

You can opt out of targeted advertising from that advertiser by clicking the "AdChoices" logo within the ad.

DAAC also provides a tool called AppChoices to help you opt-out that can be downloaded here: https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools/ .
Important Notes About Your Opt-Outs:
If you opt-out of interest-based advertising by us or a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us across the Internet, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.
On web browsers, interest-based advertising opt-outs work by saving cookies in your browser that tells the various ad partners that you have opted-out.
For mobile devices, interest-based advertising opt-outs work by sending an opt out signal that tell the various ad partners that you have opted-out on a particular device.
You must opt out separately on each of your browsers and mobile devices from which you do not want to receive interest-based advertising to ensure that information collected on a particular browser or device is not used on another browser or device.
If you delete or clear your browser’s cookies, you will need to opt-out again.
For more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop, mobile browser or apps please visit the DAAC website: youradchoices.ca.
