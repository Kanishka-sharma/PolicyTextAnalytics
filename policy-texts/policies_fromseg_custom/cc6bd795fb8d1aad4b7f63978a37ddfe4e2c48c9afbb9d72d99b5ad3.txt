Rivals.com Additional Terms of Service
By becoming a Subscriber to Rivals' Premium Services, or by using this site (hereinafter the "Site"), which is a part of the Rivals Network, you agree to be bound by this additional terms of service.
Rivals is a Yahoo! Inc brand, by becoming a Subscriber to the Rivals' Premium Services or by using this Site, which is part of the Rivals Network, you also agree that you are subject to the Yahoo! Terms of Service located at http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
For clarity Rivals.com is a "Service" as defined in the Yahoo! Terms of Service.
This agreement is subject to change or updated by Rivals at any time without notice to you.
You can review the most current version of this Agreement at any time at http://www.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=47688.
==========
Payment Obligation and Credit Card Authorization
All subscription/membership fees are non-refundable.
The Subscriber is responsible for paying periodic subscription fees, and hereby authorizes Rivals to charge the subscriber's credit card, debit card, or bank account, to pay for the ongoing cost of subscriptions/membership fees via automatic debit.
Subscription plans, offerings and length of terms offered may vary by site.
Unless specifically stated, subscribers will be automatically renewed for a term equal to the original term upon expiration of the then-current term, and continually thereafter, unless the Subscriber terminates the subscription by phone at least 48 hours prior to the renewal date.
When termination is requested by a Subscriber, there is no refund for any unused portion of the current subscription.
==========
Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that the authorization to charge Subscriber's credit card for services shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of Service for substantially similar services at the same website.
Subscriber may not assign or transfer his or her subscription to any other person or entity.
Should Subscriber request a refund which is denied for a valid reason under these Terms of Service, and should Subscriber subsequently file a claim against Rivals, Rivals shall be entitled to collect from Subscriber all costs (including attorneys fees) associated with defending such a claim.
==========
To protect against potential fraud, Yahoo! may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us.
The verification process may include debiting an amount between $0.01 and $0.99 from your credit card account and then crediting the same amount back to your credit card or otherwise ceasing the transaction, and also may include asking you to verify the amount debited in order to confirm that you are in possession of your credit card.
Yahoo! will only use this process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the Service.
By providing Yahoo! with your credit card information, you authorize Yahoo! to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than one dollar for such verification purposes.
==========
Free Trial Memberships and Coupons
Some Rivals sites occasionally offer promotional free trial memberships to the Premium Ticket service.
Subscribers that sign up for a free trial membership will be automatically renewed at the normal subscription rate at the end of the trial period, unless the Subscriber cancels at least 48 hours before the end of the trial.
Only one free trial period is allowed per subscriber.
Subsequent subscriptions do not qualify for free trials.
Some Rivals sites may offer coupons or other promotional offers from time to time.
In these situations, a special discounted price may be applicable for a term, followed by a higher price after the initial promotional term.
By subscribing, you agree that you will be responsible for all payments as specified in the offer, and you agree that Rivals may adjust the pricing of such plans, as specified in the offer, promotional materials or coupon, without notice or other communication to you.
Some sites will occasionally piggyback other free offers with the free trial offer.
In this case, the user must actually complete the free trial and be charged one time before they are eligible to receive the additional free offer.
==========
Premium Ticket and
Special Edition
Many Rivals sites offer Premium Ticket subscription packages, while some offer Special Edition subscription packages.
Subscriptions to one type of package will not give the user access to the other.
All Premium Ticket packages are automatically renewed according to the term selected by the subscriber, while Special Edition packages are automatically renewed unless otherwise specifically stated.
A Special Edition subscription does not grant access to ALL Special Edition content on the network.
Each such package specifies what content is included.
Message Boards
Subscriber-only message boards are included in many Premium Ticket subscriptions.
==========
The accepted standards of conduct in these communities, as well as our other message board communities, are determined by the publishing partner of any given site.
Subscribers and registered users agree that Rivals and its publishing partners have the right to enforce these standards, including deletion of posts, blacklisting/banning users, or removing access to premium message boards with no refund to the Subscriber.
By subscribing, registering or using the sites, you agree that Rivals and or the publisher(s) and board moderators of the sites have the right, in addition to other rights, to delete your posts or blacklist you or any other user at any time, if they believe that action is in the best interest of the sites, for whatever reason, and the reason need not be disclosed.
==========
Subscriber Information
Subscriber must promptly inform Rivals of any of the following: changes in the expiration date of any credit card used in connection with the service; changes in home or billing address; and apparent breaches of security, such as loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of an ID or password.
Until Rivals is notified by e-mail of a breach in security, the Subscriber will remain liable for any unauthorized use of the Premium Ticket Service.
Access
Subscribers are responsible for providing all personal computer and communications equipment necessary to gain access to the Service.
Access to and use of the Premium Ticket Service is through a combination of an ID and a password.
Each Subscriber must keep his password strictly confidential.
