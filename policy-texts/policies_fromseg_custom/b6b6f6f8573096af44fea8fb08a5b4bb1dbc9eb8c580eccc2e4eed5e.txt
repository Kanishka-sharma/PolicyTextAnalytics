At no time do we share your email address with our partners.
==========
Bigstock may collect information about the use of the Site, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily.
This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually.

Your choices with respect to personal information
  Bigstock recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Site.

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.
Protection of your personal information
  The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a Bigstock Member, Bigstock Contributor or user of any of the services on our Site is, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, classified as Registration Information.
==========
Registration Information is protected in several ways.
Access by you to yourRegistration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you.
This password is encrypted during transmission.
You should not divulge your password to anyone.
In addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected Bigstock personnel and contractors have access to via password.
Bigstock encrypts your personal information during transmission and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to Bigstock.
==========
The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We strive to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
==========
If you have any questions about security on our Web Site, you can send email to us on our Contact Us page.
Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on a secure server and is accessible only to selected Bigstock personnel and contractors via password.
Since this information is not accessible by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.
==========
Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board or chat room, such as the Forum For Contributors (the "Forums"), is available to all persons accessing that location.
Your e-mail address will not automatically be posted on the Forums unless you modify the default setting to permit that.
