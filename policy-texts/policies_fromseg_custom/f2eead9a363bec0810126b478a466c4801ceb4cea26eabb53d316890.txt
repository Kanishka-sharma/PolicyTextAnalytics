California residents have certain rights with respect to Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
For purposes of this subsection, the terms consumer, categories of personal information, business purpose, third party, and sell have the meanings ascribed to them respectively in the CCPA.
Terms defined under the CCPA may differ in meaning from the common usage of the same terms used elsewhere in this Notice.

We may extend this time period to provide once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary.
We will provide notice of the extension within the first 45-day period.

Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you.
Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
None of the foregoing, however, prohibits Citi from charging you a different price or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to Citi by your data.

E. Verification.
Whether you submit a request directly on your own behalf, or through an authorized agent, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your requests under CCPA.
