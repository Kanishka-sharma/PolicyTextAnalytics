(in the remainder referred to as Haensel AMS)
Last updated 6th of Septembr 2018.
Haensel AMS is registered and headquartered in Germany (GmbH) and USA (Inc).
Of course, we comply with the legal provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the German Teleservices Act (TMG) and other data protection provisions.
For Haensel AMS the protection of personal data very serious and we strictly comply with the data privacy laws.
Data collected for web tracking
When you visit our website or websites of our clients, who use Hansel AMS as a first party tracking solution, and when you gave consent to the tracking, usually by actively clicking to agree in the data collection disclaimer on the websites, certain information is transmitted by your browser and collected by us.
The data is collected in the Amazon WebService (AWS) cloud, server locations are in the EU (Dublin or Frankfurt).
Further the data is collected on separate AWS accounts for the different websites and clients.
Data of different clients is always strictly separated.
Usually the AWS account is registered by each client and belongs to them, generally we are only user in the accounts.
The data is collected to perform data analysis on the customer journeys, mainly to understand: how visitors experience and use the websites and how effective certain marketing activities and customer interactions are.
==========
Data collection is carried out through a pixel which is integrated on each page.
All tracking solution clients are instructed to execute the tracking only after the website visitor gave consent to the data collection.
Since we do not have full control over our clients’ websites, we cannot enforce this on our own.
Haensel AMS does not pass any data on to third parties, who do not have the explicit data collection consent from the individual person.
Technical and Organizational Measures to ensure the data protection
Physical access control:
Unauthorized persons have no access to the business premises of Haensel AMS.
==========
Access is only possible with keys or access codes.
Access to the data on the cloud account:
Only the dedicated employees responsible for the specific client project have access to the AWS account of our clients.
Login to separate AWS accounts is via Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), i.e. personal password and smartphone authenticator app.
PEM files are used for the SSH connections to AWS Server, if they are stored on laptops, these are overnight in a safe, and which have encrypted hard drives.
AWS logins from each user are logged.
==========
Order Control:
No subcontractors will be charged with the collection, processing or use of personal data.
Transfer and input control:
AWS logins and activities from each user are saved with times.
All client data remains strictly on the AWS account designated.
Availability Control:
Haensel AMS implemented periodical backups to ensure high availability of the systems and the data.
Separation control:
The data remains on the separate AWS account for the client, only for specific data analysis tasks employees of Haensel AMS may temporarily download data samples to perform the work on their local machines.
Only the event tracking data is stored at the AWS account available to Haensel AMS.
No other data sources with potential customer specific data are there available.

The following data is collected

Browser type/ version (e.g. Internet Explorer 11)
Browser language (e.g. English)
Screen resolution

Information on viewed products and general order details such as products and amount (if applicable)
An IP Address is sent with every server call, in order that the server knows where to send the response.
An IP Address is allocated to everyone when they connect to the internet.
This IP Address is assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
The ISP can determine which IP Address was allocated to which customer at which point in time.
==========
With the law concerning data storage, the ISP is required to store this information.
It is possible via the ISP to identify the person responsible for the user’s internet connection.
Therefore, we do not save the full IP Address.
We anonymize the IP Address by shortening and hashing it immediately before storing the data.
It is not possible to link any individual person with that IP data or to identify any individual person with it.
==========
For geographical analysis, we try to lookup the country, region and city of an IP address (right before it is hashed) in a database of various ISPs with the geographic location of some IP addresses included down to the city level.
The individual address, lower than city level, of the Internet user is always unknown to us.
The IP addresses are never permanently written to disk in their original form.
