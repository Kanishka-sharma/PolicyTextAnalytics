This government computer system uses industry-standard software 
            to create summary statistics, which are used for such things as assessing 
            what information is of most and least interest, determining technical 
            design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem 
            areas.

If you have any questions or comments about the information presented 
            here, please forward them to us through the address on our Comments 
            Page.
Below is an example of the information collected based on a standard 
				request for a World Wide Web document: 

 xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12) -- this is the host 
					name (or IP address) associated with the requester (you as 
					the visitor).
In this case, (....com) the requester is coming 
					from a commercial address.
==========
Depending on the requestor's method 
					of network connection, the host name (or IP address) may or 
					may not identify a specific computer.
Connections via many 
					Internet Service Providers assign different IP addresses for 
					each session, so the host name identifies only the ISP.
The 
					host name (or IP address) will identify a specific computer 
					if that computer has a fixed IP address.
[28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] -- this is the date and 
					time of the request 
 "GET /sitename/news/nr012797.
html HTTP/1.0" -- this 
					is the location of the requested file 
  200 -- this is the status code - 200 is OK - the request 
					was filled 
 16704 -- this is the size of the requested file in 
					bytes 
 Mozilla 3.0 -- this identifies the type of browser 
					software used to access the page, which indicates what design 
					parameters to use in constructing the pages 
 www.websitename.com -- this indicates the last site 
					the person visited, which indicates how people find this site 
				

 Requests for other types of documents use similar information.
No other user-identifying information is collected.
