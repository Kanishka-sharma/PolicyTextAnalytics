==========
What personal information does EMC process?
Personal Information is information that identifies or can identify a specific individual.
EMC may collect information about individuals such as their name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.
==========
EMC may collect certain personal information from customers, business partners, employees and candidates for employment.
EMC does not collect personal information when you visit EMC's web sites unless you choose to provide it to EMC.
Customers and Business Partners — On EMC web sites you can order products or services, register products, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register to a secure extranet site to obtain access to product information, support, services, and training.
EMC will collect personal information from you for these purposes.
The types of information you provide to EMC on these pages may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card or other financial information, and contact preferences.
==========
Employees and Applicants — EMC also collects personal information from its employees and applicants (human resources data) in connection with its recruiting and hiring activities and administration of its human resources programs and functions.
Current EMC employees can go on-line to access their individual employee profiles, job-related data, compensation and benefit information, to make benefit elections and transactions and to make changes to their personal information.
==========
How does EMC use customer and business partner personal information?
EMC will use personal information to provide customers and business partners with information and services and to help us better understand your needs and interests.
Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to deliver products/services to you, to bill you for products/services you purchased, and to provide ongoing service and support.
Occasionally we may use your information to contact you to complete surveys that we use for marketing and quality assurance purposes.
==========
Personal information collected online may be combined with information you provide to EMC through other sources such as trade shows or seminars.
We may also use it to contact you by electronic or other means such as telephone or mail, to tell you about products and services of EMC or its subsidiaries and divisions, or, if we think this may interest you, of other parties.
EMC may share the personal information that you have submitted to EMC with third parties in responding to your requests for products or services or product evaluations.
==========
Also, we may on occasion share information to allow selected partners to send you special offers in blind mailings.
If your information is sourced from within the EU, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information used and/or shared for marketing purposes, or we will obtain your prior agreement to this as applicable under relevant laws.
However, if you request information on any of our products/services, EMC may provide your information to third party distributors and resellers who may subsequently contact you directly regarding such products/services.
In these instances, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of having your information shared with these third party distributors and resellers, as the transfer of data is necessary to provide the products or services you requested.
==========
Some of EMC's websites make on-line newsgroups, chat forums and blogs available to our users.
Any information that is disclosed in these forums becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
==========
EMC may, from time to time, send e-mail (in accordance with applicable laws) regarding our products and services to users who have posted to our newsgroups.
Each participant's opinion expressed in a newsgroup is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of EMC.
==========
Some EMC websites also provide for "Live Chat" wherein EMC personnel can monitor the user's areas of interest in the web site and engage in instant messaging with the user to provide additional information or answer any questions.
By posting in our newsgroups and using "Live Chat" you expressly consent to these uses of your information.
==========
Should we undergo any sort of corporate reorganization in the future, we may need to provide your information to the resulting entity.
We may also provide it to law enforcement agencies if they request it or if we feel this is necessary to protect our business, employers, suppliers or customers.
We will only do this once we are satisfied it is appropriate to do so.
==========
