On May 25, 2018, a data privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, impacting how businesses collect and process data from individuals in the European Union.This meant new rules to follow when it comes to collecting, tracking, or handling EU-based prospects’ and customers’ personal data.
If you have or plan to have website/app visitors who are in the EU, or you process any form of EU data, this one’s for you.
