You can visit www.apple.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
While IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session, the user remains anonymous.
Tracking IP addresses gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there.
We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
This means that a user's session is tracked, but the user is anonymous.
The user's browser also lets us know the type of computer and operating system being used.

If, however, you want to purchase a product from the Apple Store, register a new product, sign up for a mailing list, enter a sweepstakes or sign onto a page that requires authorization, you'll be asked to provide us your name, e-mail address, postal address, and possibly other personal information.
Some Apple web pages utilize "cookies," which are small files with your personal information placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
==========
A cookie helps Apple remember who you are, and what questions you've already answered.
It makes your subsequent visits to the web page simpler and more seamless for you.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
(For some web pages which require authorization, cookies are not optional.
Users choosing not to accept cookies will likely not be able to access those pages.)
==========
When Apple receives information about your session or about you, we may use it for research or to improve our site and the services we offer you.
We ask you if you want us to use that information to continue contact with you via e-mail or postal mail -- for example, to send you information or special offers.
We also ask you if you want us to share your personal information with other companies that offer related services.
If you do not want us or other companies to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and Apple will respect your wishes.
