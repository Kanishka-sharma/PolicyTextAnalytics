This Privacy Policy is designed to describe how we approach your privacy as an Internet user interacting with websites that have implemented our advertising technology.

GENERAL INFORMATION
We are an advertising technology company that provides online advertisement services to advertisers (e.g., e-shops) in the programmatic advertising environment.
Our role is to give advertisers an effective tool to display ads of their products or services on publishers’ websites and mobile applications you visit (e.g., news portals).
Our ads are personalized, i.e., based on the information on your previous online activity.
We will display to you the ads of those advertisers whose websites or apps you had visited in the past (a service known as retargeting) or ads that we believe otherwise match your current shopping interests.
In order to serve personalized ads, we process certain information related to your online activity that helps us understand what your current shopping interests might be and allows us to display an ad and analyze how it performs.
==========
While doing so, we aim at ensuring the highest level of privacy protection and transparency.
We strictly comply with all applicable privacy laws, in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (E-Privacy Directive), as well as established best practices on the digital advertising market.

HOW DO WE COLLECT YOUR DATA
In order to collect your data, we use cookies, which are text files inserted in your web browser when you visit advertisers’ or publishers’ websites or apps, as well as other tracking technologies available on your device, such as mobile advertising ID.
They allow us to register certain activities you perform on those websites or apps.
We operate under the creativecdn.com domain while providing our services.
We store two cookies under this domain: (a) “u” which contains unique ID established for the browser you use (b) “ts” which stores the timestamp needed to establish cookie lifetime.
3.
==========
WHAT DATA WE PROCESS
We process the following three main groups of data:
(a)       Information related to your browsing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps — it helps us understand what sorts of products and services you are interested in and, consequently, determine which ads should be displayed to you to match your current shopping interests.
We process this data on behalf of the advertisers for whom we conduct advertising campaigns (as a data processor), specifically for the purpose of creating your user profile.
(b)      Information that you are currently entering a publisher’s website or app, where we may display an ad to you — it comes within a so called bid request, which is an offer to buy an advertising space on the publisher’s website or app in order to display an ad (for details, see Section 4 below).
We process this information as a data controller for the purposes of displaying ads, ad measurement, brand safety, product development, and fraud detection.
(c)       Information regarding the delivery of our ads, i.e., impressions of an ad (e.g., whether we displayed an ad to you and, if so, which ad we selected) and your interactions with an ad (e.g., whether you clicked on it).
We process this information as a data controller for the purposes of displaying ads (in particular for frequency capping and ad rotation), ad measurement, and product development.
You may find a full list of categories of data we process as a data controller in our GDPR privacy notice (see Section 5 below).
==========
While providing our services, we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, or financial data, such as credit card details.
We do not receive any additional data from advertisers or partners, which, along with the data collected by our technology, would enable us to directly identify you.

==========
HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
While you are visiting an advertiser’s website or app (e.g., an e-shop), we collect certain information related to your activity there, such as which items you viewed, put in the basket, and bought.
Those browsing patterns on the advertiser’s website or app help us understand what sorts of products and services you are currently interested in and thus display to you, on publishers’ digital properties (e.g., news portals), only ads compatible with these interests.
We display our personalized ads with the use of a programmatic instantaneous auction system known as real-time bidding (RTB).
Real-time bidding procedure happens at the moment you enter a publisher’s website or app that offers an advertising space for sale.
While such website is loading, a bid request is sent to us by the publisher or our business partner cooperating with the publisher (e.g., supply-side platform, SSP) inviting us to buy a certain ad space.
After receiving such bid request, our technology uses information about your previous browsing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps to decide whether to buy the auctioned ad space and, if so, which ad to display.
==========
For instance, if you had recently visited our client’s e-shop looking for running shoes, we may display to you an ad of those same running shoes you had viewed there and similar running shoes or complementary products, such as running clothes offered by that advertiser.
We may also use information on the content of the website where the ad is to be displayed for the additional personalization of this particular ad.
However, we never use such website content to personalize future ads, in particular we do not assign this information to your user profile in order to categorize you (e.g., by assigning you to a particular population segment) or try to determine your shopping interests on the basis of your browsing history on publishers’ websites or apps.
Moreover, we do not use your browsing data across advertisers, which means that a browsing activity from one advertiser’s website or app does not affect other advertisers’ ads we display.
For instance, the fact that you looked for swimming equipment in an e-shop of our client “A” will not result in us displaying you swimming equipment from an e-shop of our client “B” (unless you had previously browsed similar products on “B” e-shop as well).
==========
After we display an ad to you, we collect information regarding ad impressions (e.g., that we indeed displayed an ad to you, which ad was selected, and when and on what type of device it was displayed) and your interactions with the ad (mainly whether you clicked on it or not).
We use this information for the analysis of how our ads perform, for the creation of statistical reports for advertisers regarding the delivery of their ads, and subsequently for attribution and billing purposes.
We also process this data for the control of the frequency of ads we display to you (frequency capping) and for product development purposes.
==========
Our platform is integrated with the RTB environment through matching of our technical identifiers, e.g., cookie IDs or mobile advertising IDs (“cookie matching”) with those used by our business partners.
It enables us to (a) receive a bid request and eventually serve an ad on a publisher’s website or app that uses our business partners’ digital advertising technology and (b) collect information related to our ad serving activities.
Upon an advertiser’s specific request and on the basis of the information provided by such advertiser, we may perform cross-device tracking that consists of displaying the same categories of ads of this particular advertiser’s products or services on different devices you use (e.g. laptops and smartphones).
We do not, however, perform specific data analyses in order to link the devices you use on the basis of the patterns of your online behavior (i.e., we do not conduct probabilistic cross-device tracking).
==========
We also use your personal data for the detection of frauds and other potential dangers to privacy security, for the calculation of the usage levels of our technology, and for brand safety purposes, i.e., to analyze whether publishers’ websites are a suitable environment for our ads to be displayed and to develop and improve our products.
We do not purchase any third-party data from data providers for service optimization purposes or sell data we process to any third parties.
Advertisers and publishers whose websites or apps you visit may independently collect and use your data for different purposes.
Please consult their privacy policies for more information in this regard.

Consequently, in cases where the GDPR applies to our services, we assure compliance with all the requirements established by this regulation.
