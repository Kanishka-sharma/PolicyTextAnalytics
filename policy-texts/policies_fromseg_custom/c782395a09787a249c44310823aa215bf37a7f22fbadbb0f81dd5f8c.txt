Interim Privacy Policy Notice

ORACLE is working to assure that the private nature of individually 
identifiable information provided to or collected by Oracle is appropriately 
maintained.
Oracle wants to assure that visitors and users of Oracle web sites 
are provided with appropriate information and choice mechanisms to make and 
implement informed decisions on providing personally identifiable information.
Oracle, a founding member of the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA, 
http://www.privacyalliance.org), is in the 
process of implementing the 
OPA 
principles.
Oracle will update this site with a complete corporate privacy policy once  
interdepartmental surveys are complete and the procedures are implemented.
In 
the interim, if you would like to find out more information on what Oracle is 
doing to develop its privacy policy, or if you would like to provide comments,
