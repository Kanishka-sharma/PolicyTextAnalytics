Remove your name from Facebook social ads
You may have your friends in groups on Facebook so that when you share a piece of information you can pick which group(s) will see it.
For instance, you may post about a personal accomplishment that is more relevant to your family than your co-workers or old classmates, so there's no need to share with everyone.
Basically, tailored share settings on Facebook are great if you only want to divulge some of your personal details to specific people.

Unfortunately, the Facebook social ads can easily draw attention to details about your personal preferences to everyone who has you … Read more
Password-protect e-mail on your iPhone and iPad
After last week's post describing two apps that keep your iPhone and iPad data private, a reader posed this question:
Is there any app that allows you to use it like the 'mail' app on an iPhone etc., but has a password lock facility?

I'm sure Apple had a reason for not allowing iPhone and iPad users to require a passcode to access the device's mail app, but I don't know what that reason was.

I came up with a free workaround that requires creation of a send-only … Read more
How to outfox Web sites trying to get you to pay top dollar
So, Orbitz has spilled the beans, well some of them, and says it in essence up-sells to people based on which browser they use.
The site told The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) that it discovered that Mac users tend to pay as much as 30 percent more for hotel rooms.
(Well, they are paying a premium for the computer too so it's not that surprising, although $20 to $30 more is significant.)
Leveraging that information, Orbitz decided to experiment with displaying pricier hotels in search results to Mac users than to Windows users.

How to browse sensitive subjects without being tracked
A reader commenting on a Q&A about the rise in behavioral tracking for targeted advertising asked a great question: How does one browse sensitive subjects without being tracked via cookies?
For most Web activities, many people won't be bothered that they are served up ads for cars or even acne cream if they have been reading news about the newest Tesla or visiting dermatology Web sites.
But what about when someone is researching a hereditary or embarrassing medical condition that one would not want revealed to advertisers, shoulder surfers or, worse yet, insurance companies?

Remove your social media from Google search
Many social media sites offer options to help protect your privacy on the Web.
You can make your profile private, which won't allow anyone you haven't approved to see your information, or you can remove your name from the account and use a different nickname that only friends would look for.
==========
However, these changes will only affect your content moving forward, not the stuff you've posted in the past.
So if you're just seeking a quick fix to get your personal thoughts and pictures of past and present out of the results, this is how you … Read more

Limit your participation in Facebook social ads
What makes Facebook worth $100 billion?
(Likely somewhat less, as Suzanne Vranica and Shayndi Raice explain in The Wall Street Journal.)
==========
Topping the list is the revenue-generating potential of the company's upcoming Premium ads and other new advertising programs.
Facebook, Google, and just about every other big-name Web service make their money by selling ads that get targeted based on what they know about you.
==========
The companies say they don't sell personally identifiable information to third parties, but one way or another, information about their users is the services' bread and butter.

How to automatically log out of Facebook
