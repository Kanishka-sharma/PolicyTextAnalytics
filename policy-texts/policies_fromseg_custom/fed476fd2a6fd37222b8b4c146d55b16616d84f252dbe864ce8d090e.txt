Advertiser Terms and Conditions
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
In addition to being bound by the Terms as described above for Site users, as an Advertiser on our Site, you are also agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions for ELOCAL Advertisers ("Advertising Agreement").
TERM.
The term of this Advertising Agreement commences on the date your ads are placed live on our Site.
For premium paid advertisers, the specifics of your advertising package such as coverage area, ad types and monthly billing are confirmed in an email sent to you or your representative ("Advertising Program" or "Advertising").
==========
This email will supersede any oral understandings or commitments.
Your Advertising Program will automatically renew until cancelled by you in writing.
We do not offer any refunds or proration.
==========
For Free Advertisers, you will be provided with one free listing in your primary zip code.
CANCELLATION.
Your Advertising Program may be cancelled at any time by Notice as per this Advertising Agreement.
Upon cancellation, your advertising will remain on the Site until the end of the period for which you have most recently paid.
ELOCAL also reserves the right to cancel your Advertising Program at any time.
Any breach of this Advertising Agreement will also result in immediate cancellation and removal from the Site with no refund or proration.
Upon cancellation, your account will lose any associated placement seniority.
Free Advertisers can request to be removed from the Site at any time by using our contact us form.
==========
TYPES OF PAID ACCOUNTS AND BILLING.
We offer two types of paid advertising plans: (i) Monthly Subscription Fee Plan; and (ii) Pay for Performance Plan.
For Monthly Subscription Fee Plan ("Fixed Fee"), advertisers pay a fixed monthly amount for their advertising program without regard to the quality or quantity of the advertising results.
Fixed Fee accounts are automatically renewed monthly on the account anniversary date.
For Pay for Performance Plan ("PFP"), advertisers establish a budget which is then depleted based on activity (i.e., phone calls, leads and website clicks).
PFP accounts are only charged for "valid" calls.
A call is valid when a consumer is inquiring about your services or when a local caller reaches an answering machine and chooses NOT to leave a message.
Solicitations, wrong numbers, and repeat calls from the same caller within a 30 day time period constitute "Invalid" calls.
==========
Once a PFP budget is depleted, the advertiser's credit card will automatically be charged to replenish the budget.
Your Advertising Program will automatically renew until cancelled by you in writing.
We do not offer any refunds or proration.
==========
ELOCAL reserves the right to increase our advertising rates at any time.
Upon such notification, your billing will increase to the new rates for your next billing cycle.
If we attempt to bill your credit card and it is declined or we are unable to process payment for any reason, we reserve the right to cancel your account.
Upon cancellation, your account will lose any associated placement seniority.
==========
You will be liable for all charges to your credit card for your Advertising Program unless you have proof of cancellation.
You agree to contact us immediately to the extent charges from us continue to hit your credit card statement after you believe you requested cancellation.
If you continue to accept charges from us for more than one credit card cycle without notifying us then that will indicate your continued acceptance of our advertising services.
To the extent you attempt to dispute our charges after accepting our advertising services, you agree to pay any attorneys' fees and costs that our agents or we incur in subsequently collecting the disputed amounts.
You will pay any sales, use or other local, state, federal, foreign or other taxes or governmental fees arising out of or in connection with this Advertising Agreement, other than taxes based on our net income.
==========

We use this wording for promotional purposes only and will determine, at our sole discretion, if the advertising will continue to be sold to only one business.

The purpose of our providing your business listing to Distribution Sites is generally to provide additional exposure for your business.
ASSIGNMENT OF CALL TRACKING NUMBERS ("CTN").
You understand and agree that we may assign an individual CTN to your business listing either on our Site or on the listings provided to Distribution Sites.
CTNs may be assigned to your business in order to better track calls received by you as a result of our efforts.
You also consent to the fact that calls received through the CTN may be recorded by us.
Such recordings may or may not be preceded by a notification that the call is being recorded.
However, we do not record calls where there is an expectation of client privilege (e.g., attorney-client privilege).
