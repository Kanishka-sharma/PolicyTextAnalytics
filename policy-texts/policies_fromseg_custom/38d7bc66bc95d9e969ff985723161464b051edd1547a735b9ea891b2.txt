About RxList
Frequently Asked Questions:
Q.  Why does your RxList search 
                    find drug names I was not looking for?
A.
The search uses 'fuzzy' logic 
                    and attempts to match patterns similar to your input assuming 
                    you may not know how to spell the drug name you're searching 
                    for.
If you are certain of your spelling, an asterisk (*) 
                    placed in the search string (such as prozac*) will turn off 
                    the fuzzy logic feature and the search will perform exact 
                    pattern matches only.

                    of the time.

Q.  Can I purchase my prescriptions 
                    from RxList?
A.  RxList is not a licensed 
                    pharmacy.
Our Webrx.com 
                    Pharmacy , however, maintains the necessary licenses to 
                    ship to all 50 states (Michigan pending) and offers, in addition

                    Health and beauty aids, Natural products, and competitive 
                    pricing.
Q.  I e-mailed a question to 
                    info@rxlist.com and received an auto-reply that said your 
                    policy is to not answer questions.
Why is that?
A.  RxList is run by a very small 
                    staff who keep pretty busy maintaining the site leaving little 
                    time to research your questions.
