PRIVACY POLICY

Effective May 31, 2003

N.Y.P. Holdings, Inc., which includes New York Post, NYPOST.COM, NYPOSTSTORE.COM, and STORE.NYPOST.COM, is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies.
N.Y.P. Holdings, Inc. has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. 

From time to time N.Y.P. Holdings, Inc. (the "Post") may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology, industry initiatives, , the features of Post web sites or off-line data collection practices.
Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.
COLLECTION:  COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY THE POST.
GENERAL.
==========
The  Post collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you.
When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, comments, content or suggestions you submit to us, bulletin boards, polls, e-mailing a friend, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information.
On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.
COOKIES.
Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet sites operated by the Post place on the hard drive of your computer.
Cookies remember information about your activities on our site(s) and enable the Post to make your visits to our site(s) more enjoyable.
For example, cookies can store your name and password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can keep track of whether or not you have voted in an online poll, can save your preferences for a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online store.
Other than as described above, the cookie does not contain PII.
==========
Third party advertisements displayed on Internet site(s) operated by the Post may also contain cookies.
The Post does not control these advertiser cookies and visitors to our web site(s) should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.
On occasion, the Post may use cookies to relate your use of our web site(s) to PII you have submitted to us.
For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie information may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we know you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
However, if the Post wishes to coordinate personal and cookie information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior consent (i.e., "opt in").
You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, without cookies you won't have access to certain features on the Post's web site(s), such as our email newsletter, voting in polls, shopping in the online store, purchasing home delivery or PDF versions of the New York Post.
==========
NOTICE:  THE POST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When the Post collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information.
This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your personal information (See "Use" below).
However, at the time your PII is collected, the Post will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below).
Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card, in-paper contest, or subscription form.
Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.
==========
The Post's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.
Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a NYPOST.COM logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by the Post (for example, our MarketWatch section is operated and maintained by Thomson Investors Network).
The Post's web site(s) also carry advertisements from other companies.
Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, the Post is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or so-called national advertisers.
==========
Once you've left a Post site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.
The Post's web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with the Post.
Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.
==========
Some of the advertisements that appear on the Post site are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies such as DoubleClick, Avenue A and 24/7 Real Media.
Our sites also use the services of Engage to deliver ads, promotions and other marketing messages .
These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to the Post site(s), including information about the banner ads they display, their cookie and your IP address.
To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit their websites at:

CHOICE:   THE POST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

The Post will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether the PII the Post collects from you may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted.
==========
You will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with the Post (i.e., not part of the News America Group).
USE:  THE POST'S USE OF PII

The Post will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed at the time of collection and you allow us to use your information in these other ways.
The Post may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is part of the News America Group of companies.
The Post may also share your PII with companies that are not part of the News America Group of companies, but would like to send you information about their products and services.
For example, we may offer promotions, contests, or sweepstakes in conjunction with a business partner with whom we may share your PII.
When we do this, there will also be a link to the partner's privacy policy.
However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties.
==========
Post employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII.
Outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide the Post with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
If the Post obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy.
The Post may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites.
SECURITY: THE POST PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

The Post uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.
In addition, the Post uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
