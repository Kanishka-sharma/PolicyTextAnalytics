Ogury Limited (“Ogury”, “we” or “us”) cares about its users’ privacy and is committed to clearly describing and disclosing its data practices.
Welcome to Ogury
Ogury is a mobile advertising technology company.
We develop and maintain software code that mobile app publishers and developers ("Publishers") integrate into their apps ("Partner Apps") to show ads.
Ogury’s suite of solutions for Publishers include Active Insights and Augmented Monetization – in this Privacy Statement, we call these solutions the “Ogury Product”.
Once the Ogury Product has been integrated into a Partner App, after receiving user consent, Ogury collects certain data ("User Data") relating to the user of the tablet, mobile or handheld device (“Device”) on which the Partner App is installed.
The User Data we collect is described in this Privacy Statement (see the heading "What is User Data?")
, and we only collect User Data with consent from the relevant Device user.
Your consent applies across to all Apps you have installed (or may in future install) that contain Ogury’s technology.
==========
This Privacy Statement explains how Ogury collects, stores, uses, and shares User Data (including personal information) from users who have installed Partner Apps on their Devices.
What is User Data?
Through the Ogury Product integrated into Partner Apps, Ogury collects User Data, however, we do this only where Users have consented to this collection.
The User Data we collect comprises the following categories of information:
Usage Data
We collect data about how Users use their Devices, together with the applications and systems on those Devices – this information includes:
What websites Users have bookmarked in their mobile browser.
Which websites Users have visited.
What applications are installed on the Users’ Device.
Users’ usage levels of these applications.
==========
The Usage Data collected by the Ogury Product is not limited to Usage Data that directly relates to the Partner App in which the Ogury Product is integrated.
Rather, the Ogury Product collects Usage Data from all applications and systems on the Device on which a Partner App is installed.
Technical Information
We collect technical Information relating to Users' Devices, that includes:
The type of Device being used (including manufacturer and model).
The version number of the Ogury Product used by the Partner App.
A User’s network status (limited to connection type; gsm, 3G, 4G/wifi etc).
Identifiers
Ogury links the Usage Data and Technical Information it collects listed above to certain device and user identifiers it collects from Users and their Devices, which include:
The User's email address & other mobile advertising identifiers on the Device (Ogury collects this information only where a User’s Device allows it through the Publisher Apps in order to derive insights such as gender and then we delete or anonymize the email addresses after 3 days).
Google Advertising ID.
IP Address.
==========
All User Data we collect is associated with these Identifiers.
Ad engagement information
To enable Ogury and its Partners to provide more personalized Ogury ads to Users (as described in the "How is User Data used?"
section below) and to report ad engagement metrics back to our Partners, we collect information on how Users engage with Ogury ads that are displayed to them, including:
What each Ogury Ad is about.
The format of each Ogury Ad (e.g., text, image, or video).
Where the Ogury Ad is displayed within the Partner App.
User interaction with the Ad (for example, clicks and how long the Ad was displayed for).
In addition, we combine this Ad Engagement Information with Usage Data collected about Users to determine what Users do when interacting with or after viewing each Ogury Ad – for example, to identify whether a User proceeded to buy the product or services that were displayed to them in an Ogury Ad.
Crash reporting information
To enable Ogury and its Partners to help to improve the Ogury Product and resolve technical problems, we collect information in cases where the Partner App has crashed, including: date and time of the crash, Google Advertising ID, API key, app package name and version, phone model, phone android version and a crash message.
==========
Other information
User Data includes any other information (including personal data) that may be submitted to us directly (for example, through a User submitted form).
Our policy towards children
In accordance with applicable European Union guidance on the practice, we do not knowingly collect User Data from children or use any User Data to target adverts to children.
Accordingly, we do not collect or use User Data to target Ogury ads to children under 16 years old.
If you believe we have inadvertently collected User Data from or about a child, please contact us using the details provided under the heading "Contact Us" below.
How is User Data used?
In simple terms – User Data is used by Ogury, advertisers and advertising agencies and Publishers (together “Partners”) to select and serve to Users adverts for products and services they actually want to see based on how they use their Device.
==========
Adverts of this nature are commonly referred to as “interest-based advertisements” or “behavioral advertising”.
For more information on interest-based advertising, how it works, and information on choices about how Users can interact with it, Users can go to http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/.
This is a helpful guide made available by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance a cross-industry coalition of European-level associations with an interest in delivering a responsible European Self-Regulatory Programme for Online Behavioural Advertising, which benefits internet users with greater transparency, choice, and control.
==========
Collecting User Data also allows us to effectively cap the number of times that Users see an Ogury Ad, so they do not see the same one too many times or too frequently.
We may also use User Data to create aggregated compilations of Users which are “de­identified” for the purposes of reporting to Partners; in a manner which prevents that User Data from being associated with, or capable of being associated with, any particular Device, Partner or Partner App (“Aggregated Data”).
In addition, Ogury also uses User Data for its internal purposes which may include:
Performing analysis and research aimed at improving the Ogury Product and the services and products Ogury provides to its Partners; and
Ensuring we get paid properly by advertisers for the Ogury ads we deliver, and that we pay Publishers properly for the Ogury ads displayed in their Partner Apps; and
Security and fraud detection (e.g. protecting against click-fraud and similar unlawful activities).
==========
Our approach to consent
We respect your right to privacy.
That's why we ask Users to give their consent before Ogury starts to collect any User Data from them.
In addition, Users may opt-out of such collection at any time by following the instructions outlined in the section titled “Opting Out of Ogury Interest­based Advertising”.
Accordingly, when Users use a version of a Partner App which contains the Ogury Product, a page is displayed which notifies them that, with their consent, certain User Data will be collected by the Ogury Product unless and until they subsequently opt-out from such collection.
So that Users are fully and properly informed about our data usage practices and how their User Data is collected, stored, used and shared, they are also provided with a link to this Privacy Statement.
If Users do not give consent, Ogury will not collect their User Data and will not deliver them targeted Ogury ads.
However, Users will still see advertisements in their Partner App, but the advertisements they see will not be tailored to them based on their User Data.
==========
We also keep records of the Google Advertising ID to allow us to identify which Users have opted out.
Opting Out of Ogury Interest-based Ogury Ads
Users can opt out of receiving targeted Ogury ads (and from having their User Data collected by Ogury) and request the deletion of their User Data by following the below link and entering their Google Advertising ID in the resulting form: https://consent.ogury.co.
When Users notify us of their desire to opt-out of receiving interest-based Ogury ads, we will promptly stop collecting their User Data.
If they opt-out, Users will still see advertisements in their Partner App, but the advertisements they see will not be tailored to them based on their User Data.
In addition, we will promptly anonymize or delete from our systems any User Data that we have already collected.
In addition to the opt-out process described above, if their Device permits, Users can opt out of interest-based advertising by changing the settings of their Google Advertising ID by clicking the button titled “opt out of interest-based advertising” by following these instructions: open Google Settings on your Device > Services > Ads > reset advertising ID.
Users should be aware that clicking this opt-out button will disable interest-based ads from all advertising networks that use Google Advertising IDs, although Users will still see untargeted advertisements.
