Terms of Service
This agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between you ("you") and Topix LLC, d/b/a Topix, (hereinafter referred to as "Topix") regarding your use of the Topix service (the "Service").
By using the Service, you are entering into this Agreement with Topix and indicating that you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.
If you do not agree with these terms and conditions as originally stated, please do not use the Service.
In addition, when using particular Topix owned or operated services, you and Topix shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted from time to time.
All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Topix properties, shall be subject to the Agreement.
==========
Priority.
This Agreement, in combination with Topix's Privacy Policy (available here), sets forth the terms and conditions under which Topix makes the Service available to you.
In the event of an inconsistency between this Agreement and Topix's Privacy Policy, this Agreement shall control.
==========
Rights Associated with the Service.
The Service is designed to help you find news information that resides on both Topix and on sites not owned or controlled by Topix.
In particular, the Service provides brief descriptions of news stories to help you identify the stories of interest to you.
When you select a story that appears to be interesting, you will be linked to either a Topix page that contains the full story or to the news site on which that story appears.
Topix owns and retains all intellectual property rights to the Service; but Topix does not claim ownership rights to the full news stories, which are instead held by the sites to which the Service links or other third party providers.
The news stories displayed as results, or linked to, by the Service are developed by people over whom Topix exercises no control.
The results that appear from Topix's indices are indexed by Topix's automated machinery and computers, and Topix cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the indices from which such automated search results are gathered.
==========
As a result, the Service may display results and links to sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive.
We cannot guarantee that a Topix page will not include unintended or objectionable content.
Topix assumes no responsibility or liability under any circumstances for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to by the Service.
==========
User Editor Platform.
The “User Editor Platform” is a segment of the Topix Service that allows a user to register with Topix as a “User Editor.”
Registering as a User Editor does not make you an agent or employee of Topix in any way.
This Agreement applies equally to User Editors and to any Content originating from User Editors.
==========
A User Editor will be provided access to Topix Wire (a collection of brief descriptions of news stories organized by locality/zip code and/or by subject).
As a User Editor, you will be able to select news stories of interest to you from Topix Wire and post such news stories (displayed as a headline and brief description) along with your own commentary and/or criticism about those selected news stories to the Topix News page.
As part of your own commentary and/or criticism, you may be permitted to upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available images, and/or hyperlinks related to those stories you choose.
As a User Editor, you may NEVER add, edit, delete, modify, or otherwise alter in any way a full news story, and you will not have access to do so on Topix’s Service.
The full news story will always be displayed only on its original site.
You may only upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available your own comments and/or criticism related to a particular news story.
==========
You are solely responsible for any material originating from you as set forth in the Content section of this Agreement.
As a User Editor, you will have the ability to choose forums of interest to you from Topix’s Forums page and post such forums along with your own commentary and/or criticism about them to the Topix News page.
As part of your own commentary and/or criticism, you may upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available images, and/or hyperlinks related to any forums you choose.
You are solely responsible for any material originating from you as set forth in the Content section of this Agreement.
As a User Editor, you will have the ability to promote a story to the Topix News page that you alone completely author.
You are solely responsible for any material originating from you as set forth in the Content section of this Agreement.
As a User Editor, you will have the ability to promote a URL to the Topix News page.
You are solely responsible for any material originating from you as set forth in the Content section of this Agreement.
==========
As a User Editor, you must make sure that any images and/or text that you post or link to as a URL and/or a hyperlink are under your explicit control.
Linking an image and/or text from another site that is not under your control can often result in that site changing the contents of what you linked possibly violating this Agreement.
If you choose to post a URL, hyperlink an image and/or any other content, you do so at your own risk to your account.
By hitting the [SUBMIT BUTTON], you are warranting that you have permission to post an image and/or hyperlink, even if it is subject to copyright protection.
==========
If you submit an image and/or content that is later alleged to be a copyright infringement, Topix will remove that image and/or content and comply with all related legal directives.
Topix will comply with any lawful demands related to all copyrighted work.
If the image posted to Topix is posted illegally, Topix will comply with state and federal law enforcement agencies in any action regarding the illegally posted image.
To the extent Topix is able to identify persons who are responsible for repeat postings of material in violation of copyright law or other terms of this Agreement, Topix reserves the right to terminate accounts of such repeat violators.
All rules set forth in the Content section of this Agreement apply equally to posting images and hyperlinks as well as all other forms of posting or linking.
==========
Registration.
When you register on Topix, you must provide true, accurate and complete registration information.
Should Topix suspect that your information is not accurate and complete, your account may be subject to suspension or termination.

To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time Topix is only available to users who are at least 13 years old.
If you are under 13, you may not register to use Topix service.

As part of the User Editor registration process, you will be asked to provide your full name, date of birth, email address, username and password, and a short description of your qualifications.
You will not be permitted to register as a User Editor unless you are registered as a Topix Community User.
You, not Topix, will be responsible for all activities occurring under your username and for keeping your password secure.
Please read Topix’s Privacy Policy for additional information as to Topix’s handling of your personal information.
Topix retains the right to revoke and/or terminate any user’s (including User Editor’s) registration and all privileges associated with such registration at any time, including for any violation of this Agreement.
==========
Use of the Service.
You may only display the content of the Service for your own personal use (i.e., non-commercial use) and may not otherwise copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content.
For example, you may not do any of the following: use the Service to sell a product or service; use the Service to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales; take the results from the Service and reformat and display them, or mirror any portion of the results on your Web site; or use the Service as part of a "meta-search" offering.
You also agree that you will not use any robot, spider, other automated device, or manual process to monitor or copy any content from the Service.
If you are uncertain whether your intended use of the Service is permissible, please contact us.

“User Editor Content” is any Content provided by and/or originating from a Topix User Editor, a user who properly registers on the User Editor Platform by providing all necessary information.
As used herein, “Content” refers to both User Content and User Editor Content unless expressly stated otherwise.
You understand that all Content is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated.
This means that you, and not Topix, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service.
You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it.

In connection with any and all Content provided by and/or originating from a Topix user or a Topix User Editor, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and/or permissions to use such Content and authorize Topix to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all Content to enable inclusion and use of the Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement.
You further agree that you will not submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material, and to grant Topix all of the license rights granted herein.
You understand that Topix does not monitor or control the content of information posted by others, and instead simply provides a service by allowing users to access information that has been made available.
Because Topix does not control the Content posted via the Service, Topix does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content.
You acknowledge that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.
Under no circumstances will Topix be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.

==========
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TOPIX OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO ANY USER (INCLUDING USER EDITORS) ON ACCOUNT OF THAT USER'S USE OR MISUSE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICE ARISING FROM ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.
SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO PREVENT RECOVERY OF DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, (EVEN IF TOPIX OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES).
SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE SERVICE, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, OR FROM THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING SUCH DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES).
THIS LIMITATION SHALL ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY REASON OF OTHER SERVICES OR GOODS RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON THE SERVICE OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY LINKS PROVIDED IN THE SERVICE, AS WELL AS BY REASON OF ANY INFORMATION OR ADVICE RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON THE SERVICE OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY LINKS PROVIDED IN THE SERVICE.

==========
Requests for Removal of Links or Cached Materials.
Topix occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from its indices.
Although Topix reserves the right to address such requests individually, the general approach that Topix takes reflects the following principles:
Topix's indices consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings.
Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Topix cannot and does not screen anything made available through its indices.
For each web site reflected in Topix's indices, if either (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third party in the second instance, Topix would consider on a case-by-case basis requests to remove the link to that site from its indices.
However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the automatic facilities used to create the indices are likely to find that site and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.
==========
Hold Harmless and Indemnity.
You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Topix, and its employees, agents and representatives, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to your use of the Service, including without limitation any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content (including but not limited to User Editor Content) you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation of any rights of another.
The foregoing includes, without limitation, indemnity for any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature.
In such a case, Topix will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.
==========
Release and Waiver.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release, and waive all claims against Topix and its employees and agents from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, arising out of or in any way connected with use of the Service.
If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
Residents of other states and nations similarly waive their rights under applicable and/or analogous laws, statutes, or regulations.
Modifications of Terms.
Topix shall have the right to modify the terms of this Agreement at any time, which modification shall be effective immediately upon posting.
==========
Accordingly, we suggest that you check this page periodically.
To make your periodic review more convenient, we will post a date at the bottom of this page.
Intellectual Property Policy.

Accordingly, it is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
To the extent Topix is able to identify persons who are responsible for repeat postings of material in violation of copyright law, Topix reserves the right to terminate accounts of such repeat infringers.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.
Topix's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive Topix's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format (including section numbers):

Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed.
For example, "The copyrighted work at issue is the text that appears on www.Topix.net/ads."

To file a counter notification with us, you must provide a written communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior agreement) that sets forth the items specified below.
Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is not infringing the copyrights of others.
Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
A sample counter notification may be found at http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca/counter512.pdf.
To expedite our ability to process your counter notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):

Identify the specific URLs of material that Topix.net has removed or to which Topix.net has disabled access.
Provide your name, address, telephone number, email address, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or Santa Clara County, California if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.
Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that each search result or message identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."

Trademark Compliance
As a provider of space for advertisements, please note that Topix.net is not in a position to arbitrate trademark disputes between the advertisers and trademark owners.
As stated in our Terms and Conditions, the advertisers themselves are responsible for the ad text that they choose to use.
Accordingly, we encourage trademark owners to resolve their disputes directly with the advertisers, particularly because the advertisers may have similar advertisements on other sites.
If you are a trademark owner (or represent a trademark owner) and have an objection to an advertiser's use of your trademark in ad text that is consistent with the foregoing, please provide the following information in a signed letter on company stationary:

Name of Company
Contact information (including email address)
List of trademark(s) at issue and the country/countries in which it is registered
The identity of the advertisement(s) at issue (via the URL stated on the bottom line of the ad)
The content in the advertisement that concerns you.
If your site has an affiliate program, are affiliates permitted to use the trademark in the advertisement's content?
==========
Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the trademarks described above with the advertisements described above is not authorized by the trademark owner or its agent, nor is such use otherwise permissible under law."
Include the following statement: "I represent that the information in this notification is true and correct and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the trademark owner."
Your signature.
==========
Please send this written communication with the above information to the address on our contact page.
Please Note: The foregoing procedure applies only to the use of trademarks in advertisements, which are clearly marked as advertisement on our pages.
We do not take action on objections to the use of trademarks in site to which we link.
For any such objections, please contact the site owner directly.

For example, Topix DOES collect such information from those users registering as Community Users and/or User Editors.
Topix notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query.
