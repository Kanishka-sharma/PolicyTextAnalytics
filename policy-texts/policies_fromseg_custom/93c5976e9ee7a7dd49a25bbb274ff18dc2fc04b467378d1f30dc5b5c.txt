Vitals recognizes that Your privacy and the protection of Your Personal Information is  important to you, and therefore, has adopted this VitalsSM privacy  policy.
This VitalsSM privacy policy describes our privacy practices  and how we treat the Personal Information that we collect from You when You use  products and services of Vitals, including any Personal Information we  collected from You when You created Your VitalsSM account.
The  VitalsSM privacy policy applies to all of the products, services,  and websites offered by Vitals or our related, affiliated and/or subsidiary  companies (collectively, the "Products and Services.")
For the purposes of this VitalsSM privacy policy, "Personal Information" is information that (i) You provide to Vitals and (ii) personally identifies You.
Such information includes your name, email or other address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked by Vitals to personally identify You.
The Personal information may also include "Sensitive Personal Information."
The Sensitive Personal Information is Personal Information that (i) is related to confidential medical information, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs and/or sexuality, and (ii) Vitals has actual knowledge thereof.
To protect Your privacy, Vitals does not associate Your website navigation activities to given Healthcare Providers and/or medical conditions, and excludes from the Personal Information certain information that otherwise would be Personal Information.
This "Excluded Information" is information that (i) is obtained via Your queries, searches or other interaction with Vitals, and (ii) relates to Healthcare Providers and/or medical conditions.
The Excluded Information, however, may be used for the purpose of generating "Aggregated Non-Personal Information," as described below.
Aggregated Non-Personal Information is information about some or all of the users of Vitals, but unlike the Personal Information, does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user.
The Aggregated Non-Personal Information may be formed from the Personal or Excluded Information, but any of the Personal or Excluded Information used to form the Aggregated Non-Personal Information has been processed to no longer reflect or reference an individually identifiable user.
