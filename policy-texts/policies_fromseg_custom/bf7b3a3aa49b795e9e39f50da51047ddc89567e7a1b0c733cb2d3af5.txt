In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
As described above, we, or other parties we do business with, may place or recognize unique cookies or other technologies on your browser and Device when you visit our Platform to collect information about your use of our Platforms and your other online activities over time and across different websites and apps, and may use that information to serve interest-based advertisements to you as you browse the Internet.

==========
There are 2 ways that you can opt out of IBA practices from certain iHeartmedia or third party ads on our Platforms and on third party sites and apps.
One way is through the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).
To opt out of IBA, please click on the following link and follow the instructions: DAA AppChoices – http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices/ and http://optout.aboutads.info.
To opt out from the use of information about your online activities for IBA by NAI member companies, visit: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
Another way to opt out of IBA is by clicking on the Advertising Options Icon featured on certain iHeartMedia ads on third-party websites.
When clicked it (i) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant third-party website and (ii) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the third parties listed for the purposes of IBA.
If you choose to opt out, our service provider will communicate your opt out election to the relevant third-party advertising partners and a cookie will be placed on your browser indicating your decision to opt out.
Bear in mind that because cookies are stored by your browser, if you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and Devices that have browsers and you do not wish to have cookies collect information for IBA purposes, you will need to opt out of IBA from each browser on each of the computers and Devices that you use.
Please note that even if you opt out of IBA, you may still receive advertisements from us; they just won’t be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites.
Please also note that if you opt-out of IBA, we may still track your visits to the Platforms for our own analytics, operations and security purposes.
