Privacy Statement for ANSI Online
The American National Standards Institute, Inc. ("ANSI") is committed to 
				protecting your personal information.
This Privacy Policy Statement applies to the following ANSI-administered website 
				(the "ANSI website"): www.ansi.org.
By using the ANSI website, you consent to the collection and use of information 
				by ANSI as set forth herein.
If ANSI changes its privacy policies it will post any changes to the ANSI 
				Privacy Policy Statement so please continue to check this Statement for any 
				updates.
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy Statement, please 
				contact us at info@ansi.org.
ANSI only collects information in order to assist your needs.
ANSI may collect 
				two different types of information: personally identifiable information you 
				choose to provide, and non-personally identifiable information to help us 
				better serve your needs.
Personally Identifiable Information:
ANSI collects information that you provide in order to provide you with ANSIâ€™s 
				services and/or products, and in some cases to contact you about our programs, 
				products or services.
Such information may include your name, email address, an 
				account password, and for the purchase or our products or services, payment 
				information.
==========
We do not sell, rent or trade your personally identifiable information to third 
				parties.
We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally 
				identifiable information that we collect, however, no data transmission over 
				the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
We may share non-personally identifiable information (information that does not 
				identify you individually) to our affiliates, partners or standards developers 
				in order to provide the product or service you have requested.
We may also 
				share personally identifiable information to satisfy any applicable law, 
				regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
We may use your personally identifiable information to send you additional 
				information about the products and services that we offer.
==========
We give you the 
				option not to receive such further promotional information.
We also provide you 
				with a means to review and modify personal information that you have provided 
				to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date, either directly online or by 
				contacting our web site administrator at info@ansi.org.
If you would like to change any of your personally identifiable information, 
				please send an email to info@ansi.org.
==========
Non-Personally Identifiable Information:
We use non-personally identifiable information to better understand your use of 
				the ANSI website and to enhance your enjoyment and experience.
The ANSI website may utilize a technology called "cookies" to assist returning 
				shoppers.
Cookies are small bits of data that web servers store on the user's 
				hard drive.
Cookies record information about visits to a particular site, and 
				can only be read back later by the site that created them.
Cookies store data 
				such as a log-in ID and password so that the user only has to enter that data 
				once.
Cookies make it possible to create a "shopping cart" into which the user 
				can place selections before checking out.
With cookies, a user can even log-off 
				half way through a shopping expedition and pick up later at the point where he 
				or she left the transaction.
==========
Though ANSI monitors traffic to its websites and 
				the pages that are visited, neither "cookies" nor data about individual 
				customers are correlated with viewing habits or shopping preferences.
You can disable "cookies" on your computer by indicating this in the preferences 
				or options menus in your browser.
However, it is possible that some parts of 
				the ANSI website will not operate correctly if you disable "cookies".
The ANSI website may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you 
				visit the ANSI website.
These companies may use information (not including your 
				name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this 
				and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services 
				of interest to you.
If you would like more information about this practice and 
				to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, 
				please contact us at info@ansi.org.

				councils or boards agree to the disclosure of their contact information.
