INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON OUR SITES.
Information You Provide To Us
The Platforms may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, email address, telephone number, home address or other profile-related information (“Personal Information”)).
For example, Clear Channel may collect Personal Information when you register on the Platforms, request information, submit comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature of the Platforms, or otherwise communicate or interact with us.
The Platforms may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests.
If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
Although you may use certain features of the Platforms without completing a registration or sign-up form, users who do register and/or sign up for special services may have access to additional features of the Platforms and may be more likely to receive information suited to their interests.
For example, a registered user is eligible for additional services provided by the Platforms such as listener clubs and personalized content.
To the extent the Platforms allow you to apply to become a customer of Clear Channel, additional information may be requested and collected from you via customer application forms and other forms.
If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.
==========
Shopping/Commercial Services.
The Platforms may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us.
If Platforms offer shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services.
The order form will ask you to give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age).
==========
Public Forums.
The Platforms may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups.
Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and is not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Statement.
Accordingly, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Personal Information.
==========
Information We Collect Automatically
Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, Clear Channel, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used (“Usage Information”).
Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, device type, operating system, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Platforms, such as song history, interaction with friends and group activities.
This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Platforms, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Platforms, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on.
This information helps us keep our Platforms fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor’s interests.
==========
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Clear Channel associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Clear Channel treats it as Personal Information.
Clear Channel also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Platforms.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
==========
The technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to:
Cookies.
Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms.
Clear Channel, or our third-party advertising service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms.
Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Platforms and pages visited.
Cookies allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Platforms.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies.
However, please be aware that some features and services on our Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Clear Channel account(s).
In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
==========
Pixel tags.
A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed.
In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.
The pixel tags on Clear Channel’s Platforms are set only by companies we work with and supervise.

To the extent that you provide us with financial related information in connection with shopping or commercial services offered through the Platforms, we will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services.
By submitting your credit card and related personal information to the Platforms, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.

ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT-OUT.
We license and/or utilize technology to serve advertisements on our own Platforms and within content as that content is served across the Internet.
In addition, we may also use third party ad network providers to help present advertisements on the Platforms, as well as third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of our Platforms and viewing of our content.
We do not share Personal Information with these providers unless you have expressly authorized us to do so, but they, like other advertising service vendors, may place and access cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive or flash memory or other form of storage of your Device to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on these Platforms and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.
In doing so, the provider collects or has access to non-personal data such as Web pages you have visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other Usage Information.
We and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Platforms and other websites.
We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.
The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.
==========
If you do not want to receive the benefits of targeted advertising, you may opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by visiting the NAI Opt-Out Page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you’re browsing online.
However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.
These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.
The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.

If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
