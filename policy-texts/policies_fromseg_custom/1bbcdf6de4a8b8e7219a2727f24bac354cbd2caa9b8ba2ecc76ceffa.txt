1	What is a cookie?
==========
1.1	Cookies are small text files they are stored by your browser onto your computer or mobile device.
They are widely used in order to make websites work or work in a better, more efficient way.
They can do this because websites can read and write these files, enabling them to recognise you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (eg by remembering your user preferences).
1.2	Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you do not want information collected this way, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookies feature (please read section 5 below for more details about how to do this).
1.3	We work with other third party organisations to provide the services on our website.
A third party is an organisation which is not hosted at the domain address in your browser when you visit our website.
These third parties may also use cookies on our website and can also place cookies on your device without you visiting their website directly.
If you would like more information about third party cookies, please read section 4 below.
==========
1.4	The two types of cookies we use are known as "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.
These may be cookies which we use and/or a third party uses.
1.4.1	Session cookie 

	A session cookie is used each time you visit our website to give you a session ID.
We use this type of cookie to link your actions on our website and each session cookie will only last for a browser session, at the end of which it will expire.
Each browser session will start when you open your browser window and finish when you close your browser window.
==========
After your visit to our website all session cookies are deleted.
Each time you visit our website you will have a different session ID.
1.4.2	Persistent cookie

	A persistent cookie allows your preferences or actions across a site (or across different sites) to be remembered.
It has a longer lifetime than a session cookie and lasts for the period of time specified in the cookie (this will vary from cookie to cookie).
This type of cookie will not be deleted when you close your browser window and will be stored on your device.
==========
It will be activated every time you visit a website which created that particular persistent cookie.
