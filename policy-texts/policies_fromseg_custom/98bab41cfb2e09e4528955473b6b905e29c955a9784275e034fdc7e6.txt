We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
Also remember to sign out of your Amtrak account and close your browser window when you have finished.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet "cafe."
When you give Amtrak personal information online, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside and separate from Amtrak and outside of the state where you originally entered the information.
