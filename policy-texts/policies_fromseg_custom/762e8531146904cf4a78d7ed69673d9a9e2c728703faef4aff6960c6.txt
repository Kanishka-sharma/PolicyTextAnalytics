In a nutshell: 
  Your Privacy and Security are a Top Priority at iHerb.
Since our inception back in 1996, iHerb has never shared, rented, or sold any customer information to any other party-- and never will.
==========
When you submit personal information on our website, your information is protected both online and offline.
We can only access your credit card (but not your actual credit card information) to issue credits, never for actual charges.
Only you can produce a charge by placing an order in your password-protected account.
==========
While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon of your web browser becomes locked.
This indicates that the connection between your web browser and our web server is secured.
While on a secure page, the 'http' on your browser changes to 'https'.
==========
When you submit sensitive information (such as your credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry  â€”(Secure Socket Layer).
We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it.
==========
And as always, iHerb.com will never sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other parties.
And we will never share it unless required by law.
==========

Like most standard website servers we use log files.
This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
==========
Disclosure to Third Parties
We use third party service providers such as credit card processors and delivery companies to assist us in fulfilling your order.
These companies use your information to authorize payment and to deliver your order to you.
==========
Otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, or transfer your personal information to third parties.
The information you give us is confidential, and will not be sold or given to any individual or company or organization.
This is our promise to you.

==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
==========
Security
When you submit personal information on our website, we will protect your information both online and offline.
When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - (Secure Socket Layer).
While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
==========
We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it.
For example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited access, secured facilities.
==========
iHerb.com's employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@iHerb.com.
