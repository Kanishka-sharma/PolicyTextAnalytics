You are responsible for providing Company with all identifying and tax information necessary for the payment of amounts due.
==========
By way of example only, if we received $10,000 from Users for the sale of your Courses during the month of June, no Users requested refunds, and the sales were subject to the Company Transaction Fee of 30%, Company would issue payment to you in the amount of $7,000 by July 31.
Similarly, if those same Courses were purchased through the Udemy Paid Advertising Program, Company would issue payment to you in the amount of $3,500 by July 31.
Notwithstanding the previous paragraphs of this section, for Courses sold through the Udemy Deals Program, Company will issue payment to you by the last day of the month following the month in which Company receives any payment from a Deal Site.
By way of example only, if a Deal Site received $10,000 from Users for your Courses during the month of June, no Users requested refunds, the Deal Site paid Company on August 15, and a Company Transaction Fee of 30% was applied, the Deal Site would retain $5,000, Company would retain $1,500, and Company would issue payment to you in the amount of $3,500 by September 30.

Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements
Company respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Users to do the same.
Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Company Products.
Company's intellectual property policy is to (a) remove material that Company believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Company Products, and (b) remove any Submitted Content posted to the Site by "repeat infringers."
Company considers a "repeat infringer" to be any User that has uploaded Submitted Content to the Site and for whom Company has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. 512(c) with respect to such Submitted Content.
Company has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Company's own determination.
==========
Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.
If you believe that any content made available on or through the Company Products has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a "Notification of Claimed Infringement" containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below.

A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.

Counter Notification.
If you receive a notification from Company that material made available by you on or through the Services has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Company with what is called a "Counter Notification."

==========
A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. 512 to confirm the party's obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.
False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.
The Copyright Act provides that: [a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [Company] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
17 U.S.C. 512(f).
==========
Company reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement or counter notification in violation of the law.

Dispute Resolution


Mandatory Arbitration.
Please read this carefully.
It affects your rights.
==========
YOU AND COMPANY AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE COMPANY PRODUCTS.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
==========
Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.
Commencing Arbitration.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a "Notice"), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Company, to you via any other method available to Company, including via e-mail.
The Notice to Company should be addressed to: Udemy, Inc., 425 2nd Street, Suite 250, San Francisco, CA 94107 (the "Arbitration Notice Address").
==========
The Notice must (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific relief sought (the "Demand").
If you and Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court.
THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
==========
The Rules and AAA forms are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Company, then Company will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Company's receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.
Arbitration Proceeding.
The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.
A single independent and impartial arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein.
You and Company agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
No Class Actions.
YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.
Decision of the Arbitrator.
Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.
The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice.
==========
All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.
The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.
The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration.
==========
You acknowledge that these Terms and your use of the Services evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
The United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in these Terms.
These Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles.
Only if the Mandatory Arbitration clause is deemed to be null and void, then all disputes arising between you and Company under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and you and Company hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.
==========
Equitable Relief.
The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which Company seeks equitable relief of any kind.
You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of these Terms by Company or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Company, including with respect to any Submitted Content, and your only remedy shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.
Claims.
You and Company agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.
Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
==========
Improperly Filed Claims.
All claims you bring against Company must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section.
All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section shall be considered improperly filed.
Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, Company may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that Company has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
