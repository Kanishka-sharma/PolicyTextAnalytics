Chicagotribune.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
Please note this policy applies only to information collected by Chicagotribune.com online and does not impact information collected or used by Chicagotribune.com or its affiliates through other means.
How we gather information from users.
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.
You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information.
Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g., newsletters, news updates and other products), sign up for a newspaper subscription or make a purchase.
You may also provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site.
Like most Web sites, Chicagotribune.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.

For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" technology.
Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.
As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password.
Additionally we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.
==========
What we do with the information we collect.
We will use your information only as permitted by law.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways.
As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive.
Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.
We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.

For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Chicagotribune.com to communicate with you regarding our Terms of Service and privacy policy, products and services offered by Chicagotribune.com and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners, administration of sweepstakes and contests, processing e-commerce transactions and other topics we think you might find of interest.
We reserve the right to share this information with other Tribune Company business units and affiliates, including for example our affiliated newspapers and entities in which Tribune Company has an ownership interest (collectively, "Affiliates").
This policy does not apply to any Affiliate's use of such information.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by Chicagotribune.com may also be used for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may access such information.
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses.
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities.
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
==========
Your choice to opt out.
The quality news and information on Chicagotribune.com is supported by advertising revenue and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our online publishing business.
Like other Web publishers, we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, features, products, special offers and unique content we believe might interest you.
If you prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information we might use for this purpose.
If you decline at the time you provide us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf.
