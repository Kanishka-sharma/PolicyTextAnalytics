What this Privacy Pledge covers
  This privacy pledge covers how Lulu treats personal information that Lulu collects and receives, including information related to your use of Lulu services.
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lulu does not own or control, or to people that Lulu does not employ or manage.
Information collection and use
General

  Lulu may collect personal information when you register, when you use Lulu services and when you visit Lulu pages or the pages related to the content contained within Lulu.
Lulu may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies in order to provide services you have requested from Lulu.
We do not purchase any personal data from other companies.
==========
Lulu collects information about your transactions with us and your use of the services that we offer.
Lulu automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser settings, and pages requested.
Lulu also requires a cookie, used only to keep track of your login status.
Lulu uses information for the following general purposes:
To fulfill your requests for products and services;
To improve our services;
To contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients;
To provide publisher correspondence via the Lulu Thank You Note program.
==========
As part of this program, Lulu may send e-mails containing a message from the publisher to the content purchaser.
None of the purchaser's personal information is disclosed to the publisher through this program.
We simply forward the publisher's Thank You Note and contact information to the purchaser on their behalf.
Purchasers may opt out of receiving correspondence from this program at any time.
==========
Registration
In order to publish or purchase content on Lulu.com, you will need to create an account.
When you register for an account, we will ask for your first and last name, email address, country, and language preference.
We will also ask you to create a username which will be visible if you post in the forums.
==========
Once you register and sign in to Lulu, you are not anonymous to us.
At the registration stage, you also have the opportunity to opt-in to news and updates from Lulu.
If you choose to opt-in, we may send you email communications such as newsletters and invitations to Lulu meet-ups in your area.
Whether or not you opt-in to news and updates from Lulu, there are still certain (very rare) types of email communications you will receive from Lulu.
These communications include site-critical announcements, changes to our Member Agreement, and any other communication it is necessary for all of our members to receive.
==========
Ordering
When you place an order on our site, we will ask for the name, shipping address, and phone number where you would like to receive your package.
This information is used for the purpose of shipping your order.
We will have to share your name and address with our shipping partners in order to complete the shipment, but our shipping partners are not permitted to use your information for any other purpose.
At the next step of the ordering process, we will ask for your payment information and billing address.
If you do not elect to pay with Paypal, we will ask for your credit card number, card security code, and expiration date.
This information is processed through Verisign for the purpose of completing your transaction, and is encrypted through secure socket layer (SSL) technology.
==========
Remission

In order to receive royalty and creator revenue payments from Lulu, you will have to provide remission information by clicking Change Remission Settings under the My Account tab.
On this page, we will ask for the name, address, and phone number where you would like to receive your payment.
If you request payment by Paypal, we will ask for your Paypal username in order to process your payment.
Your earnings as a Lulu creator are subject to US tax laws.
Therefore, in order to receive payment, you will have to complete the Taxpayer Information section.
We ask for your SSN, TIN, or EIN for the sole purpose of issuing a 1099 form for your earnings.
If you are not a US taxpayer, you can check the box beside “Not a US Taxpayer,” and you will not have to enter an SSN, TIN, or EIN.
==========
However, if you obtain a Lulu ISBN, any books that you sell to destinations within the US will be subject to withholding.
More information on how Lulu creators can comply with this law is available here: http://notes.lulu.com/royalty-taxes.
Newsletter

When you sign up for the newsletter at http://www.lulu.com/community, you are taken to a subscription form for the Lulu newsletter.
This form is provided by Topica, who gathers our subscriptions and sends our newsletter on our behalf.
The only information Topica receives through this form is your email address, which they are not authorized to use for any purpose other than sending you the Lulu newsletter.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Lulu does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies.
We only share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:
Agents: We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Lulu under confidentiality agreements.
These companies may only use your data as directed by Lulu, which includes using your personal information to help Lulu communicate with you, printing and shipping your books, discs, and other products, and completing financial transactions.
However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information, nor do they have any right to contact you for matters not pertaining to Lulu.
Service Providers: If you opt-in to receive newsletters and other email communications from Lulu, your email address will be collected and stored by Topica, our email campaign service provider.
Topica.com will not use your information for any purpose other than sending you emails on behalf of Lulu.
Lulu does not share your information with other third parties;
We may disclose your personal information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or as otherwise required by law;
We may disclose your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Lulu's terms of use;
We share information about you if Lulu is acquired by or merged with another company.
In this event, Lulu will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy pledge.
==========
If, as a registered creator, you enable your Thank You Note buyer notification option, you consent to permit Lulu to display the publisher name and e-mail address you provide on all Thank You Note correspondence to purchasers of your content.
If you include your personal information in content that you upload for posting and/or purchase on Lulu.com, that information may be widely available to other users.
Lulu does not exercise control over those users and cannot guarantee that your personal information will be protected as described in this Privacy Pledge if you make it available as part of content posted on Lulu.com.
Lulu does not delete or redact your personal information from content you provide.
If you do not want your personal information to be displayed as part of the content you upload, then you must delete it prior to uploading.
If you use our E-mail a Friend option to refer someone to a content page on our site, we will collect your friend’s name and email address.
This information is used only to email your friend the page you requested, and is not stored or used for any other purpose.
==========
Information Transfer
Lulu will transfer personal information about you to other countries where Lulu does business.
In particular, Lulu will transfer personal information from the EU to the United States for the purposes of providing users in the EU with the services and products Lulu offers.
Although other countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country where you reside, Lulu will apply the terms of this Privacy Pledge to all personal information that it collects.
==========
