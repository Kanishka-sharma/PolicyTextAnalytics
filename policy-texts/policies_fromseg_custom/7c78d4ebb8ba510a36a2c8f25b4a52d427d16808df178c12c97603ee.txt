Your Privacy Matters To Us!
Because CMPnet respects your right to privacy, we do not sell or rent our e-mail lists.
It is against CMPnet's policy to provide the information you have given us to any third party without your permission.
No third party will contact you through the use of our e-mail newsletter lists, except via advertisements within the newsletters themselves.
We will use the information you provide us only in the aggregate to give us demographic information about the CMPnet audience as a whole.
We do share this information with our advertisers to help them better understand our services, but we do not give them or any other third party information about individual users of CMPnet.
From time to time, we plan to reach out to a sample of our users in order to get a better sense of how we might better serve your needs and interests.
This information is subject to all of the above policies, and we will never require you to divulge any information you wish to keep private.
