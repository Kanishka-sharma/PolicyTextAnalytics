What Information We Collect
Personal Data
Personal data is information that can be used to identify an individual.
We process personal data that Users enter on our Site, send to us via email, or voluntarily provide to us in any other way.
Registering to become a customer of Intent (our “Clients”) requires the submission of personal data, including name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, website URL, credit card, and/or other payment information.
Our Site, Advertising Service, Personalization Service, and Analytics Service do not intentionally collect information that directly reveals your real-world identity, such as your name, address, phone number, or Social Security Number.
==========
Intent collects online identifiers and IP addresses through the use of cookies, web-beacons and other similar technologies, as explained below.
In some jurisdictions in which we operate, pseudonymous online identifiers and IP addresses are considered personal data.
Sensitive Information
Intent does not collect any of the following data in connection with the Services: social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers; insurance plan numbers; financial account numbers; information that describes the real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices (though we do collect IP addresses, which can provide approximate geographic location); or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic, and family medical history.
Device-Identified Consumer Data
Device-identified information is information that generally can’t be used by us to identify you personally.
==========
In some jurisdictions, device identifiers are categorized as personal data.
We may collect device-identified data in connection with our Site and Services including but not limited to a User’s purchasing intent, usage information, transaction information, login and visitor identifiers, IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.
In mobile applications where we have a presence, we may also collect mobile advertising identifiers such as IDFA and Google AdID.
Cross-Device Advertising
In some cases, we are able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or mobile device should be associated with the same identifier that we have previously assigned to another computer or mobile device.
In other words, in such cases, we are able to infer that a device (e.g. your computer) and another device (e.g. your smartphone) are used by the same user.
Where we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices and to improve the services we provide to our clients.
We refer to this as cross-device advertising.
Data Integrity
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
==========
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
How Collected Information Is Used
The data that Intent collects are used to better predict responses to custom content, to help determine which content performs best, and to evaluate which content is most appropriate for a given User.
The data may also be used to target advertisements and other content to people on the Client online properties they visit.
We may also share predictive scores of Users with the Client on whose property the User is visiting for the Client to use for personalization of content or advertisements, to optimize other Client advertising campaigns, or for other purposes the Client determines.
In addition, we may use the data to analyze trends, administer the Site and the Services, customize the advertising and content, track Users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We only use User data collected from an advertiser or publisher’s site to perform services for that advertiser or publisher.
==========
In some cases, we may use data from both an advertiser and a publisher to perform services for both parties by serving the advertiser’s ad on the publisher’s site, but we will not use data from an advertiser or a publisher ourselves or to perform services for others.
If a User voluntarily provides Intent with personal data in an email or by completing an online form, we use that personal data only to contact such User to respond to such User’s inquiry.
We use personal data of Clients to service accounts.
We may use personal data of users on our Site for our own corporate marketing purposes.
==========
Sharing with Third Parties, Onward Transfer
We may employ third-party companies and individuals to process payments, to facilitate the Services, to perform operational services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, cloud services, logging services, code monitoring services, web analytics and improvement of the Services’ features), to provide productivity services (e.g., email), for our own business-to-business corporate marketing and CRM efforts, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used.
These third parties may have access to information we’ve collected but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Intent may share aggregate information (which does not include device-identified information or personal data) about Clients and Users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

==========
In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Intent is potentially liable.
Legal Basis within the European Union
We process personal data for our Site and Services based on user consent (art. 6(1)(a) GDPR), for entering into and the performance of a contract with our customers (art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and based on legitimate interests (art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
When processing your data, we pursue the following legitimate interests: Improving our service, protection against abuse, statistics, the commercial advertising interests of our Clients, and our commercial advertising interests.
For our Services, we work with our Clients that operate as data controllers, which process personal data from Users; these data controllers work with us as a data processor.
For those scenarios, the privacy policy of the data controller is the applicable policy for the processing of User data.
==========
Cookies and other Targeting Technologies
Intent employs “cookies” and web beacons in connection with providing the Site and the Services.
Cookies are small packets of data, which may include a pseudonymous unique identifier, that are sent to a User’s browser from a server and stored on the User’s computer’s hard drive.
The online property placing the cookie on the User’s computer can then recognize the computer when the User navigates the online property at a later time.
For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
==========
Intent may also use statistical IDs in connection with the Services.
Statistical IDs are derived from information collected from your computer or device, such as your devices’ IP address, user agent string and types of fonts installed on your computer or device.
They don’t install software or leave anything permanently on your computer or device.
==========
Intent may use cookies, web beacons, JavaScript and statistical IDs for the purposes of helping us better understand when an internet User has seen or clicked on an advertisement or visited a web page.
These technologies help us tailor advertising messages served via the Services, to measure online page views and visits, and to support ad delivery and reporting purposes.
Users always have the option to prevent the use of cookies on their computers by changing the setting on their internet browsers to block cookies.
In addition, Users have the option to block the use of JavaScript, which may be used by Intent to display advertisements.
Controlling cookies and JavaScript may not have an impact on our use of Statistical IDs.
Since each internet browser is different, for more information, each User should review the documentation regarding the User’s specific browser.
Users are encouraged to review their privacy choices below under the section entitled “Choice / Opt-out.”
Users should be aware, however, that blocking the use of cookies or JavaScript may affect the User’s ability to access the functionality and content of certain online properties.
Data Retention
The cookies we set in connection with the Services expire after no more than thirteen months, and the expiration date may update every time you encounter our server.
Only our opt-out cookie (see below) has a different expiration date.
==========
We retain our raw log data, which includes data from the web and from mobile applications from which we receive data, for two years to help us understand historical seasonality trends.
We retain our aggregated data, which contains no pseudonymous identifiers or personal data, indefinitely.
Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use.
This also includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption.
Any data that is stored on Intent servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public.
Intent has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs.
==========
No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Please send questions about security to the address in the section “Contacting Us.”

==========
Rights of Access, Rectification, and Erasure of Information
Intent operates the Services as a data processor on behalf of its customers.
For access, rectification, or erasure of your information, please contact the owners of the online property where the data was collected, as they operate as the data controllers.
For full-browser-window advertisements hosted on the intentmedia.net domain, the privacy policy link in that browser window will link to the Intent Client acting as data controller for the data processed in that window.
The data controller will then be able to contact us to access, rectify, or erase information we maintain about you on their behalf.
For data subject requests for personal data that we control, please send us an inquiry to the address in the “Contacting Us” section below.
==========
Third-Party Sites
