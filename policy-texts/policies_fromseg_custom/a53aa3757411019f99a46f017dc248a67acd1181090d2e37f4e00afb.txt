This Privacy Policy describes Cazamba’s practices and policies with regard to the use and processing of data when providing the Service.

The platform provides tools for advertisers to buy advertising space on digital properties on websites, and for website owners (“Publishers”) to offer and sell their advertising space.
We also provide tools that can be used to ensure that advertisements are shown to users who are likely to have an interest in a particular ad, and we provide a technology that enables the delivery of advertising content to a website.

Cazamba allows Internet Users to Opt-out of: 

Cookie-based targeted advertisements using Cazamba’s Services.
Tracking of visits across domains and sites through Cazamba technology.
Any type of cookie-based tracking by third-party technology through Cazamba.
The opt-out process erases the previously set cookie and places an alternative Cazamba cookie into the Internet user’s browser with a special indication of an “opt-out” choice and with no other data.
Since random identification numbers of those two cookies are different, no data attributed to the previously set cookie can be attributed to the new “opt-out” cookie.

The cookie applies to the specific computer or mobile device and browser combination only.
If an Internet user wishes to opt-out on other browsers, computers or mobile devices, he or she must repeat the process.
Please also note that if all cookies are erased from the computer or mobile device, the opt-out cookie is also erased and the process must be repeated.
