The Types of Information that We Collect

The Websites
We collect two types of information from visitors to our Websites: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is information that may be used to identify or locate an individual and includes email address, telephone number or postal address.
We generally don’t collect PII via the Websites unless it is provided to us.
For example, if you purchase our products or services we may request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.
This includes contact information such as your name, email address, and address, as well as financial information such as a credit card number and its expiration date.
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, we also will use this information to contact you.
==========
In addition, if you contact us by email or otherwise provide your email address to us through our Websites, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence.
We reserve the right to use your email address and any other PII that you provide to us to respond to your inquiries and to send you marketing materials for our own products and services.
We also reserve the right to share contact information you provide to us in connection with accessing certain content through our Websites (for example, webinars with industry partners) to our production partners or sponsors of such content.
We will not otherwise share your contact information with outside parties for the purposes of marketing other products and services to you without your consent.
We also collect non-personally identifiable information via the Websites (“Non-PII”) such as the name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the computer or device you are using, the type of browser and operating system that you use, the date and time you access our Websites, the website referrer address and other log file information.
==========
Like most websites, our Websites use “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, “cookies” and/or similar tracking technologies that allow us to track the actions of visitors to our Websites.
We use this information to help us improve our Websites and the products, services, applications, content and features that we provide.
We reserve the right to aggregate this information with similar data collected from other visitors to the Websites for any purpose, including publishing aggregate statistics about our Clients’ and/or Websites’ visitors.
The Ad Serving Platform
The Bounce Exchange ad serving Platform does not directly collect PII.
This Platform enables our Clients to collect Non-PII via pixel tags, cookies, web beacons and/or similar tracking technologies.
The type of non-PII collected via the Platform includes IP address, browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider, referrer address and other log file information.
This information is used to offer products and services designed to help our Clients better understand how their websites are being utilized, draw insights on how to better engage Users on their sites, to deliver more relevant advertising messages based upon the User visits to individual Client sites, and to provide Clients with ad delivery reports.
The Behavioral Automation Platform
Bounce Exchange collects email addresses and other PII such as telephone number via our behavioral automation Platform.
We typically obtain this information from our Clients that collect it via online forms on Client websites or directly from Users via online forms on Client websites.
We combine this with Non-PII also collected via Client websites to help our Clients with conversion tracking, site optimization and conversion.
Bounce Exchange and our Clients may also use this information to send customized and retargeted email marketing messages to our Clients’ customers and prospective customers and we may use aggregate, Non-PII to improve our Platforms, products or services.

Choice Mechanisms
