LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We process your personal information based on the following legal bases, as recognised by and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws:
the processing is necessary to perform our contract with you (i.e. the Terms and Conditions that apply as applicable with respect to our services, for the provision of our services), or to take steps requested by you before entering into said contract;
you are obliged to provide us with personal data as it is necessary to enter into and perform our contractual agreements.
In the event that you do not wish to provide us with your personal data for the purposes outlined above in the “How and why we use your information?”
section, we will not be able to perform our contractual agreement with you;
the processing is in Payoneer’s or someone else’s legitimate interests, and these interests are not overridden by your interests or rights in the protection of your personal data.
This may include processing your data for identification or prevention of suspicious or high risk transactions or fraudulent activity, internal research and analytics assessments, for purposes of communication with you, and informing you about new products and services we are offering or to promote new products and services of other parties which we think may be of interest to you, etc.;
before we process your personal data to pursue our legitimate interests for the purposes outlined above in the “How and why we use your information?”
section, we determine if such processing is necessary and we carefully consider the impact of our processing activities on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
On balance, we have determined that such processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and that the processing which we conduct does not adversely impact on these rights and freedoms.
you have given your consent to the processing of your data;
the processing is necessary to meet a legal obligation which applies to Payoneer.
Sometimes we process data about you which the law considers to fall within special categories (see section “HOW, WHEN AND WHAT WE COLLECT?”

the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
you have freely given your informed, specific consent to the processing; or
the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on applicable law.
==========
If you would like more information about the legal grounds used to process your information, or about the legitimate interests referred to above, please contact us.
In cases where we have asked for, and you have given, your consent to our processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time.
==========
You can do this by contacting our DPO at DPO@payoneer.com.
DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE US YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
==========
In most cases, providing your personal data to us is optional, however, if you do not provide it, you will not be able to use our Services.
For example, we need details such as your name, address and bank account details so that we can make payments to you and receive payments from you.
In other cases, you have a choice over whether we collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on your browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case you may not be able to use all parts of our Website).
==========
PROFILING AND AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
We use automated decision making as part of our process to evaluate eligibility for the use of the Payoneer services.
We use these tools as a measure of fraud prevention and for the purposes of security and risk assessment relating to the performance of the Payoneer services, and to verify your identity when you become a customer:
Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of your registration application: based on the information you provide, the tool may advise if additional information is required for purpose of approval of your application.
Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of certain payment transaction of registered users: such tools may advise if additional information is required for purpose of performance of the payment transaction.

==========
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Payoneer retains your personal data for the duration of your engagement with us and for a period following termination of your engagement with us, as required by applicable laws or regulations and/or in accordance with Payoneer’s internal policies and procedures for purposes of prevention of fraudulent activity, risk management and security.

Correcting your personal data
You can ask us to correct any personal data which is inaccurate or incomplete.
This is free of charge.
If we have shared the personal data with anyone else, we will tell them about the correction wherever possible.
If we cannot action a request to correct your personal data, we will let you know and explain why this is.
Erasing your personal data
This right is sometimes referred to as “the right to be forgotten”.

You can ask for your personal data to be erased where:
it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed;
we are processing your personal data based on your consent, and you withdraw that consent;

Please note, in connection with such requests, that personal data may be either deleted or retained in an aggregated manner without being linked to any identifiers or personal data, depending on technical commercial capability.
Restricting the processing of your personal data
You can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in some circumstances, free of charge.
This is not an absolute right.
==========
If processing is restricted we can store the personal data and retain enough information to make sure the restriction is respected unless you consent or the processing is necessary in relation to a legal claim or to protect the rights of another person or for reasons of important public interest, but we cannot further process your personal data.
You can restrict the processing of your personal data in the following cases:
if you contest the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict processing until we have made sure the personal data is accurate;
if you object to our processing pending the verification of whether or not our legitimate interests override your interests, rights and freedoms or in connection with legal proceedings;
if the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your personal data;
if we no longer need the personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
==========

We will tell you if we decide to lift a restriction on processing your personal data.
Objecting to the processing of your personal data
You have a right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time.
This request will befree of charge.
==========
It is not an absolute right, but you can object to our processing of your personal data where it is:
based on the legitimate interest ground; or
for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.

You can require us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
We will stop as soon as we receive your request.
There are no exemptions or reasons for us to refuse.
==========

It applies where the following conditions are met:
you provided the personal data to us yourself;
we are processing the personal data either based on your consent or because it is necessary for the performance of a contract; and
the processing is carried out by automated means.
We will provide your personal data free of charge in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form.

We will tell you about any automated decision making that affects you.
You have the right to:
request human intervention;
express your point of view;
ask for the decision to be explained; and
challenge the decision.
==========
These rights are not absolute.

based on your explicit consent.
==========
