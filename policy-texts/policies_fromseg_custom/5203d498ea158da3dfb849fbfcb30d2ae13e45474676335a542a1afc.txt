online marketplace.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE 
Information You Provide 
Evidon may ask you to provide us with personal information through email
communications if you would like to take advantage of the services we offer.
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an
individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone
number, and email address.
We use this information to allow you to post
comments on our blogs, respond to your requests and otherwise provide you with

We allow you to subscribe to our blog and receive notifications of new posts by
email.
If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of email
communications please see the "Choice/Opt-out" section below.
==========
We may also use aggregate clickstream information we collect from our
website users.
This information does not personally identify you and is used
primarily to monitor traffic to the website, so we can continue to enhance the
website and our services.
Usage Tracking 
We may track usage of Evidon.com to improve the services we offer and our
website.
We collect user traffic patterns throughout our website using text
files called cookies which do not contain personal information.
This
information will only ever be collected to help improve website flow and
usability.
In addition, we track click-through information, including IP
addresses, to our website from the reports and emails we send to our customers.
This is done to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and to
discourage fraudulent use.
However, we do not correlate this information with
any personal information of individual users.
==========
Cookies 
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of
your computer.
The cookie itself does not contain personal information,
although it will enable us to relate your use of this website to information
that you have specifically and knowingly provided.
A cookie cannot read data
off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.
Evidon may
use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).
You can refuse
cookies by turning them off in your browser.
If you have set your browser to
warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with

Third Party Cookies 
Evidon does not allow third party cookies on Evidon.com.
However, we may use
third party providers to power certain services like the Evidon blog (located
at http://blog.evidon.com), which may use third
party cookies, for example session ID cookies, to make it easier for you to
navigate our site.
The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our
privacy statement.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) 
Third party providers who service our website, like the Evidon blog, may employ
a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that
help them better manage content on our site.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with
a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the
online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a
user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and
are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
==========
We do not tie the
information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable
information.

be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be

identifiable information you choose to disclose in these blogs.

purposes.

will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed
to provide you services.
