Adelaide is a digital media technology company that may track advertisements on the websites you visit.
Adelaide understands that your online privacy is important to you.
We have created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect on the Adelaidelift.com website and when we track our customers’ (referred to as “Advertisers”) digital ads, how such information is used, and how it is shared with third parties if shared at all.
Please read this privacy policy carefully.
==========
Use of this website, sharing of information with us or engagement with ads tracked by Adelaide, is subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
When using this website, sharing information with us or engaging with ads we track, you give your agreement to this Privacy Policy.
The Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time by us as further described below.
==========
The terms “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to the website visitor or consumer.
The terms “Adelaide,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Adelaide, the digital media analytics platform, and its related services (collectively, “Adelaide Entities”).

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Ad Delivery Reporting Across Multiple Sites
As part of our ad tracking and reporting, we log page views and collect information for the purpose of providing media analytic services, including tracking types of access device and connection speed, statistical reporting in connection with the dimensions, position of and duration of an ad on a website, and tracking the number of ads served at a particular time to a particular website.
To do so, we collect information about the type of browser and operating system of website visitors, as well as the domain name, day and time of visit, and URL(s) visited.
We do so across multiple web domains owned or operated by different entities (each, a “Site”).
==========
Internet Technology
We collect the information described above by using web beacons, log files, and cookies.
We often engage or cooperate with service and technology companies to collect this information.
While this tracking and collection technology is commonly used, you might not be familiar with it, and we would like to explain it:
“Web beacons” are electronic files used to track your navigation of the web page on which you saw a given ad that Adelaide is set to track.
We do not use web beacons for their other typical purposes, such as the completion of transactions, and submittal of applications.
“Log files” track actions occurring on websites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and types of advertisements viewed.
Adelaide works with ad exchange platforms to place cookies on your computer.
“Cookies” are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, tablet, or mobile device) can store.
==========
Adelaide does occasionally work with a third party to send consumers an in-browser survey, that is unobtrusive and optional, for quality purposes.
Not all people who see an ad that Adelaide interacts with will get a cookie.
==========
We abide by the cookie policies of the third-party that helps us with this, and we audit them for safe handling of cookie data.
The cookie will only be used for the purposes of this momentary quality survey.
You can learn more about cookies on the Internet Advertising Bureau’s website: http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
==========
We use the information we collect to determine which media is best at yielding a quality and efficient experience with online ads, to assist us in improving the operation of our services, to maintain the quality of our services, to enhance our services to our business partners and clients, to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Adelaide’s services, and for the other purposes described below.
Personally Identifiable Information
Adelaide does not collect or use Personally Identifiable Information (PII) common to Interest-Based Advertising (IBA).
PII is any information that identifies you or can be used to identify you.
==========
This includes, but is not limited to, your name, telephone number, address, email address, and date of birth.
Adelaide does not collect PII.
Adelaide will not collect PII unless you choose to provide it to us, such as if you choose to do so as part of your interaction with Customer Forms, or Employment Forms, on the Adelaidelift.com corporate site.
Examples of such Customer or Employment Forms include but are not limited to: registration forms to access Adelaide published white papers or Adelaide produced webinars, forms providing customer contact information when requesting information from Adelaide and forms to apply for open employment opportunities within Adelaide.
==========
Customer or Employment Forms are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18 or those who are not residents of the United States.
If you are not 18 years of age or older and a resident of the United States or you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not provide us with any information or use any of the Customer Forms.
==========
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Non-PII is data that is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device, but is not PII, including, but not limited to: your IP address, web pages which you have viewed, and your responses to surveys.
This information may be collected using different types of internet technologies, such as cookies (see “Internet Technology” above for more details).
Adelaide may collect this information when you are visiting the Adelaide corporate site or any website where we track the ads of Advertisers.
However, this information is not combined with PII.
==========
Information Obtained From Other Companies
We license and otherwise obtain Non-PII from various other companies, including research companies, data aggregation companies and other third-party companies.
Data sets may include information about you that such companies have licensed, purchased or collected.
==========
We use this information for all the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and for any other purpose that we choose.
Sharing Your Information
Adelaide may use and share your information: (1) to enable third party service providers to assist or facilitate in the services we provide to our clients; (2) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (3) to enforce our terms of use or to protect our rights; (4) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of our services; (5) with third party marketing partners; (6) with third party research companies, vendors, administrative service providers, technology providers, and selected partners for data validation, aggregation, enhancement, verification and suppression purposes, and for research, marketing, advertising, and data aggregation purposes; (7) for the purposes described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy; or (8) for any other purpose for which you provide consent.
Generally we expect these uses to occur within the limited scope of service and activities as described above.
Information provided on Employment forms are only used internally by Adelaide and may disclose PII to third parties under the following circumstances (1) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law requiring such disclosure; (b) protect the rights or property of Adelaide; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security or (d) protect the personal safety of the users or the public.
==========
CORPORATE CHANGES
In the event that Adelaide is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information is treated, transferred, or used.
==========
Information Collected By Third Party Sites
Please be aware that the Sites of our advertiser clients as well as the Sites on which we track advertisements or any Site linked to from one of our websites also may collect information from you.
These are independent third parties, not affiliated with Adelaide, who we do not form any collaborative nor meshed service offering.
Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully, Adelaide is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by such third parties.
You should check the applicable privacy policies of such websites you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you, and the scope of that information.
We make you aware of these third parties as a courtesy.
==========
Data Retention
Our survey partner may use cookie technology, for purposes outlined above.
If you have cookies disabled, if you delete your cookies, or if other software deletes the cookies used for that data storage, such data is lost because it is not retained separately by Adelaide.
The cookies that store data will in any case expire, at latest, one year after the last time such information is stored, barring any technical malfunction.
==========
Adelaide retains information regarding ad delivery (see, “Ad Delivery & Reporting” above) until such time as we delete it.
Adelaide may delete any or all of IBA or information regarding ad delivery that relates to you at any time and in Adelaide’s sole discretion, notwithstanding its normal data retention policies.
==========
Further, Adelaide reserves the right to retain and use any information described in this Privacy Policy as reasonably necessary to comply with laws or regulations, notwithstanding any limitations described in this Privacy Policy to the contrary.
If Adelaide changes its data retention policies by updating this Privacy Policy, its new policies will apply to all data collected after the effective date of those changes.
==========
YOUR CHOICES
IBA Opt-Out
Adelaide is committed to providing consumers notice and choice regarding IBA.
Adelaide offers an “opt-out option” for those that wish to opt-out of any Adelaide IBA activities.
This option will honor your IBA preferences for a period of up to 1 year.
==========
If you have multiple Internet browsers or users on the same device, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each browser and/or user.
If you or your anti-virus or other software clears information from your device, if you re-install your browser, or if you delete your cookies (which can happen if you clear or delete your browser history), then you may need to repeat this process.
==========
Adelaide may be unable to provide you with an opt-out cookie if your browser is set to block third-party cookies.
To opt-out of IBA, please use our opt-out tool from the mobile device that you wish to disable tracking on.
That can be found here or at http://www.adelaidelift.com/opt-out/
Please report any problems related to the opt-out process to privacy@adelaidelift.com
Further, Adelaide does not collect or use for the purpose of IBA, data that is considered personal data or sensitive personal data under the respective national implementations of the EU Directive 95/46/EC.
==========
Children's Privacy
Adelaide is very sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy.
Adelaide’s products and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children.
Adelaide does not employ or offer advertising targeting towards children under the age of 13.
If you believe your child has provided us with PII through the Adelaide corporate site or through our corporate marketing materials, please contact us and we will delete any such data.
Security
Adelaide employs industry-standard measures to ensure the security of all information.
We routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services.
==========
No transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure.
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security.
You acknowledge and agree to assume these risks when communicating with us.
==========
Jurisdictional Issues
The Site and information we maintain is controlled, stored and operated within the United States and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.
By using this Site and submitting any information you consent to the transfer and storage of information to the United States.
==========
Changes
Adelaide may find it appropriate or necessary, or may be legally obligated, to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date (found at the bottom) so that you have a way to always become aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
==========
For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of information you have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent (if we have the necessary contact information) before implementing such revisions with respect to such information, or notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our website or by directly sending you a notification.
For all other changes, it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.
