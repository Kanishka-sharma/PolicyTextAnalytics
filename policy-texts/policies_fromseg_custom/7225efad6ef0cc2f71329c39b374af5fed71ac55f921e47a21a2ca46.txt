General Privacy Information
Information security
The security of your information is important to us.
We take security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
These include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict data access to a subset of 33Across employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Products and services.
These individuals are bound by confidentiality and data security obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations.
==========
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
==========

Information Relating to Children

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.
We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under the age of 13 and no part of our Website or Products are designed specifically to attract people under the age of 13.
If we are made aware that we have received any information from anyone under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.

Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
We do not rent or share your PII with non-affiliated third parties without your consent.
We may, however, share your PII with trusted third-party contractors who provide services for us.
These third-party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us.
==========
We may share DII collected on the Website or via our Technology with unaffiliated third parties.
These also include third party marketing partners, with whom we share DII for commercial purposes.
For example, we may disclose to a marketing data broker that our online advertisements offering ‘sports car’ test drives receive more clicks than those offering ‘mini van’ test drives.
We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
==========
Finally, in the event we are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or undergo another change of control, we reserve the right to transfer information, including any PII and DII, to a successor entity.
You understand that we may not be able to control how your information is used in the event of such a change of control.
