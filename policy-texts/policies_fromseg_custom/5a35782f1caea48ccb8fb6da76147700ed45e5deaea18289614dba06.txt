TrafficSwarm.com takes your privacy seriously,
        and has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm
        commitment to online privacy.
Please read the following to learn more about our information gathering
          and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable
          information.
IP Addresses

          We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our web server,
          and for the general administration of our website.
Your IP address,
          should you decide to create a TrafficSwarm account, is also used to
          prevent you from registering twice due to temporary technical problems.
Cookies

          Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent
          to your computer.
A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a
          unique user.
It stores personal preferences and user data, however,
          in no way does this tell us who you are.
TrafficSwarm.com has two primary
          uses for its cookies.
==========
First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may
          be presented to you as you navigate our website.
This is done so that
          you are not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions
          over and over, or after you have indicated you are not interested in
          a particular offer.
We also use cookies to help track referring web
          sites.
While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors
          to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web
          browser.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
You can
          reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie
          is being sent.
==========
