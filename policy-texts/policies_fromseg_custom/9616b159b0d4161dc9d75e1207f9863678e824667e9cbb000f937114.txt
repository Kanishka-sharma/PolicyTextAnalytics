Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us.
At Shareably Media, LLC (“Shareably” or “we” or “us”) we have a few fundamental principles:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it (we can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason).
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
==========
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals and recognizes the need to protect the privacy of the personal information you provide to Shareably with respect to your access and use of Shareably’s website (www.shareably.net) (the “Website”).
Therefore, we have adopted this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which sets forth, among other things, the type of information that will be collected, the purpose and use of the collected information, and your rights with regard to the collected information.
By accessing the Website, you are consenting to the collection and the use of your information by Shareably, but only to the extent described herein.
Should you wish to revoke your consent, you may do so in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 below.
Shareably may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this Privacy Policy (“Changes”) at any time.
Changes will be effective: (i) thirty (30) days after notice of the Changes is provided through the Website or otherwise; or (ii) when you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of this Privacy Policy incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first.
