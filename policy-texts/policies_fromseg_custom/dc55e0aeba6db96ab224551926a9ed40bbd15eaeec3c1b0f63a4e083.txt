Ten Tips for Protecting Your Privacy Online

Look for the TRUSTe trustmark on a Web site's home page.
Clicking on it will 
    show you the site's privacy policy.
Be aware that when you provide your name and/or messages to others online 
    (through bulletin boards, chat groups, etc.) they'll likely be able to find 
    out how to communicate with you-whether you want them to or not.
Read the privacy policy of individual Web sites.
==========
Find out what information 
    they gather, how they use it, and who they share it with.
Check whether the site has an "opt-out" policy, which allows you to prevent 
    further solicitation or sharing of personal information with third parties.
If they don't already have one, ask your favorite of our list of the 100 most popular sites
    to post an easy-to-locate, clear privacy policy (see our Privacy Challenge for help).
==========
Guard your password-change it often and never offer it to anyone who asks for it 
    online.
Instruct your children never to give out their name or other personal information 
    online without your permission.
Check a computer reseller for software tools (e.g., anonymizers, cookie cutters) 
    that provide a layer of additional privacy protection online.
Report privacy violations and misuse of trustmarks to TRUSTe (see 
    Watchdog), or to the specific online 
    authority if the site is not a TRUSTe participant.
==========
Most important, use common sense and be aware.
You wouldn't give personal 
    information to just anyone in the offline world . . . you should apply the same 
    discretion online.
