==========
This is a new privacy policy, effective as of the date listed above.
Even if you read and approved a prior policy, you
need to review this updated version.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the homepage of the
Website, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use
it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via
either email or by posting a notice on the Website for 30 days.

Personal Information
Users have the option of providing various types of personal information to make the best use of our Website.
Providing
personal information is voluntary.
==========
This section describes what we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it.
We only disclose information in compliance with applicable laws.
By providing this information, you agree to its use
consistent with this policy.
==========
Zip Code Only: On our comparison shopping sites, you have the choice of providing your zip code.
We use your
zip code to compute total price including the cost of shipping and sales tax.
We do not share this information with
third parties.
E-mail Address Only: If you wish to register for either Price Alerts (through our Watch List feature) or our
Buyer's Alert Newsletter, we require that you provide us with your email address.
We do not share these e-mail addresses
with third parties.
==========
Basic Contact Info: When a visitor decides to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact
information, such as username, zip code, and email address.
We use this basic contact information to facilitate the use
of certain features of our Website (e.g., total price and submission of seller reviews) and to send the user information
about our company.
We also use email addresses to communicate occasional offers from our partners and advertisers.
We
do not share this basic contact information with third parties.
==========
Complete Contact Info: When a user wishes to be contacted by a merchant, such as an auto dealer in their local
area, we collect full name, e-mail address, and phone number.
NexTag forwards this personal information on to
appropriate merchants.
When a registered user decides to become a seller, we collect complete contact information, i.e., full name, address,
e-mail address, and phone number, as well as credit card number and expiration date.
We use this information to
validate the seller's identity and to bill the seller for services provided by NexTag and approved in advance by the
seller.
==========
All credit card information is encrypted.
With the exception of our credit card processing service, we will not
share your credit card information with third parties without your approval.
The credit card processing company may
retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for their internal purposes.
==========
Service User Information: When a user wants to receive information about, mortgages, real estate services, or
insurance, NexTag requests that Service Users complete a questionnaire, which includes personal financial and contact
information ("Service User Information").
Service User Information enables NexTag to provide Service Users with
information about requested services.
We do not provide a means of updating Service User Information.
Any updates
should be provided directly to the Service Providers that contact the Service User.
In the questionnaire, we obtain consent from a Service User to disclose Service User Information to Service Providers,
such as participating banks, mortgage brokers, loan brokers, financial institutions, and in some cases aggregators
(collectively, "Lenders"), as well as real estate brokers, insurance companies, and insurance agents.
==========
In the
questionnaire, we state that we cannot provide our services without such consent.
When a Service User provides consent,
we will disclose Service User Information only authorized and permitted by applicable laws.
NexTag does not have
control over the use of such Service User Information by the Lenders and other Service Providers, however.
The Service
User's rights regarding such use will be governed by the policies of the Lenders or other Service Providers with whom
the information is shared.
==========
After the Service User has left our Website, we continue to treat Service User Information as
confidential and do not disclose it to third parties other than as authorized by the Service User and explained in our
Privacy Policy.
Use of Personal Information

been opened by the recipients.
