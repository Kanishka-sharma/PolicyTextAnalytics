Please review the UCAR Privacy Policy so that you can understand

What Personal Information Does UCAR Collect?
You can visit 
              the UCAR Web site without identifying who you are, or revealing 
              personally identifiable information.
If you do provide personal 
              information when signing up for a service, UCAR will not sell, trade, 
              or give away your information.
General Use Information.
==========
UCAR receives and stores certain 
              types of information whenever you interact with the web site.
For 
              example, UCAR maintains web activity log files such as the number 
              of pages requested, time spent on a page, and result sets from search 
              queries.
==========
UCAR extracts and aggregates information from these log 
              files to gauge and improve the effectiveness of the web site and 
              services.
UCAR does not link this general use information to other 
              personably identifiable information.
From time to time, UCAR may share information with outside contractors, 
              auditors, consultants, and others hired by UCAR to assist in carrying 
              out financial or operational activities.
UCAR informs these parties 
              about safeguarding personal information, and requires them to use 
              it only for an authorized purpose consistent with this privacy policy.
==========
Cookies.
Parts of the UCAR web site may use cookies to improve 
              the your interaction with the site or service.
UCAR does not use 
              cookies for tracking purposes except when used in conjunction with 
              a service that requires keeping track of a session, or actions, 
              (e.g. a service allowing a user to see their previous search queries) 
              and you have agreed to this when signing up to that service.
Signing Up For Services.
In some instances, UCAR may request 
              information through an enrollment process for a web service, web 
              site analysis, survey, or event registration.
==========
To enroll, you may 
              voluntarily supply personal information.
UCAR shall use the information, 
              and may share the information with event planners, only as described 
              in the enrollment process.
==========
Contact the web site operator to correct 
              any information you submit.
From time to time UCAR will conduct surveys of visitors to the 
              site to obtain demographic information.
Such information will be 
              compiled and shared only within UCAR.
==========
Security.
UCAR maintains all personal data with technical, 
              administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, 
              unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper 
              use.
No computer system or information can be completely protected 
              against every possible hazard, but UCAR provides reasonable and 
              appropriate controls to protect personal information against foreseeable 
              hazards.
==========
Public Forums.
UCAR maintains a number of public email lists 
              and forums for use by interested individuals.
Some are open for 
              subscription and use; others are moderated where a list or forum 
              moderator may limit subscription and posting access.
==========
In each case, 
              users can subscribe and unsubscribe from these areas at any time.
Contact the web site operator to correct any information you submit.
==========
Please note that any information that you post to a public bulletin 
              board or chat room is available to all persons accessing that site.
Unsubscribing from a list or forum will not remove any name, email 
              address or information that was part of any previous posting from 
              any archive of these lists or forums.
==========
Legal Requirements.
UCAR may disclose information in response 
              to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.
==========
Children’s Guidelines.
Students are advised to consult with 
              their parents before giving any personal information online.
UCAR 
              may provide services either directed at children grades K through 
              12, or where children are expected to be among the users.
==========
Two common 
              examples are a virtual library reference desk and an "Ask-A" service 
              to allow students to either send a question to a librarian or to 
              a scientist in an "Ask-A-Scientist" service.
In sending a question, students may be asked to provide their first 
              name, grade, school, and state/country; the information requested 
              by these services is used solely for participation in these activities 
              and is neither stored nor sold to third parties.
If the question 
              and corresponding answer is posted on the web site or included in 
              reports (e.g. an FAQ), only the student’s first name, grade, and 
              state/country will appear.
