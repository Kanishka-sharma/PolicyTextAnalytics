Technologies we use
SunTrust and its online advertising and marketing partners may employ various technologies to collect information, including:

Cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on your device.
Cookies provide information that is used for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively and to personalize/customize your online experience.
You can choose to block these cookies as most devices and browsers offer their own privacy settings.
==========
Doing so, however, may result in diminished performance on our site.
Pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other technologies: This technology may be placed on certain pages of our website, applications, emails and other marketing initiatives.
These tags usually work in conjunction with cookies, and allow us to measure the effectiveness of our site and compile statistics about usage and response rates.
==========
Adobe® Flash® objects: Flash objects are data files that can be created on your computer by the sites you visit.
These objects help us recognize you and your device and are vital for online authentication.
==========
For SunTrust web pages running Adobe Flash content, we use Flash objects to determine your browser type and version of Adobe Flash in order for you to view the content.
Deleting cookies does not delete Flash objects.
If you disable Flash objects, you may not be able to access and use parts of SunTrust websites.
Learn more about Flash objects and how to control and disable them at the Adobe website.
==========
Cross-Device Tracking: SunTrust participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, which helps companies build websites, applications and advertisements that seamlessly flow between all your devices (devices could include a desktop, laptop, tablet, phone or smart watch).
The Device Co-op recognizes which of your devices are linked – used by the same person— through use of technology that includes cookies and your IP address (without collecting your personal information).
Visit the Adobe website for more information on cross-device tracking and/or to unlink your devices.

Interacting with SunTrust online
Online advertising on SunTrust websites and applications
SunTrust advertises its products and services on pages within our sites and on mobile applications.
To make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, SunTrust may target and personalize content and advertisements for products and services on our site and within Online Banking (when clients sign on or off to online accounts with their user ID/password).
==========
If you would prefer to not receive personalized banner advertisements, content, and offers on unauthenticated pages (before sign-in), you can opt out (clicking this link will activate the opt-out).
Opting out will not prevent you from receiving banner ads, but the ads you are served will not be personalized.
If you would prefer to not receive a specific advertisement, content or offers on SunTrust authenticated (after signing-in) pages, you can click “No Thanks” to the specific pop-up ad you are being presented.
Note that this will not prevent you from potentially receiving other ads, content or offers for a different product or service.
Also note that simply closing the pop-up message by clicking on the “X” will not register that you do not wish to receive this specific message again.
==========
Online advertising on third-party websites and applications
SunTrust advertises its products and services on websites and applications not affiliated with SunTrust.
The third-party companies we hire to display these ads use their own tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your interest.
Many of our third-party partners have their own privacy policies.
We encourage you to review these policies carefully.
==========
Some of our third-party advertising is interest-based and may use information about your online interests to customize the online ads you see.
SunTrust has adopted the use of the AdChoices Icon (also known as the Advertising Option Icon) for our interest-based advertising (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon).
==========
Anyone receiving an interest-based ad can click on the displayed icon to receive more information.
The AdChoices Icon does not prevent you from receiving advertisements, but allows you to control whether you receive interest-based advertisements and from which companies.
Visit the Digital Advertising Alliance website for more information about the AdChoices Icon and interest-based advertising.
==========
Third-party aggregation services and tools
Aggregation allows you to gather information from many websites and view that information in a consolidated format.
An example of why you might use a third-party aggregation tool is if you wanted a comprehensive view of assets and liabilities held within your financial accounts.
==========
If you provide information about your SunTrust accounts (including your access information) to an aggregation service provider, we will consider that as your having authorized all transactions initiated by that aggregation site.
SunTrust reserves the right to disable aggregation for any account without notice.
If you wish to cancel your third-party aggregation services you should also change your password at suntrust.com.
==========
Social Media
SunTrust provides experiences on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter that enable online sharing and collaboration.
Any content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those platforms.
Please refer to them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.
==========
Given the very public nature of social media, it is critical that we all safeguard confidential financial information.
If you post information on a SunTrust site that we feel should be shielded from public view, we will remove it.
This includes not only specific details about your SunTrust accounts and other private, confidential information (such as your Social Security Number), but details of information relayed in private conversations between you and SunTrust representatives.
Please know that in taking down or editing your posts, we are focusing our experience and best judgment to keep your personal information safe.
==========
Linking to other sites
SunTrust may provide links to non-SunTrust companies, such as credit bureaus or merchants, and will notify you when leaving the SunTrust site.
If you choose to link to websites not controlled by SunTrust, we are not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability of their information.
If you are asked to provide information on one of these sites we urge you to carefully study their privacy policies before sharing.
==========
Protecting your children
SunTrust strictly follows the federal guidelines of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which gives parents control over what type of information is collected online about their children.
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personally identifiable information from children under age 13 on our websites.
==========
We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices of nonaffiliated third-parties that are linked from our websites.

==========
Security
To protect personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with applicable federal and state laws.
