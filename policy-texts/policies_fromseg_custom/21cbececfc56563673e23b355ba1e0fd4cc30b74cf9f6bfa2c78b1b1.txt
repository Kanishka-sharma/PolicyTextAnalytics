Privacy Policy
Driving stronger privacy across the industry is an essential part of the Demandbase strategy.
Demandbase is a Real-time Targeting and Personalization platform for B2B.
Demandbase works by identifying the companies that are visiting a website, and then by making that insight actionable in your existing Marketing and Sales programs and technologies.
Demandbase offers Company-Targeted display advertising, website engagement and conversion modules, and CRM integration for a consistent view of account behavior across our client's digital presence.
The Demandbase platform does this without placing cookies on browser hard drives and without the use of behavioral targeting or any personally identifiable information about a web visitor.
“Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that identifies you personally, including, without limitation, your name, e-mail address, password, login ID and other contact information that you voluntarily submit to us.
Demandbase does not use cookies for ad serving.

Cookies
Demandbase does employ cookies at Demandbase.com in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user.
Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow Demandbase to remember the visitor.
The cookies placed by the Demandbase server are readable only by Demandbase, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer.
==========
All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie.
If a visitor refuses the Demandbase cookie, Demandbase does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences.
You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive.
Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the Site.
Demandbase monitors how a visitor arrives at the Site, but cannot and will not gather information about other third party sites the user has visited.
Demandbase automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser.
In certain sections of the Site, Demandbase may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form.

Demandbase may also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you use certain Demandbase services, through the use of the Site or hypersite web pages, or when you enter promotions or contests offered by Demandbase on and through the Site.
When you visit the Demandbase Websites, we collect information, including PII that you provide, in order to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs.

Account Protection
Your password is the key to your account.
We recommend the use of unique numbers, letters, and special characters in combination and that you not disclose your Demanbase password to anyone.
If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.

Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States.
We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use certain tools (including but not limited to encryption, passwords, and physical security) to protect you personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure.
However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
Therefore, although we take all reasonable steps to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
==========
Phishing
In order to protect yourself from third parties unlawfully seeking your personal information through email that appears to be from Demandbase, you should never provide any personal information directly in response to an email you believe you have received from us.
Rather, you should always close any such email, open your browser, log directly in to the Demandbase Site and change, update or modify and such personal information only using our Site.
In the event that you believe that you have received a request for personal information in an email message that is made to appear that it was sent by us, please inform us immediately.
General
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Site.
All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.
