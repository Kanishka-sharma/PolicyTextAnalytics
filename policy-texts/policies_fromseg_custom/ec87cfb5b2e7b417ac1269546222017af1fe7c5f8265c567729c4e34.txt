INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT ABOUT YOU
Personal Information: This refers to information that can be used to identify a User, such as first and last name, telephone number, email address, mailing address, birth date, profile photo, and account login information (i.e., username and password).
It also includes information that may be uniquely linked to a User as a result of his/her visit to the CK-12 Platform, such as server log file data and session information (which is explained in more detail below).
You may need to provide your personal information in order to access certain areas and features on the CK-12.
Non-Personal Information: This refers to any information that does not identify a User personally.
For example, we may gather demographic and/or other aggregate data about our Users as a group.
==========
Also, we may use online survey and feedback forms to gather opinions, comments, suggestions, etc. about the CK-12 Platform on an anonymous basis from our Users; occasionally, we report quoted feedback from Users, but we do not attribute feedback to individual Users unless we have permission from a User to use his or her name along with the feedback.
We collect and use non-personal information to administer and monitor the CK-12 Platform, to analyze CK-12 Platform traffic and usage patterns and trends, to improve the functionality of the CK-12 Platform, and to enable us to personalize and better Users’ experience on the CK-12 Platform.
When we report information about the Site to our partners and investors, we report non-personal information only.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
We will use your information only for the purposes for which it was collected.
Those purposes include:
• Member Registration (website registration): Certain areas and features on the CK-12 Platform are accessible only to registered Members, such as the FlexBook Platform™.
To register as a Member, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, birth date, and a password.
We collect birth date information for age verification purposes.
If you register as a Member, we will use your personal information for all purposes related to your membership (pursuant to our agreement with you as a member) and your use of the CK-12 Platform as a Member, including, without limitation: providing administrative, maintenance and support services to Member accounts and responding to Member inquiries, requests and complaints.
When registering, you may (optional) provide general information about yourself, such as occupation, professional experience, education, institution/school affiliations, and interests.
==========
If you choose, you may also include a profile photo of yourself.
We use this information pursuant to our legitimate interests in providing you a personalized experience.
Please note that your first name and your general profile (including your profile photo) – but not your last name, email address, birth date, and your login password – will be “public” information, meaning that they will be viewable and accessible by others on the CK-12 Platform.
Also, all User Postings made by you will automatically be linked to your username and profile, so they will be visible to others in connection with your postings.
If you choose to publish or otherwise share with others your personal information (e.g., disclosing your personal information in your User Postings), then others will have access to your personal information.
==========
If you are not located in the EEA and under the age of 13, when you register for the CK-12 Platform, you will be asked to provide your name and your parent’s or teacher’s email address.

When a User registers using a Google, Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft account, we will automatically receive that User’s name, email, gender, and profile photo from Google, Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft (as the case may be).
As above, we will use your personal information for all purposes related to your membership (pursuant to our agreement with you as a member) and your use of the CK-12 Platform as a Member.

We may also use your personal information to send you news, updates, announcements, newsletters, and other CK-12 marketing communications via email.
Certain of these communications will be pursuant to our legitimate interests to keep you informed, while other communications may be pursuant to your consent (if we are required by law to obtain your consent).
You may opt out of our marketing mailing lists at any time.
Once you opt out, we will not reuse your email address unless you rejoin our marketing lists or otherwise opt in to receive electronic communications from us.

• Log Files and Cookies: Our web servers may automatically generate log files that contain data linked to individual Users, such as IP address, browser type, operating system, ISP domain name, referring/exit page, date/time stamp, clickstream data, etc.
Also, the CK-12 Platform may use cookies to collect session information about individual Users’ visits to the CK-12 Platform.
==========
(See Section 7 below for more information about cookies.)
We use log file data and cookie session information internally and to further our interests in operating the CK-12 Platform and generating/analyzing aggregate data about our Users as a group.
