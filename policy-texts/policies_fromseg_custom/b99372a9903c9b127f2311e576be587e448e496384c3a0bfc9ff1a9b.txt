Security
We use the Netscape Secure Commerce Server to protect your billing information.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts information and keeps the data private and confidential between your machine and Southwest Airlines.
This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet.
Look for two security icons, the "s" after "http" in the address line and the lock in the top menu bar and bottom status bar of your browser in Netscape (or in the bottom status bar only in Internet Explorer).

Southwest Airlines requires our Preferred Partners to ensure safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of the information we share.
We are careful in our selection of these Partners to ensure your privacy and the value of their offers.
If you wish to be excluded from special offers, please call Rapid Rewards Customer Service (800) 445-5764 or write to Rapid Rewards, PO Box 36657, Dallas, Texas  75235-1657.
We require the same safeguards for the information received over the Internet as we do for Customer information received by telephone and mail.
