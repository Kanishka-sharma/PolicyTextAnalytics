This document describes Cluep's privacy practices as they pertain to our corporate website and any customer extranet (the "Site") and our real time mobile advertising service (the "Service") and how we collect and use consumer data.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies and websites not under the control of Cluep or to individuals that Cluep does not employ or manage.At Cluep, we invest great efforts in ensuring that our products and services adequately address legislative and regulatory requirements.
Data protection and overall client trust in Cluep’s services continues to be of the highest importance to us.How does our website collect and use cookies?We use Google Analytics to capture website usage and we utilize this data to help ensure that we deliver the best user experience.
We also use a third party font distributor called Adobe Typekit which collects information about the users of the website for their own purposes.You can read more about their privacy policy at:What information is collected by Cluep?During the integration phase of Cluep’s technology with a publisher, advertising exchange and social media platform, the Cluep partner may specify the type of personal data that will be shared with Cluep via the integrations.
Most partners enable Cluep to process information such as the following:Internet Protocol (IP) addressesAdvertising IDPrecise (GPS) location data, if permitted by the appDevice ID and typeIn connection with our Technology, Cluep captures keywords from public messages you may send via social media platforms.
Social media platforms generally have tools to help you choose which of your messages are public and which are private.In order to offer the Technology, Cluep compiles publicly available pseudonymous information about consumer use of social media.
If you send a tweet or share an article you read via sharing tool, or post to a social media platform, we may collect some information about that Tweet, share or post and leverage technologies like cookies, tags, Apple's IFA and AndroidID for collecting and identifying data to tailor ads.
==========
We may also collect data through third parties.Cluep stores anonymized user data for ad targeting, internal reporting, analysis and to provide its services, and may save such data for longer period for invoicing, reporting, discrepancy reasons and to prevent fraud, but in any case, for no longer than 60 days after the completion of a client program.Do Not Sell My InformationYou may opt-out of receiving mobile advertisements targeted by Cluep by clicking here.User ConsentCluep encourages social media platforms, advertising exchanges and publishers to create their own consent dialogue to present to users on their apps or sites.
Cluep also provides the ability to incorporate ad choices into its advertising which offers users the ability to opt-out.
==========
A publisher who obtains consent directly from users may benefit from the following:Better user experience – Present users with a single message, on the screen and at time of your choosing, thereby avoiding multiple ‘opt-in’ messages presented on behalf of different ad vendors.Personal outreach – Engage users with a personal, tailored message that matches the tone of the app and its audience.
The more personal the outreach, the better the chances of obtaining consent.Improved monetization – Users are more likely to provide consent if the request comes from the app developer than from an unfamiliar company such as an ad vendor.Enhanced control over data – With direct user consent, a publisher will be the owner of their users’ data.
The alternative of counting on an ad vendor’s consent mechanism means that when a publisher decides to switch to another ad vendor that is a controller or introduce its own consent dialog, it may need to present all users with a new consent message.Ensuring GDPR compliance with CluepCluep brings value to advertisers by adhering to GDPR.
==========
In general, Cluep processes personal data on behalf of the controller (e.g. the publisher, advertising exchange and social media platform).
It is the duty of the controller to only use processors that are GDPR compliant.Cluep implemented internal processes to anonymize user data in a way that still makes it useful for advertisers, while ensuring that user identity is protected.
For example, whenever the updated SDK’s of Cluep advertising exchange partners receive an indication that a user declined consent, it automatically anonymizes the GPS coordinate data, Device ID and/or IP addresses before passing the ad request to Cluep programmatically for ad delivery, to ensure that no personal information is processed.
==========
In addition, Cluep partner advertising exchanges will flag to Cluep that the user did not provide the consent required under GDPR and does not wish to be served with targeted ads on the app or site.To ensure our compliance with GDPR, Cluep partner advertising exchanges have updated their OpenRTB integrations in accordance to IAB’s instructions, as follows:They will flag whether a user falls within the European Economic Area (EEA) - and thus is subject to GDPR - via the “Regs” object (new field: regs.ext.gdpr, 0=FALSE 1=TRUE)If a user falls within EEA, they will flag whether he/she gave or declined consent to receive targeted ads, via the “User” object (new field: user.ext.consent, 0=FALSE 1=TRUE) The SDK’s of Cluep partner advertising exchanges have been updated prior to May 25, 2018.
