The Smithsonian is concerned about protecting children's privacy.
We do not collect personally identifiable information from children.
There are some sites within the Smithsonian’s network of Websites where children may post messages or provide feedback, but children are discouraged from providing personal information.
If a visitor known to be a child (under the age of 13) sends an email to the Smithsonian, we will only use it to respond to the writer and not to create profiles or otherwise retain the information.
We take reasonable precautions to ensure that all credit card transactions that occur on the web site are secure.
When you submit your credit card for any purchase at the Smithsonian’s network of Web sites, that transaction is encrypted using “Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) encryption to prevent your credit card information from being seen as it travels over the Internet to our servers.
We monitor network traffic to ensure that our site remains available to all users and to identify unauthorized attempts to access, upload or change information or otherwise cause damage.
Unauthorized access is prohibited and punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
==========
Within the Smithsonian’s Website there are links to non-Smithsonian websites.
When you link to third party websites, you leave our Website and no longer will be subject to our privacy policy.
The Smithsonian is not responsible for the privacy practices nor the content of non-Smithsonian websites, and such link is not intended to be an endorsement of the non-Smithsonian website or its content.
The Smithsonian is a large organization with many people sharing responsibility for the content of our Website.
