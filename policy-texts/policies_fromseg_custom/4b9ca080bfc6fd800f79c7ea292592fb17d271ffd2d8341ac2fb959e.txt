Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “pixel tags,” “1×1 GIFs,” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and email messages.
Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon.
Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.
==========
The Websites may contain integration with social networks and other platforms.
For example, the Websites may contain buttons that direct users to our social networking pages (such as Facebook or Twitter) or enabling you to “like” or “share” the Websites’ content to other online services.
If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information via the Websites to a third-party website or other online service, that information may be publicly displayed and the third-party website may have access to information about you and your use of our Websites.
==========
In addition, the Websites may have links to third party websites.

We are not responsible for the privacy or business practices of any third party.
We may receive information about you from third parties.
==========

In addition, we may receive information if you opt-in to receive information from us when on a third party website, app or service.
We may combine the information we receive from these other sources with information we collect through the Websites.
In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
