What we don’t know about your users (and we will never know)
Since we use data protection-friendly technology and a sophisticated anonymisation system: We do not know their name, lastname.
We do not know their postal address, email.
We don’t make a connection to their users as an individual.
What do we know about a user
Every time a user browse on a website or an app enabled with Myntelligence cookie-less technology, a statistical prediction regarding users gender and age is calculated.
Obviously it’s a guess and if our algorithm are good enough and we have previously seen the user enough times, then our prediction should be correct.
This is possible through a number of sophisticated analysis that is based on machine learning algorithms.
In a nutshell, we associate to the same predictive qualification past behavior of the users and compares it with other group of users to understand where similarities are.
This general information regarding user groups behavior is used by Myntelligence across its clients and become the “ Shared Data” asset, but again, we don’t know who the user is.
==========
For the users this is completely safe.
The worst thing that can happen to a user is that he or she may start watching ads that most likely match their interest.
.
==========
An happy problem!
What do we do with the data analyzed?
We use the data collected for audience rating and analysis purposes.
The data collected are not associated with any PII information whatsoever.
We store the data only to increase precision in audience qualification.
The more data we analyze, the more precise the user qualification/prediction results and, as benefit, the chances the users sees more in-target ad and better content is higher.
