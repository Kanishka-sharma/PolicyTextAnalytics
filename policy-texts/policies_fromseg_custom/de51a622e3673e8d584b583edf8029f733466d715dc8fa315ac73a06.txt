Process
Introduction and General Philosophy
This page outlines the process by which Meraki coordinates and delivers its technical support responses to its customers.
All processes outlined throughout this page apply to all Meraki products.
Meraki's general philosophy is to:
Provide the highest quality and fastest possible support directly to Meraki customers.
Deliver customer satisfaction; internally, the Meraki support team is evaluated on their customer satisfaction metrics and are responsible for delivering consistent measured customer satisfaction.
Ensure Meraki authorized resellers are properly supported during field installations and troubleshooting activities, assuming the support request is in regards to a currently licensed Meraki product.
Effectively track and coordinate customer interactions and support activities.
==========
Meraki Support Paradigm
All customers have an explicit support owner at all times.
Normally this is a Meraki support team member; however, during pre-sales product it could be a Meraki Systems Engineer, VAR, or other field sales resource.
All legitimate support requests are the responsibility of Meraki Support until closure, unless there is explicit agreement between Meraki Support and the customer to transfer management of the case to another party.
Unless discussed and agreed to by Meraki Support, all customer support communication flows through the Meraki Support Team.
This ensures:
Proper case management and recording
Proper follow up is achieved throughout case lifecycle
Customer satisfaction is the responsibility of the Meraki Support Team.
If a case is reassigned to another Meraki resource, or a Meraki authorized reseller, Meraki reserves the right to expect timely response from that party or Merkai Support may to intervene to ensure customer satisfaction.

A case may be escalated based on any of the following criteria:

Product End-of-Life (EOL) Policy
Meraki, Inc. may find it necessary to discontinue products for a number of reasons, including product line enhancements, market demands, technology innovation or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer products.
We have set our end-of-life policy to help customers better manage their product end-of-life transition.
When a product reaches EOL, Meraki is committed to communicating important milestones throughout the EOL period.
These notifications shall include the initial EOL notification, End of Sale (EOS) announcement and End of Support (EOST) dates, as well as other key information pertaining to Meraki, Inc. products.
Any products being discontinued will be announced as End of Sale and identified on the Meraki website up to six months prior to the discontinuation and end of sale date also known as the last order date.
On the end of sale date, discontinued products are removed from the price list and are no longer available for purchase.
Meraki typically provides support for a given product for a period of five (5) years after the End of Sale date.
If the discontinued product is not available for replacement or repair of an in-warranty return, Meraki reserves the right to replace the discontinued product with functionally equivalent hardware and transfer the remaining license term from the replaced product to the replacement hardware.
