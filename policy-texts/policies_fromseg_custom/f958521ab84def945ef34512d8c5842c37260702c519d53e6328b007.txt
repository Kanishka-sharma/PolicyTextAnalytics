Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet
Protecting children’s privacy is important to us.
For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information on our Web Site from those we actually know are under the age of 13, nor is any part of our Web Site targeted to attract anyone under 13.
We request that all visitors to our Web Site who are under 13 not disclose or provide any personally identifiable information.
If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our records.
Data Security
We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information that we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as installing electronic security systems that guard against unauthorized access.
However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk.
