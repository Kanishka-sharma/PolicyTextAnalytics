Zillow also allows consumers to request that Lenders pre-approve them for home loans.
When consumers submit the required information and request pre-approval from a participating Lender, Lenders may elect to respond based on parameters established by the Lender.
Qualification for pre-approval does not constitute an offer to lend, a commitment for a loan, or a guarantee of specific rates or terms.
==========
If you, as a consumer, choose to contact a Lender through Zillow Mortgage Marketplace by filling out a contact request or other request form on Zillow, you authorize Zillow to provide your name and contact information  and other identifying information you provide to the Lender you choose, along with your quote or pre-approval request.
