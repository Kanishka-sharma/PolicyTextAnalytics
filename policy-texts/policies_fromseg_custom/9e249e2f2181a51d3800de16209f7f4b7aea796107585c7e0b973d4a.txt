Privacy Policy

This
Privacy Policy (policy) describes how we maintain and treat your
personal information and both our and you rights to personal
information you provide to us or that we obtain in connection with our
Site.
At BBC Worldwide, we are committed to
protecting your privacy rights.
While no data transmission over the
Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue
to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your
personal information.
We will not share your personal information with
any unaffiliated third party without your prior consent.
==========
How we collect and use information


When we use the term “personal information“
we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last
name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number,
instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL,
date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would
allow someone to identify you or contact you.
Personal information also
includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses
and your transactions or relationship with us, if you have been a
customer or you have provided this type of information to any of the BBC Worldwide companies or affiliates.
We
collect personal information on our customers in various ways,
including: magazine subscriptions; orders for products by telephone,
post, the internet or e-mail; readers’ offers; competition entry forms;
or feedback, research or request forms.
You will have the right to
opt-out (unsubscribe) of receiving marketing e-mails or messages from
us at any time by responding to that e-mail and using the “unsubscribe”
or opt-out procedure included in that communication.
From time to time, we may use your personal details for these main purposes:


 to meet product orders or requests for services or information; to process payments; and to keep our records up-to-date; 
 to tell you by telephone, mail or e-mail about special offers and current or new products that you may be interested in; 
 to enable other people or businesses to carry out our work on our behalf; 
 where you have given us your permission, to pass your information to
	selected organisations to allow them to tell you about their special
	offers or products and services that may be of interest to you; and 
 to manage our promotions and competitions and contact the winners.
==========
We
may group together statistical information to understand more about our
customers in order to improve our range of products and services and
help manage our relationships with advertisers.
When this is done, we
only provide anonymous information and do not disclose personal
information about any individuals.
To fulfill some of the above processes we may have to pass your information to other parts of the BBC
group of companies inside and outside the United States and/or the
European Union.
==========
They will, of course, treat your information with the
same respect that we do.
How we apply our policy


In order to put our policy into practice, we follow seven guidelines:


 We will ensure our systems are reasonably secure to protect your personal information from misuse; 
 We will respect your privacy rights in the way that we contact you, whether by mail, telephone, e-mail or text message; 
 We will not hold your personal information for longer than is necessary for our purposes; 
 We will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other
	people or businesses unless we have your consent.
With your consent, we
	will only share your information with third parties we believe are
	reputable and trustworthy.
We will comply promptly with any instructions from you to update your information; 
 We will comply with lawful requests to disclose personal information to certain authorities (e.g., the police); 
 We may monitor and record any telephone calls to ensure we follow your instructions correctly and to improve our service.
We will provide necessary personal information to law enforcement and
	other government officials if we know, suspect or have reason to
	believe you are violating any laws or regulations, the rights of any
	other party or our Website Terms.

If
you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian’s permission

Cookies


Where
advertisements appear on this website, we use a third-party advertising
company to serve those ads.
That company may use information (not
including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about
your visit to this website in order to provide advertisements about
goods and services that may be of interest to you.
In the course of
serving advertisements or otherwise in connection with your use of our
Site, we or our third-party advertiser may place a small bit of
information on your computer commonly referred to as a “cookie.”
==========
A
cookie is a text file which identifies your computer to our server.

computer used.
We will not collect and store personal information using
the cookie, although we may use a cookie to monitor your visit and
ensure that you are presented with appropriate information.
If you
wish, you can prevent acceptance of cookies by your internet browser,
although this will impair your use of our Site.

The
use of technology by third parties is within their control and not ours
and even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not
control them or their policies and practices regarding your personal
information.
This policy does not cover any use of personal information
that a third party advertiser or ad server or any other party may
collect or obtain from you.

operators, which may differ from our policy.

It
is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and
accurate information and to keep the personal information that you
provide to us up to date.
We cannot and will not be
responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not

in violation of the Website Terms and parents (including legal
guardians) who wish to terminate such child’s membership must send us
an e-mail and provide us with your child’s User ID and request to
terminate your child’s account and registration.
We will not allow
direct access to a user’s account and personal information by any
person without the user’s User ID.
==========
If a parent does not have his or her
child’s User ID, the parent will be required to send an e-mail to us
that includes the parent’s name, address, telephone and e-mail address,
in addition to the child’s name and e-mail address as registered on the

address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or
her child’s account and registration.
The parent must then confirm by
sending a reply e-mail to the designated return address.
We will then
terminate the child’s account but will notify the child of the
termination request via e-mail and will identify the name, address and
e-mail address of the person making the request.
==========
Changes to this policy


We may change this policy at any time in our sole discretion, including the need to keep up to date with changes in legislation.
Questions About Your Rights


Your California Privacy Rights


If
you are a resident of the State of California, under the California
Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting
business in California a list of all third parties to which the company
has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct
marketing purposes.
Alternatively, the law provides that if the company
has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may
sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in choice for
use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers
or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may
instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure
choice options.
The Site qualifies for the alternative
option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with
details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your
personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.
Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the
third parties that received your personal information for marketing
purposes during the preceding year.
If you are a California
resident and request information about how to exercise your third party
disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address
with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent
(e-mail or postal mail).
Send an e-mail to the privacy administrator at
vernon.chu@bbc.com, or you may contact us via regular mail at: 


General Counsel, Business and Legal Affairs, BBC Worldwide Americas, Inc., 747 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017


All
requests sent via regular mail must be labelled “Your California
Privacy Rights” on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the
actual request.
==========
For all requests, please include your name,
street address, city, state, and zip code.
(Your street address is
optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail.
Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.)
We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.
We are not responsible for notices that are not labelled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
General


For
non-California residents and all other users, if you have questions
about our privacy policy or if you do not understand how we collect,
maintain, use or share your personal information, you may contact Us
