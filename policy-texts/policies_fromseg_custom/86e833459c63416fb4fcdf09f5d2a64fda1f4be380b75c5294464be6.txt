Third party advertising cookies


Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third 
  parties.
Some of these third parties generate their own cookies to track how 
  many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of 
  third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more 
  than once.
==========
These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can 
  only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with 
  advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.
Some of the 
  information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other 
  anonymous information for statistical purposes.
The third party companies 
  that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies 
  but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be 
  served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use 
  statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided 
  to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users 
  of the website).
If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or 
  providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going 
  to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no 
  thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your 
  machine.

  use, each of which have instructions on how to do this:
