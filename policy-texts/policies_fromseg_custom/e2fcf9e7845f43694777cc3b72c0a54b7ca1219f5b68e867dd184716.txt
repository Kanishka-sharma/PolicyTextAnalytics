What personally identifiable information of yours Newegg.com collects.
The organization collecting the information.
How the information is used.
With whom the information may be shared.
What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of
								the information.

==========
Information Collection and Use
						Newegg.com ("Us" or "We") is the sole owner of information collected on this site
						to purchase most products and services from Newegg.com (refer to the next paragraph
						for the limited exceptions to this).
We will not sell, share, or rent this information
						to any third parties, except as outlined in this policy.
We collect information
						from our customers to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information,
						such as order confirmations, order status updates, and to provide you with information
						on products and services that are available from us or parties associated with us.
We may also use such information to better understand the shopping experiences of
						you individually or in conjunction with a group of our customers.
Information collected
						includes your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail
						address, and payment information such as your credit card number.
==========
We also require
						you to submit a username and password of your choice for your future access to your
						account information.
To safeguard that your user name and password remain confidential,
						DO NOT share this information with anyone.
==========
If you elect to receive our newsletter,
						surveys, or special promotions, your contact information will be used for the delivery
						of these items.
However, if you elect not to receive newsletters, surveys, or special
						promotions, we may still periodically send other transactional communications to
						you that contain customer relationship information.
This includes, for example,
						informational emails regarding changes in our policies, changes in our methods of
						conducting business, or requesting that you review the information we have on file
						for you or the options that you have previously selected regarding your transactions
						with us.
==========
We may also gather or receive information on you from third party sources, such
						as marketing databases made available for commercial purchase.
Our use of such information
						will comply with applicable law, the limitations imposed by the third party on us
						in connection with our receipt of such information from such third party sources,
						but not necessarily this privacy statement.
For certain services, Newegg.com has agreements with select third party business
						partners in order to provide our customers with additional services that we otherwise
						do not offer.
==========
Such services include wireless communication services.
In these cases,
						we collect certain information from you to send to the third party service provider
						in order to activate or upgrade your account with the service provider.
We do not
						provide any of your information to the third party service provider unless you first
						consent.
Any information that we provide to the third party service provider with
						your consent is owned by that service provider, and it may use your information
						for service approval, activation, upgrade and for other purposes that it requires.
You should consult the privacy policies of the respective third party service providers,
						since this Newegg.com Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your information
						in these limited circumstances.
==========
In addition, from time to time we may provide you with chances to enter into sweepstakes
						or contests.
We conduct these sweepstakes and contests in partnership with select
						third parties.
==========
When you enter, we collect certain personal information from you,
						and as a condition of entry, you typically must agree to allow us to share your
						information with the third party in order to allow the third party to manage the
						prize fulfillment process on our behalf.
Otherwise, we do not provide your information
						to the third party.
==========
Registration
						In order to process your orders placed on this website, you must first complete
						the registration form.
During registration, you will be required to provide your
						contact information, which includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number
						and street address.
This information is used to provide you with important Newegg.com
						services such as automated order status updates via e-mail.
==========
Order
						Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process
						orders.
During the order process, you will have to provide financial information
						such as your credit card number, expiration date, money order, wire transfer or
						check information.
==========
This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill
						your order.
If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information
						to get in touch with you.
To properly process your credit card information, we must
						share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for authorization
						and approval.
==========
This process is protected by an enhanced security system.
See the
						Security section below for more details on security measures and procedures.
==========
We
						do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties, except
						those specified in the Sharing section of this policy.
Cookies
						We customize certain Web page content based upon your browser type and other information
						provided by our cookie.
==========
If you choose to reject the cookie, you can still browse
						our store but will be unable to use the shopping cart to buy merchandise.
The Newegg.com
						shopping cart cannot function without cookies enabled so that the necessary information
						to process your order is retained.
If you disable cookies, Newegg.com will be unable
						to accept your online order.
==========
We will not share any personally identifiable information
						provided by this cookie with any third party.
We will, however, link data stored
						in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submitted while on our
						site.
This allows us to personalize your shopping experience and discern user preferences
						to evoke subconscious feelings of familiarity and assurance.
==========
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.
We have
						no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Newegg.com only and does not
						cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
==========
Log Files
						We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement,
						and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We do not link IP addresses
						to personally identifiable information, and we do not distribute or share IP information
						with any third parties.
Sharing
						We may employ third party companies to perform functions on our behalf.
These functions
						may include order fulfillment, package delivery, marketing assistance, postal and
						e-mail delivery, customer service, data analysis, and credit processing.
The third
						parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your personal information
						and may not use it for other purposes.
Among such third parties are the three referenced
						immediately below.

						Also, as set forth above in the "Information Collection and Use" section, for certain
						services Newegg.com has agreements with select third party business partners in
						order to provide our customers with additional services that we otherwise do not
						offer.
Such services include wireless communication services and sweepstakes and
						contests.
==========
In these cases, and only with your advance consent, we will share information
						collected from you with the third party service provider in order to allow the service
						provider to activate or upgrade your account or in order to manage the prize fulfillment
						process.
For the wireless services, the third party service providers' respective
						privacy policies, and not this Newegg.com Privacy Policy, will apply to their handling
						of the information shared in these circumstances.
In addition, we may frame or mask another web site so that the look, feel and interface
						simulate the experience of browsing a genuine Newegg.com web page.
==========
Care and discretion
						is exercised when evaluating third party sites.
We only brand third party sites
						if their organization applies security and privacy practices which we view are reasonably
						consistent, where appropriate, to our own commitment to safe online shopping.
==========
As our business continues to evolve, we may acquire or sell business units or subsidiaries.
Customer information is one of the business assets that would be transferred in
						these types of transactions.
In such a situation, your personally identifiable information
						would only be used in a manner consistent with our pre-existing Privacy Notice.
==========
Certain manufacturers of products and providers of services sold through Newegg.com may 
						require or request for us to provide to them with your personal information, including for 
						instance, (a) your name and contact information, (b) information about the particular products 
						or services of theirs which you purchased, (c) as well as the prices paid for the purchase of 
						those products or services, for purposes including (i) validating or recording a warranty that 
						applies to your purchase, (ii) providing a discount or credit to you or to Newegg.com, (iii) to 
						provide you with additional information, or (iv) to better understand customer needs and desires.
While we endeavor to limit such manufacturers' and providers' use of the information, such limits 
						vary and so you should not assume that any particular limitation exists.
If you have a concern 
						about a particular manufacturer or provider receiving such information, please review the items 
						you are considering purchasing and remove them from your order.
If you do not wish to have your 
						information shared with such manufacturers or providers, please contact webmaster@newegg.com.
==========
Be aware that when you volunteer information or create a public profile in the course
						of your participation in our community features such as forums, user opinions and
						reviews, chat rooms, photo sharing or other forms of public communication and interaction,
						you are also agreeing to allow certain aspects of your personally identifiable information
						to be made public.
This includes your screen name, any address or personal information
						or images that you add to your signature or otherwise post to the public, and any
						content of any such post.
Finally, if you have elected to allow us to share your personally identifiable information
						at the time that you registered with us or provided us the information, or through
						a subsequent affirmative election through our website, we may later disclose such
						information to others in compliance with your election and this privacy statement.
==========
Third Party Service Providers Disclosure
						We use PayPal to facilitate our order and payment processing.
When you place an
						order, you may be automatically transferred to PayPal's web site.

						that their privacy policy governs the use and collection of your personally identifiable
						information and is shared with us to fulfill the order.
