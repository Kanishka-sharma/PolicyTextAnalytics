Personally Identifiable Information
Registration for our Web sites
Anyone can view the Site, but a free registration process is required to access the full range of information and services we offer.
TheLedger.com requires that you supply a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex, household income to register.
By using TheLedger.com, you are agreeing to the terms of our Member Agreement).
==========
Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers
On occasion, The Lakeland Ledger collects personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers.
If this information is to be shared with a third party other than The Lakeland Ledger, we will notify you at the time of collection.
If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
The Lakeland Ledger may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys.
Data may be collected on our Web sites, on the phone or through the mail.
The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
==========
Mobile Messaging Service
We may elect to offer certain text messaging services (the “SMS Service”).
We use the information collected from your interaction with the SMS Service solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service.
The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed, except as required by law.
==========
We will not use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent.
Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage: their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.
The Lakeland Ledger collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and The Lakeland Ledger.
When you send a text message to The Lakeland Ledger or via The Lakeland Ledger, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction.
The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services.
The Lakeland Ledger uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service.
==========
Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology
Cookies and Other Technologies
As is standard practice on many Web sites, The Lakeland Ledger uses “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there.
Users who do not accept cookies from the domain "TheLedger.com" cannot access most areas of our sites.
We reserve the right to place a The Lakeland Ledger Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.
For detailed information about our use of cookies, see the Frequently Asked Questions area of our Member Center.
==========
Yahoo! is an ad network partner that displays ads on NYTRMG sites.
To improve your ad experience on NYTRMG sites and elsewhere on the Internet, we may send non-personal information to Yahoo! based on your browser's activities, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interests, so that the advertising you see is relevant to you.
Yahoo! also may use information regarding its own users to select which ads to display.
Learn more about Yahoo!'s ad practices, including how to opt out of using anonymous information to select which ads to show you.
==========
NYTRMG, of which we are a part, is currently using Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our Web site and constantly improve its quality.
All data collected by Omniture on behalf of TheLedger.com is owned and used by The Lakeland Ledger or NYTRMG.
The Lakeland Ledger reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.
Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers.
For more information about Omniture's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to www.omniture.com/policy.html
We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Advertisers on TheLedger.com may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web site, and in these instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags/pixel tags) to better manage advertising on our site.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users.
For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service.
The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Please keep in mind, we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser.
==========
IP Addresses
The Lakeland Ledger logs IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.
We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site.

Banner Advertising
We may use behavioral, demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent.

We will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.
User Generated Content (Message Boards, Forums, Reader Reviews and Chats)
We offer message boards for readers in a number of areas throughout our Web sites.
==========
The message boards are currently hosted and managed by Grouppee, a third party vendor.
Any information you disclose when posting to a message board, along with your message board screen name or ID, becomes public and may be used by The Lakeland Ledger for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.
