Our staff, contractors and others who help us operate 
        our web sites follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices 
        for online activities of Snowball.com, Inc.
This Privacy Policy applies to the web sites, or networks, 
        owned by Snowball.com, Inc. ("Snowball.com") including 
        snowball.com, IGN.com, ChickClick (including chickshops.com), PowerStudents.com,

        Razzberry.com, ScoopsWrestling.com, GameSages.com, iWrestling.com and CyberSlam.com.
We refer to these web sites as the "Snowball.com Sites."
While Snowball.com Sites each 
        offer a different combination of services and tools from one site 
        to another, this policy states Snowball.com’s company-wide Privacy 
        Policy with regard to data-collection practices.
By registering as a member of a Snowball.com Site, you 
        agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy 
        may change over time as discussed below.
OVERVIEW OF OUR POLICY

The security of personal information is a high priority 
        at Snowball.com.
==========
We maintain these web sites and all associated 
        data with technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect 
        against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification 
        and improper disclosure.
No computer system or information can ever 
        be fully protected against every possible hazard.
But Snowball.com 
        is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls 
        to protect our web sites and their information against foreseeable 
        hazards.
The information you provide helps us, and our third-party 
        service providers, make the Snowball.com Sites more fun and useful 
        for you.
==========
It also enables us to give you updates about our services.
When you become a registered member of one of our sites, you may receive 
        updates about our services from Snowball.com and our third-party service 
        providers.
Users should not receive any email or postal mail from 
        any other parties as a result of signing up to become a member of 
        a Snowball.com Site unless the user has expressly "opted-in" 
        to receiving such email.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose 
        personal information in public areas of a Snowball.com Site, such 
        as the member home pages (e.g. "ChickPages") and message 
        boards, your information can be viewed and possibly used by others.
We advise users not to disclose information that can be used to contact 
        the user ("Personally Identifiable information") that they 
        do not wish for others to obtain, such as full name, home address, 
        or phone number.
==========
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY.
This Privacy Policy will always be available to users on this page 
        for you to read.
We will update this privacy and fair information 
        practices policy to reflect new features, services and options, as 
        well as any other changes with regard to the use of personal information.
Users will be notified by a notice on the home pages of the Snowball.com 
        Sites of any significant update to our Privacy Policy.
The new terms 
        of the Privacy Policy will take effect thirty (30) days from the posting 
        of the updated policy.
By registering as a member of a Snowball.com 
        Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our 
        policy may change over time.
Continued use of the Snowball.com Sites 
        or other Snowball.com services will signify that you agree to these 
        changes.
==========

        Snowball.com Sites will prohibit registration by and will not knowingly 
        collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.

INFORMATION COLLECTION ANDUSE.
Below are more details about the information the Snowball.com 
        Sites gather from you and how we use it.
==========
A. 	Email Newsletters.
Several Snowball.com 
        Sites offer email newsletters.
Please note that after April 
        20, 2000, only registered users will be able to receive newsletters.
In signing up to receive one of our newsletters, we currently ask 
        only for your email address.
You can use a Snowball.com Site email 
        account or an account that you may have with another service provider.
We will use your email address only to send you the newsletter(s)
that you signed up for.
As a policy, we do not rent, 
        sell, or in any way share our newsletter subscriber lists to third 
        parties but we may send notices to the lists on behalf of third parties 
        and our newsletters may contain 
        advertisements from Snowball.com sponsors or advertisers.
If you want 
        to update your email address or stop receiving our newsletter, follow 
        the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any newsletter we send 
        you or contact us at comments@snowball.com.
==========
B.	Membership Information.
When you register 
        for membership on one of our sites, we ask for information about you 
        and your interests.
We do this so we can better understand what you 
        like and tailor the site to suit you better.
==========
At a minimum, we require 
        your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code.
The more 
        information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site and promotions 
        to your interests.
Service Providers.
We also offer our 
                  members other services provided by third parties such as free 
                  email and free voicemail, among others.
When you register for 
                  membership on a Snowball.com Site, you are automatically registered 
                  to receive the free services we offer and some of your Personally 
                  Identifiable Information may be transferred from Snowball.com 
                  to those third-party service providers.
By becoming a member, 
                  you authorize us and our third-party service providers to send 
                  you email updates and information about promotions offered by 
                  Snowball.com, the service providers and our advertisers.
We 
                  take care to require that our third-party service providers 
                  only use our member’s data as necessary to provide the 
                  particular service and to give you updates on that service provider’s 
                  products and services.
In addition, we do not allow our advertisers 
                  to use our member list to send email directly to our members.
==========
Co-registration with Other Sites.
As 
                  a member, we offer you the ability to co-register with select 
                  third-party partner sites.
In some instances where Snowball.com 
                  provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow 
                  you to opt-out of their membership.
==========
If you choose to co-register 
                  with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you 
                  are automatically registered as a member of their select web 
                  sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is transferred 
                  to those organizations.
As a result, you may
receive information from one of these web sites 
                  as any of their members would.
We advise you to review their 
                  privacy and data collection policies for further information.
==========
C.	Email Updates to Members.
The Snowball.com 
        Sites may send service email announcements to existing registered 
        users who have elected to receive updates announcing special offers 
        and new features.
These email updates will not be sent more than six 
        times a year.
If you want to update your email address or stop receiving 
        our email service announcements, please follow the procedures to unsubscribe 
        at the bottom of any newsletter we send you or contact us at comments@snowball.com.
==========
D.	Promotions.
We may ask you for Personally 
        Identifiable Information at other times, including, but not limited 
        to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by 
        a third party.
If you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions 
        of this nature, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information 
        with the third party so they can contact you.
The third party may 
        use that information to send you advertisements or other notices, 
        and it is possible that your information may be shared with others.
==========
E.	Surveys and User Research.
Snowball.com 
        conducts email and web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well 
        as instant polls, to gather information about our audience.
It is 
        important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is entirely 
        optional.
==========
You have no obligation to respond to them.
We share only 
        the aggregate results of these surveys, not individual data, with 
        our advertisers and partners to help them better understand our services 
        and monitor the reach of their advertising on our service.
We also 
        store some of the information that our users provide in these surveys 
        to help us understand your interests and to make the site more useful 
        for you.
==========
F.	Use of Cookies.
On the Internet, a "cookie" 
        is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a 
        user's computer for record-keeping purposes.
The use of cookies is 
        common on the Internet.
The process we use to serve advertisements 
        and to track use of our site involves cookies.
Cookies help us and 
        our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and 
        placement of advertisements.
Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate, 
        or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings.
==========
This aids us in producing content that best meets our users’ 
        preferences.
In order to 
        implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well.
We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site 
        you like best.
We may use that information to display advertisements 
        that we think will be of particular interest to you.
You may configure 
        your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality 
        of the Snowball.com Sites.
To find out more about changing your browser 
        to reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page [http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/].

        information does not identify you individually.
==========
I.	Legal Authorities.
The Snowball.com Sites may also disclose 
        Personally Identifiable Information in cases when we have reason to 
        believe that it is necessary to identify someone who may be violating 
        Snowball.com’s Member Terms of Service 
        or may be causing injury to Snowball.com’s rights or property, 
        other users, or anyone else.

        Identifiable Information of our users to government authorities at our

        of user data very seriously and to that end provide extra assurances
