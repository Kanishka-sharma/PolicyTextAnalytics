Privacy Statement
 
Our Commitment and Philosophy

MORPACE International, Inc., a professional market research and consulting firm,
adheres to guidelines in protecting respondent confidentiality.
We are committed to maintaining
the privacy of our online communities.
==========
Your identity and the replies you give to various surveys
are completely confidential.
All research reports contain only aggregated, not individual,
information about the panel.
In our long history, we have never violated our sacred trust to our
respondents; the answers provided by respondents have remained anonymous.
==========
We maintain that
tradition by fiercely guarding your privacy.
We never release individual information unless
the individual expressly agrees to such disclosure.
In addition, we do not "spam" or send
unsolicited commercial emails.
Our panel is exclusively "opt-in."
If you feel that MORPACE International, Inc. is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact:

Information We Collect
To become a member of our panel, we ask that you
fill out a registration form.
This registration will ask you to provide us with some personal
and general consumer information.
==========
We ask for your email address so that we can send you
invitations to participate in surveys and to notify you of sweepstakes winnings.
We ask
you to provide other personal information, such as name, address, birth date, gender, ethnicity,
marital status, education, income, and household fleet of vehicles.
This information is used
to qualify you for particular research projects.
We ask for your birth date to verify your age,
which is a requirement by federal law; we are not allowed to contact persons under the age of 13 without parental consent.
==========
Information We Use
The information that we gather about our panel
members is for research purposes only.
The information is aggregated and analyzed in reports
for our clients.
Your opinions will help in developing and designing future products that
better meet the needs of consumers like you.
==========
We will never share or disclose information that identifies you to clients, partners,
or to any third parties without your consent.
We will never disclose your email address to
anyone unless you give us permission to do so.
==========
The Use Of Cookies
In order to register as a panel member, or
update your panel member information, you must have your browser configured to allow the use of
cookies.
You do not have to have your browser configured to allow cookies in order to take a survey,
however.
Our use of cookies is very limited.
We do not actually store any cookies on your hard drive.
==========
We only use a type of cookie referred to as a "memory cookie."
These are cookies that your browser
temporarily stores in your computer's memory while the browser is running.
When you close your
browser, these cookies are discarded and are no longer accessible.
The information we store in
these cookies cannot be accessed by other web sites you might visit from your browser.
Also, the
information we store in these cookies does not contain passwords or any personal information such as
your name or email address.
==========
Security
We take every precaution to protect your information.
When you submit sensitive information on our site, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration form asks you to enter information, the information you provide is encrypted
and is protected with the most widely used encryption software in the industry:  SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our registration page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to the
un-locked, or "open," setting it is on when you are just "surfing" the Internet.
We also do everything in our power to protect your information off-line.
==========
Access to all of
your information is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to
perform their specific jobs (for example, researchers and customer service representatives) are
granted access to your information.
==========
Furthermore, all of our employees are kept up-to-date on
our security and privacy practices.
Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our
employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do
to ensure our members' information is protected.
Finally, the servers that we store your
information on are kept in a secure environment with limited personnel access.
If you have any questions about our security procedures, you can contact us.
==========
Opt-Out Policy
We provide you with the ability to opt-out of
our panel.
The instructions on how to opt-out are provided in every email survey invitation that is
sent to you.
You can also opt-out by contacting us.
==========
Modifying Your Information

Please do not email us your information changes, as we cannot guarantee the security of your
information sent via email.
You can securely modify your registration information by
going to
update profile and logging in.
==========
Sweepstake Winners Policy

When you register to become a panel member and every time you participate in a survey you will
be entered into a sweepstakes where you have a chance to win valuable prizes.
Winners will be
randomly selected from all registrants for the registration sweepstakes and from all survey
respondents for the survey sweepstakes.
All winners will be notified by email.
See
the sweepstakes rules for more information.
==========
Links
We may from time to time have links on our site to other sites.
We do not review, and are not responsible for, the content or the privacy policy of these sites.

Legal Disclaimer

We may disclose information provided by you, including information that might identify you, when
required to by law or if we determine in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with
applicable law or with legal process.
Children’s Policy
We will not knowingly gather any information
from any persons under the age of 13 without parental permission.
We abide by the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) rules and regulations.
==========
Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so you are
always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose
it.
If at any point we decide to use your information in a manner different from that stated at the
time it was collected, we will notify you by email.
You will have a choice as to whether or not we
use this information in this different manner.
We will use information in accordance with the
