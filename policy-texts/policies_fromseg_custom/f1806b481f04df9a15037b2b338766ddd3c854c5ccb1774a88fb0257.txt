Privacy Policy
Last updated: June 2007


		Please read the following Privacy Policy carefully before using Legacy.com or any
		site powered by Legacy.com (collectively, this “Site").
1.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
	
Top



This Privacy Policy covers how Legacy.com, Inc. (collectively, “Legacy.com”, “we”,
			“us”, or “our”) and all of its affiliated websites, products, and services (including
			without limitation, www.legacy.com, the Gift Shop at Legacy.com, Moving Tributes,
			ObitMessenger, Obituaries, Enhanced Obituaries, Guest Books, Death Notices, Commemorative
			Books, Life Stories, Photo Album submissions, Memorial Websites (e.g., wwww.legacymemorialwebsites.com,
			www.[deceased].Legacy.com), and other related products and services available to
			our users) (collectively, the “Services”) treats user or personally identifiable
			information that the Services collect and receive.
If, however, you are accessing
			this Privacy Policy from a website operated in conjunction with one of our affiliate
			newspapers (listed at www.legacy.com/Obituaries.asp and www.legacy.com/Obituaries.asp?Page=SelectNewspapers,
			also recognizable by the URL format www.Legacy.com/[newspaper name]) (our “Affiliate
			Newspaper(s)”), the privacy policy of the Affiliate Newspaper will govern unless
			such policy states otherwise.
Subject to the above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies
			that Legacy.com does not own or control, or to people that it does not employ or
			manage.
==========
In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any
		information about yourself.
Legacy.com does not collect personally identifiable
		information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by
		such individuals on interactive areas of the Site.
“Personally Identifiable Information”
		is information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single
		person, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card
		number, among other information, and that is not otherwise publicly available).
Any posting made while using the Site and Services can be viewed by the public and
		therefore is not considered “personal information” or “Personally Identifiable Information”
		and is not the type of information protected by this Privacy Policy.

Privacy Alert: Your Site Postings Generally Are Accessible to the Public
	
Top



Your own use of the Site may disclose personal information or Personally Identifiable
			Information to the public.
For example:
			
This Site makes Guest Books, Death Notices, Obituaries, Moving Tributes,
					Life Stories, Enhanced Obituaries, Commemorative Books, Memorial Websites, Photo
					Album submissions, and other postings to our Services available for viewing by all
					our visitors unless the sponsor or host of a Service selects a privacy setting that
					restricts public access (available as an option only on certain Services, such as
					Memorial Websites).
Please remember that any information disclosed on a non-restricted
					Service becomes public information and may be collected and used by others without
					our knowledge.
You therefore should exercise caution when disclosing any personal
					information or Personally Identifiable Information in these forums.
When you post a message to any message board, blog, or other public
					forum on the Site, your user ID or alias that you are posting under may be visible
					to other users, and you have the ability to post a message that may include personal
					information.
If you post Personally Identifiable Information online that is accessible to the
			public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
==========
Such
			activities are beyond the control of Legacy.com and this Privacy Policy.
Please
			be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
In addition, although we employ
			technology and software designed to minimize spam sent to users and unsolicited,
			automatic posts to message boards, blogs, or other public forums on the Site (like
			the CAPTCHA word verification you see on email and registration forms), we cannot
			ensure such measures to be 100% reliable or satisfactory.
6.
==========
Children’s Privacy
	
Top



Legacy.com does not intentionally or knowingly collect from or maintain Personally
			Identifiable Information of children under the age of 13, nor do we offer any content
			targeted to children.
In the event that Legacy.com becomes aware that a user of the Site is under the
			age of 13, the following additional privacy terms and notices apply:
			
Prior to collecting any Personally Identifiable Information about
					a child that Legacy.com has become aware is under the age of 13, Legacy.com will
					make reasonable efforts to contact the child’s parent, to inform the parent about
					the types of information Legacy.com will collect, how it will be used, and under
					what circumstances it will be disclosed, and to obtain consent from the child's
					parent to collection and use of such information.
Although Legacy.com will apply these children's privacy terms whenever
					it becomes aware that a user who submits Personally Identifiable Information is
					less than 13 years old, no method is foolproof.
Legacy.com strongly encourages parents
					and guardians to supervise their children's online activities and consider using
					parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers
					to help provide a child-friendly online environment.
These tools also can prevent
					children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information
					without parental permission.
==========
Personally Identifiable Information collected from children may include
					any of the information defined above as Personally Identifiable Information with
					respect to general users of the Site and may be used by Legacy.com for the same
					purposes.
Except as necessary to process a child's requests or orders placed with
					advertisers or merchants featured on the Site, Legacy.com does not rent, sell, barter
					or give away any lists containing a child's Personally Identifiable Information
					for use by any outside company.
A child's parent or legal guardian may request Legacy.com to provide
					a description of the Personally Identifiable Information that Legacy.com has collected
					from the child, as well as instruct Legacy.com to cease further use, maintenance
					and collection of Personally Identifiable Information from the child.
If a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address or
					other personally-identifying information on chat areas, bulletin boards or other
					forums or public posting areas, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages
					from other parties.
Legacy.com and/or the Affiliate Newspaper(s) are the sole owner(s) of the information
		collected on this Site.
==========
The security and confidentiality of your Personally Identifiable Information is
		extremely important to us.
We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical
		security measures to protect guest information from unauthorized access and improper
		use.
From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate
		new technology and methods.
==========
Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts,
		no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no data transmissions over
		the web can be guaranteed 100% secure.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant
		the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
