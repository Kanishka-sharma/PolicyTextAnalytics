What This Privacy Policy Covers

This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Flickr web site at http://www.flickr.com/
This privacy policy covers how Flickr treats personal information that Flickr collects and receives.
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.
Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Flickr service, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.

Information Collection and How it is used

 General Information

 Flickr collects personal information when you register with Flickr to use Flickr services or to post content on Flickr.
When you register we ask for your email address and certain optional information such as your name, birth date, birth place, gender, biographical information, ICQ/AIM/Yahoo/MSN user name, and personal interests.
If you would like to obtain a paid ("Pro") account, we will ask for your billing address, phone number, and credit card information.
Flickr automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request.
Flickr uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.
==========
IP Addresses
IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page.
Your IP address is stored in our user registration databases when you register with Flickr.
IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including: 

 To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.
To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address.
Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.
To estimate the total number of users visiting Flickr from specific geographical regions.
To make sure that people are not voting for themselves or friends during contests or promotions.
Cookies
 A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.
==========
If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Flickr products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Flickr service.
Flickr uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: 
						
 Access your information when you "sign in".
Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Flickr's services.
Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Flickr.
Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.
==========
Conduct research to improve Flickr's content and services.
Flickr lets other companies (such as Google) that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer.
Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.
Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Flickr's cookies.
==========
Information Sharing and Disclosure

When you post a message, your Flickr ID or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users.
If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Flickr may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Flickr Terms of Service.
Flickr may share demographic information with business partners, such as "53% of users who regularly user Flickr chat are between 18 and 24"	or the like.
No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission (i.e. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial)
 Flickr does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested or when we have your permission.
It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Flickr's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
==========
We will transfer information about you if Flickr is acquired by or merged with another company.
In this event, Flickr will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Flickr web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Flickr displays targeted advertisements based on personal information that is exhibited in people's profiles.
This may sometimes make you laugh, as when it shows advertisements for rabbit feed on the profile page of a person whose handle is "BunnyLove."
==========
Editing and Deleting Account Information

 You can change your Flickr Account Information, at any time.
We may send you certain communications relating to the Flickr service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part of your Flickr account.
You can delete your Flickr account at any time from your account page; however, please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain in Flickr's records for some period.
We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
Your Flickr Account Information is password-protected.
In certain areas, Flickr uses SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.
==========
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Flickr may update this policy at any time for any reason.
If there are any significant changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice to the primary email address specified in your Flickr account or by placing a				prominent notice on our site.
