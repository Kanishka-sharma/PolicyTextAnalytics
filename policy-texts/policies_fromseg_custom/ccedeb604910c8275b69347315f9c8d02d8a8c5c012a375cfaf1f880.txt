==========
How do we use data from end users?
Awin primarily uses end user data for the purpose of tracking an end user from a Publisher to an Advertiser.
Tracking enables Awin to see that an end user has visited a Publisher's service, found a product, and clicked the link to be taken to the Advertiser's service to review or purchase the product.
The purpose of tracking is to attribute sales and marketing effort by a Publisher to a particular transaction, to enable Advertisers to reward Publishers on a per transaction basis.
Tracking also allows Awin to provide Publishers and Advertisers with related reports.
The majority of these reports contain only aggregated statistical data.
==========
Awin doesn’t know who the end user is, simply that the same end user started their journey with the Publisher and completed it with the Advertiser and that the affiliate marketing campaign was therefore successful in respect of that end user.
By maintaining a limited user profile which does not reveal an end user’s name or identity, Awin can also understand an end user journey when it starts on one device, and ends on a different device.
Through this functionality, Awin can understand whether a referral is commenced on one device and completed on another device.
The profile is only used to attribute sales and marketing effort to a Publisher, even if the end user has changed devices before completing a transaction.
Awin permits Publishers to enquire as to whether an action by a user ought to have generated a commission for that Publisher.
==========
This necessitates the sharing of information, between Publishers and Advertisers.
Advertisers use the information provided by Publishers to verify against their own records.
==========
Awin enables this data sharing and the payment of any commission due to the Publisher as a result.
How do we collect data from end users?
==========
The main technologies used for Awin’s tracking are Tracking Domain Cookies, Journey Tags and Device Fingerprinting.
Awin Tracking Domain Cookies: These are cookies served by Awin’s own domain when an end user clicks on an advertisement displayed by a Publisher.
We use this information to understand which end users are referred by which Publishers to which Advertiser.
==========
Please find some general information on cookies here.
Our tracking cookies are listed here.
==========
Advertiser Journey Tag: This is JavaScript code integrated into the Advertiser’s service to enable Awin to receive transactional information from Advertisers.
Awin uses this information to record, validate and report the completion of transactions, for the purposes of apportioning commissions to Publishers.
Fingerprinting: This is a method by which Awin can uniquely identify a device by considering certain attributes of the browser or the device (incl.
==========
screen size/resolution and user configurations).
What data do we collect from end users?
We take care not to collect data that we don’t need.
The majority of the data Awin uses is machine generated.
==========
It lets us single out a person but it does not reveal who that person is.
We do not use this data to make predictions or evaluations of users’ interest or personalities.
==========
Awin is one part of the affiliate marketing ecosystem (see our Agreement with Advertisers and Publishers below) and does not always have absolute control over the personal data that it receives from users, Publishers or Advertisers.
Awin stores an individual sequence of figures in respect of a transaction that does not reveal the name of a particular end user and contains information on the Advertiser’s campaign, the Publisher, the end user action (i.e. a click or a view and in which country it occurred), and the device that is used.
Awin also receives limited transactional information via the Journey Tag, to confirm that a transaction has occurred and carry out accurate commission allocating, billing and reporting.
Such information includes the order value, whether a voucher has been used, product type, and sales channel.
==========
Awin's data processing activities relating to end user data, do not require the direct identification of an individual and therefore Awin mostly holds what is known as “pseudonymous” data in this respect.
Pseudonymisation is privacy-enhancing.
It is the separation of data from direct identifiers so that data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information.
Pseudonymisation, therefore, reduces the risks associated with data processing, while also maintaining the data’s utility.
==========
Does Awin have legitimate interest in using data?
We have carried out a balancing exercise and have identified legitimate interests as a basis for processing user data for the purposes set out in this section of the Privacy Policy.
When assessing Awin’s legitimate interest, the interests of the full affiliate ecosystem were considered.
A balancing test was carried out and it was confirmed that tracking carries no risk or a very low risk of undue negative impact on the end user’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
Legitimate interests are not limited to the interests of Awin, but can be legitimate interests of a third party or to society as a whole.
==========
In the context of our service, we consider that:
Advertisers have an interest in carrying on an online advertising campaign, paid for on a performance basis, whereby third party referrers of customers or potential customers of the Advertiser are compensated for referrals which generate revenue for the Advertiser or which undertake another act desired by the Advertiser.
Publishers have an interest in monetising their content, services or other aspects of the Publisher website by generating advertising revenue which is paid on a performance basis.
Advertisers and publishers have an interest in obtaining reports relevant to their respective business revenue generation.
==========
Awin has an interest in operating an affiliate marketing network, and to provide technology, services and reporting, in return for payment from Advertisers.
Awin, Advertisers, Publishers and society at large have an interest in preventing fraud, misuse of services, or money laundering.
==========
What is our arrangement with Publishers and Advertisers on our network?
Awin's affiliate marketing network connects Advertisers and Publishers, so that they can work together to run affiliate marketing campaigns.
==========
In running the campaign each party plays their part in pursuing the common purposes and each party can make certain decisions about the way data is used.
Awin contractually requires that its whole network is compliant with data protection law and that they each fulfil their obligations to respond to requests to exercise data subject rights.
You can approach each party, if you intend to exercise your rights in respect of the data which that party controls.
Awin works with these Advertisers.
==========
For guidance on how to make a request to a Publisher or an Advertiser, please check their respective privacy notices.
For more information of how to make a request to Awin, “What rights do you have in respect of user data” below.
For how long do we keep end user data?
==========
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
==========
As a general rule, Awin retains tracking data for 36 months after collection.
What rights do you have in respect of user data?
We will honour your rights under applicable data protection laws.
These rights are not absolute and they do not always apply in all cases.

Please note that, as described under “What data do we collect from users?”
, Awin mostly holds what is known as “pseudonymous” data in respect of users.
Pseudonymisation means that we may not be in a position to identify the individual behind the data we hold and that we therefore cannot provide them with access, rectification, erasure or data portability without the provision of additional information (for example your IP address, or Device ID).
