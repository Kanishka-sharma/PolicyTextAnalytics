Epinions.com Privacy Statement


Epinions cares about your privacy and takes special efforts to maintain your trust.
Epinions.com offers complex
tools that enable you to interact with others; this document provides a thorough description of such tools and
Epinions' practices to help you understand Epinions' approaches to privacy.
You should carefully read this Privacy
Statement (the "Statement").
==========
If you have any questions about this Statement, email privacy@epinions-inc.com.
This Statement supplements the Epinions.com User Agreement (the "Agreement").
Thus, this Statement is
incorporated into and governed by all of the terms of the Agreement.
In the event of any conflict between the terms
of the Agreement and this Statement, the terms of this Statement shall control.
This Statement applies only to information collected on Epinions.com.
It does not speak about Epinions' practices
for information collected elsewhere or the practices of any third parties, including those who operate sites on
Epinions' behalf and that display Epinions branding.
==========
Unregistered Visitors.
Epinions.com is optimized for registered users.
By registering, you can obtain benefits
such as the opportunity to write Opinions, accrue Eroyalties credits and personalize your experience by rating
and trusting others.
If you choose not to register, you can still use some portions of Epinions.com.
==========
In that case,
Epinions may collect information about you through cookies and IP addresses and by analyzing what URLs you came
from and go to.
A cookie is a small piece of information stored by a web site on your computer's hard drive.
Cookies are extensively
used by web sites as a convenient way to store information it knows about you.
If you have not registered, cookies
help Epinions understand how the site is being used and target ads based on whatever information Epinions knows
about you (which isn't much if you have not registered).
Most browsers allow you to configure your preferences
to notify you when cookies are being placed on your hard drive or to reject all cookies.
Rejecting cookies will
not noticeably affect your experience as an unregistered visitor.
==========
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
In some cases
your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access
provider such as AOL or Earthlink, your IP address probably varies each session-thus making it difficult for Epinions
to use your IP address (by itself) to determine who you are.
When you visit the site, Epinions.com servers log
your IP address, which is used for, among other things, systems administration and aggregated usage reports.
==========
Even as an unregistered visitor, you may be given opportunities to voluntarily interact with the reviews and ratings
database, such as the opportunity to rate products and services.
These ratings do not modify the overall publicly-displayed
database unless and until you register; however, Epinions may adjust your personalized view of Epinions.com based
on your activities.
Registered Users and Cookies/IP Addresses.
If you register, Epinions uses cookies and IP addresses as described
above.
In addition, Epinions uses cookies to store your preferences and passwords for your convenience, to provide
you with a more personalized experience, and to track your use of the site.
You must accept cookies to access the
site as a registered user.
==========
Your Registration and Member Information.
When you register, Epinions asks you for a number of pieces of information.
If you register through a co-branded site, the co-brand partner may be transferring to Epinions some or all of
the required registration information or possibly other information about you.
Epinions also allows you to tell
more about yourself through the "Member Information" link on your account management page.
Epinions uses such registration and member information internally for a number of purposes, including: 


email distribution as described in the Agreement, as you request on Epinions.com (such as promotional opportunities
or newsletters if you select to receive them, and as described below in Section 9), and for administrative purposes
(such as to notify you about changes to the Agreement or this Statement or to contact you regarding redemptions
of Eroyalties credits or other issues with your account).
In accordance with instructions on the site, you may
opt not to receive certain types of emails in the future, and Epinions will use reasonable efforts to honor your
request.
On the other hand, most email for administrative purposes, such as email about Agreement changes or invitations
to become an Advisor, are mandatory so long as you have an account with Epinions.com.
consider and personally offer you possible special opportunities, such as to get extra exposure on the site or
accrue more Eroyalties credits.
==========
display banner (and similar) advertising to you in connection with the site that is more targeted to you specifically.
In doing this type of targeting, Epinions or its ad server, and not the advertiser, connect you with the targeting
criteria.
Through your account page, you have some choices about whether or not to display certain member information publicly
on Epinions.com.
If you register through a co-branded site, Epinions may be required to give the co-brand partner some or all of
your registration information to them.
While Epinions will use such information in accordance with this Statement,
it does not always control how the co-brand partners use or disclose such information.
However, the co-brand partner
is governed by their privacy policies.
If you have any concerns about such privacy policies, you should contact
the co-brand partner.
==========
In some cases, Epinions may allow you to express interest in or register for third parties products and services.
If you express interest, Epinions will turn over data about you to the third party to implement your request.
You may terminate your account or request the removal of your registration and member information from member records
by emailing communitycare@epinions-inc.com.
Epinions will send you an email to confirm your request.
==========
After you
respond, Epinions will use reasonable efforts to remove most of your information from its "live" database,
but residual information may remain in archives and records and certain information may remain to continue displaying
your Opinions if Epinions chooses to do so.
In any case, Epinions may not be able to propagate changes to your
registration and member information to its co-brand partners who have received such information.
In addition, if
your account is being terminated for violations of the Agreement, Epinions may keep some of your registration information
active to prevent re-registration.
==========
Your Opinions.
All information you submit as part of an Opinion is automatically displayed on Epinions.com and
some or all of its syndication partners (so long as it passes the applicable filters).
Epinions and the syndication
partners may use such information in accordance with the license granted in the Agreement.
This includes the right
to use the Opinion or teaser portions (including your identity and photo) throughout the site, on other sites on
the web, and offline.
If you have registered through a co-branded site, please be aware that Epinions may be required
to transfer your Opinions to the co-brand partner for their use and display.
Subject to the limitations discussed
in the Agreement, you can update or delete an Opinion using the tools available to you on each Opinion page.
==========
However,
if the Opinion has been transferred to other sites or parties, your changes may not propagate to these other places.
Your Comments to Other Opinions.
Posting comments to other people's Opinions automatically displays your identity.
This is true even if you have rated the Opinion anonymously.
Epinions may choose (but is not required) to transfer your comments to third parties if Epinions
transfers the associated Opinion.
==========
Your Personal Profile Pages.
Epinions allows you to display a large variety of personal information about yourself
through the tools that edit your personal profile page.
As you can see when you edit your preferences on this page,
you have choices about whether to display or hide this information, and you can change this information at any
time (although, as discussed elsewhere, it may not be possible to propagate all of these changes instantly or ever).
Please note that whatever URL you choose to link to your photo will cause that photo to be displayed in many places
throughout the site (not just on the personal profile page).
Epinions does not transfer your personal profile in total to third parties, but may transfer pieces of your personal
profile page in accordance with your instructions, in situations similar to those described under the Registration
and Member Information heading above, or as described elsewhere in this Statement.
Your Rating of Others and Other "Transactional Information."
==========
One of the most powerful aspects of Epinions.com
is its ability to personalize your experience based on your personal interests.
The system assesses your prior
experiences on Epinions.com (as evidenced by how you've rated other Opinions or trusted/blocked other members),
and then uses these experiences to dynamically sort the database of Opinions for you based on those that are more
likely to interest you.
To do this, Epinions captures information about your interactions with other users and
then processes this information when you look for Opinions.
The more you interact with others, the more personalized
your subsequent uses of Epinions.com will be.
==========
In rating others' Opinions, you have a choice of whether or not to display your identity.
If you do not hide your
identity when rating, the Opinion author and other readers of the Opinion may see your rating.
You can also hide or reveal your identity in trusting others either on an individual basis or across all people
you trust.
You can change your mind and hide/reveal your identity in trusting others by following the instructions
on the site.
However, you cannot reveal your identity when blocking someone.
==========
Except as otherwise contemplated in this Statement, Epinions does not transfer the complete database of rating
and transactional information to others.
However, the database may be used throughout other sites Epinions operates,
whether branded solely by Epinions, co-branded with others, or operated for others on a private-label basis.
Eroyalties Credit Redemption.
Epinions may ask you for additional information to process a request for Eroyalties
credit redemption.
Epinions may choose to add such information to our database record about you, which will be
treated the same as other business records.
Without limiting the foregoing, Epinions uses your mailing address
information to send you redeemed Eroyalties credits and, in limited circumstances, other communications.
With respect
to your social security number, it is Epinions' policy not to disclose this number to third parties except as required
by law or as otherwise contemplated by this Statement.
If you are a US resident and redeem more than $600 in a
calendar year, Epinions will submit a 1099 about you to the IRS; if you are not a US resident, Epinions will report
to the IRS information about your earnings on Epinions.com as required by law.
Also, Epinions may choose to feature
your Member ID in promotional materials (both online and offline) to highlight your earnings successes.
Email Notifications.
In a number of places, Epinions provides the option to receive an email when an activity
occurs.
For example, you can choose to be emailed if a specific other member writes a Opinion or a comment, or
if a new Opinion is written on a certain product.
If you choose to be notified when another member writes an Opinion
or comment, that other member will be able to see that you've done so.
==========
Advisors.
Epinions has a number of special promotions and communications directed to Advisors.
Thus, during
the period of time when you are an Advisor, any restrictions in this Statement limiting Epinions' ability to communicate
with you do not apply.
==========
Integrated Services.
Although Epinions doesn't currently offer any integrated services operated by third parties
as part of your registration, Epinions expects to do so in the future.
These could include functionality like an
Epinions.com email account.
In these circumstances, Epinions may transfer some or all of your registration information
and other information to the third party to operate the integrated service if you choose to use these services.
Epinions expects to notify you before allowing you to use a third party integrated service so that you may make
a decision at that time if you want the information to be passed.
==========
Internal Analyses and Reports.
Epinions uses all of the information in its databases, including personal information
you've submitted, your transactional/Web of Trust experiences, and other server and usage logs, to analyze the
site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes and address complaints, and prepare aggregated
reports that are shared with others.
Other Information.
Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Statement (if any) may be found throughout the site.
To the extent that, during your submission of information on Epinions.com, you are notified of privacy practices which are different from those described in this Statement, those alternative disclosures will govern that submission.
==========
There may be situations where Epinions collects data through a survey or similar process when the page does not
link to this Statement.
In those cases, unless you are informed otherwise, you should assume that Epinions treats
all information from such pages as it treats its other valuable business records.
Of course, there are many other ways in which Epinions could get information from or about you that are not described
elsewhere in this Statement.
For example, you might send email through a customer service email address, or Epinions
may get a complaint about you from a third party.
Epinions' practices with respect to such information are pretty
much as you'd expect-Epinions  uses and discloses this information in a commercially reasonable business manner.
==========
Children.
Epinions feels strongly about protecting the privacy of children and encourages kids to involve their
parents in any interactive activity they participate in online.
If you are 12 or younger and Epinions learns your
age, you are not eligible to use Epinions.com.
If you are under 18, Epinions encourages you to use Epinions.com
with the help of your parents, but you are not eligible to participate in the Eroyalties program.
==========
Contractors and Third Party Service Providers.
Epinions uses contractors to help with its operations.
Some
or all of these contractors may access the databases of user information.
Usually these contractors will enter
into an agreement that places restrictive provisions on their use and disclosure of all information they obtain
through the relationship.
Epinions also uses third party service providers to help with certain aspects of its operations that may require
disclosure of your personal information to them.
For example, Epinions may use a third party service provider to
mail Eroyalties redemption checks, serve ads, or deliver some or all of the emails sent as part of the site's normal
operation.
==========
Again, usually Epinions will place extensive restrictions on the ability of these third parties to use
and disclose your personal information except as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.
Ads on the Epinions site are served by third parties including DoubleClick.
These third parties may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or 
otherwise, may collect and use information (not including your name, address 
email address or telephone number) from your visits to this and other websites 
to deliver ads to you.
To learn more about DoubleClick's practices and your 
options regarding their information collection and use, visit
http://www.doubleclick.net:8080/privacy_policy/.
The "Corporate Family."
==========
Although Epinions currently does not have a parent company, any subsidiaries,
joint ventures or other companies under a common control, it might in the future.
In these cases, Epinions would
expect to, and may, share some or all of your information with these other companies, in which case Epinions will
ask such entities to honor the promises in this Statement.
In addition, as part of a diligence review, Epinions
may disclose some or all of your personal information to a potential acquirer or merger partner, although in this
case Epinions would restrict their use and disclosure of this information during the diligence phase.
==========
Government Relations and Lawsuits.
In some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of information about
you, and of course Epinions will need to comply.
However, irrespective of those situations, Epinions can unilaterally
turn over information about you to the government if it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case
you authorize it to do so.
You also consent to Epinions disclosing information about you to actual or potential
parties to a lawsuit that Epinions is or may become involved in (a) if it is required to do so, (b) if it reasonably
believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to enforce its rights.
==========
Collecting Personal Information from Epinions.com.
Many friendships have developed through Epinions.com, and
Epinions wants the community to be vibrant and engaged.
Thus, Epinions is delighted when users begin communicating
with each other outside the context of Epinions.com.
==========
However, not every user wants to engage in these types of
dialogue, and Epinions believes each user should have the right to set the boundaries that feel right to them.
Thus, you may not collect, use or store any personal information about other users on Epinions.com for any purpose
whatsoever unless the user invites you to do so.
Thus, if a user displays an email address in his or her personal
profile, you can assume that the user is willing to receive a single personal email from you that has some relation
to Epinions.com.
However, without that user's permission, you may not contact the user about something that has
nothing to do with Epinions, store that user's contact information in a database for further communications, or
continue to contact the user if they have requested you not to.
In all circumstances, as described in the Agreement,
you may not use robots, scripts or other automated procedures to collect any information, including user contact
information, from the site.
You may also not email users inviting them to join your own review site under any circumstance-doing
so is a theft of Epinions' valuable rights and an affront to users.
Epinions will protect its users' interests-and
its own interests-very vigorously in this regard.
==========
Your Use of Email Tools.
Epinions may provide you with tools that allow you to send email to your friends.
If you use these tools, the email will include your email address, as well as any personal message you choose to
include.
Epinions does not store, in any easily-retrievable way, the email addresses of the friends you are communicating
with.
You may not use these tools to send spam or to send content that would violate the Agreement.
Without limiting
the foregoing, you may not send "Sponsor a Friend" invitations to anyone who would not welcome the message
or post any invitations to any web sites, message boards, mail lists or USENET groups (unless you are the owner
of that venue).
==========
In any case, you should not assume that emails processed by Epinions are private communications.
Limits on Epinions' Abilities.
A site and service as complicated as Epinions.com is never perfect, and thus
Epinions may inadvertently make uses or disclosures of your information in ways not contemplated by, or in direct
contravention of, this Statement.
==========
For example, if the software has a temporary glitch, your personal information
could be displayed on the site even though you've configured your preferences otherwise.
Epinions might also make
ad hoc uses of your information in ways it can't contemplate here.
Epinions will do its best to work with you if
these types of situations arise, but your sole remedy in these cases is to have Epinions try to rectify the problem
as soon as it can.
==========
In addition, although highly unlikely, it is possible for Internet transmissions containing your personal information
to be intercepted by others.
It is impossible for Epinions to ensure the privacy and security of all transmissions
made to and from the site while in transit.
Of course, Epinions does not control the privacy practices of its advertisers and other third-party sites that
it promotes or links to.
If you click through a banner ad or link and submit your information to an advertiser,
you will be subject to their privacy policies.
Please make sure you understand these policies before submitting
your information.
Security Practices.
Epinions uses industry-standard methods of securing its databases of user information,
such as, if and where appropriate, firewalls and limits on who can access user information databases.
However,
please keep in mind that there is no such thing as perfect security on the Internet.
==========
