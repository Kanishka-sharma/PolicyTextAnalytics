SBS Privacy Policy

SBS is
committed to providing a safe and welcoming digital environment, and to be open
and transparent about how we collect and use your information when you use our website,
apps and other online services or interact with us in other ways.
In this Privacy Policy we’ll talk about
how SBS manages your personal information (where you disclose identifiable
information about yourself), as well as how we manage other information associated with your use of our digital services
which we collect but which is effectively anonymous.
In particular, we’d like to help you understand important topics like:
·        
What information we collect
·        
How we use that information
·        
How you can control your information
·        
The measures we take to keep your information
secure
·        
What to do if you need help or have any
questions about your personal data.
1.
==========
Information we collect and hold

SBS may request, collect and hold the
following kinds of information in either electronic or hard copy format.
a) Competition and registration information
When you sign up for a competition,
register as an SBS user on our digital services, or request an email
newsletter, we will ask you to provide personal details such as your first
name, surname, and email address.
To help with prize distribution and entry
eligibility as part of a competition, SBS may also request a mailing address,
phone number and your date of birth.
SBS will also invite you to offer other
optional information through your user profile so that we can tailor our
services to your specific interests or profile.
This includes information such
as the types of content you are interested in (for instance, sport, food or
movies), and whether you’d like to receive information or offers from our
partners.
==========
b) Information you post on our digital services
When you interact with SBS and the SBS
community on our digital services as a registered SBS user or using social
media (for example by making a public comment on a particular topic), we may
collect the information you choose to post (such as your opinion about a matter
you are commenting on, which may include sensitive information you choose to make
public).
You should be careful about making any sensitive or personal
information public.
c) Your social media information
Some of our digital services are linked
to third party social media services like Facebook or Twitter.
You can decide
to access or log in to an SBS service using your social media profile, or to
connect an SBS related service to a third party social media service.
If you do
this, SBS can collect your social media user information, and any further
information you have permitted the social media site to share with SBS.
In
choosing to access or connect to SBS services via social media, you are
authorising SBS to collect, store, use and disclose such information and
content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
You should be aware that any posts you
make on SBS social media channels including our Facebook, Twitter or Instagram
profiles may be publicly available and able to be found via search engines.
SBS
strongly recommends that you become familiar with the privacy settings and
terms of your social media account/s.
d) Cookies and other tracking data
When you use SBS’s digital services,
information about your usage will automatically be gathered by SBS, or third
parties contracted by SBS, through tracking devices including the use of cookies,
web beacons and web server logs.
==========
These tracking devices are not used to record
any personally identifiable information such as your name or email address.
The
information collected is aggregated, and is effectively anonymous to us.
This information helps us to:
·         
monitor, analyse and improve our digital services, for example by
showing us what visitors do and don’t use, and assisting us in detecting any
problems with our services
·         
customise our services based on content accessed, for example by recommending
content that matches your interests
·         
serve you more relevant advertising based on your site visits
·         
manage the number of times you are served particular advertisements.
SBS contracts with a range of third
party providers for these purposes.
The type of information gathered
typically includes geographic location, date and time of site visits, your
server (IP) address.
e) By contacting or interacting with SBS for a
specific reason such as lodging a complaint or applying for a job
SBS may collect and hold personal and
sensitive information about you in order to respond to any enquiries, or to
carry out our business and operational functions, such as personnel management.
The information we collect will depend on the type of information we need to manage
these matters.
==========
For example personnel records may
include personal and sensitive information such as name, address, date of
birth, disabilities, place of birth, ancestry, tax file number, and
relationship information.
Recruitment records may include employment history
and experience, referees and other employment related information.
SBS studio
audience registration records may include sensitive information such as
cultural background, political party affiliation and other organisation
affiliation information.
==========
f) Collecting personal information from children
and young people
SBS is committed to providing a safe
and welcoming digital environment for children and young people.
Some of our
activities, such as SBS Learn, are directed to
children and young people.
SBS may collect personal information directly from
children and young people for the purpose of these activities.
Where SBS considers that capacity to
consent to the collection of the personal information is at issue, SBS will
notify a parent or guardian of the activity, and seek their consent.
If you are a parent or guardian, you
should read and explain this Privacy Policy and any applicable house rules with
your child if you think they may not understand how it applies.
==========
g) Information sourced from other parties
In some circumstances, SBS may source
information about you which is on the public record, or can be requested from
third parties.
For example, when you
apply for a job or internship at SBS, SBS will seek information from you
directly, but may also collect information about you from third parties
(including your previous employers and recruitment consultants).
2.
==========
How we use your information

SBS will use and disclose your personal
information for:
·        
the main purpose for which it was collected
·        
appropriate secondary purposes under the terms of the Privacy Act, such
as where you have consented to the secondary use or disclosure, or where SBS
considers you would reasonably expect SBS to use or disclose the information.
Whenever we collect
information from you, it’s for purposes related to our core functions and to
help us provide you with a better service.
This includes: 
Providing the product
or service you have requested – such as sending you an email
newsletter, accepting your entry into a competition, or giving you access to an
app.
Understanding our
audience behaviour to improve our services, or your experience of our services – such as website
optimisation for a better online experience.
Giving you a more
personalised experience by providing you with information that is relevant
to your unique interests – such as making program recommendations.
Helping us sell
advertising – so that we can reinvest in the free services provided to you.
To enable you to
engage with SBS and other SBS users, for example by re-publishing content you provide to
us such as competition entries or social media posts together with your name or
social media handle or profile name.
In providing and managing the services
offered by SBS, SBS may need to make your information available to third party
service and content providers, including providers of cloud services, website
hosts, and other companies.
==========
These third parties may be located overseas in
countries including the USA, Europe and Singapore.
SBS will ensure that any third parties who receive your personal information
from SBS follow the same standards and obligations set out in this privacy
policy, and only use your information for the specific purpose and service they
are providing to you or SBS.
SBS contracts with a range of party
providers for these purposes.
These include Roy Morgan (you may read the Roy
Morgan Privacy Policy here).
==========
If you would like
to learn more about how SBS uses third parties to collect and use information
on this website please contact the SBS Privacy Contact Officer (see the contact
details section below).
Cookies and other tracking data
If data about your use of SBS’s digital
services is de-identified, aggregated or otherwise made anonymous, SBS may
collect, use and share that information for any purpose with third parties
provided that in doing so we do not reveal any personal information and the use
is related to SBS’s activities.
No attempt will be made to identify SBS
website users or their browsing activities except where necessary to prevent or
lessen a serious and imminent threat to a person’s life or health, or as
otherwise permitted or required by law.
==========
SBS may
combine the anonymous information about you collected from your use of our
digital services to build up an idea about the types of products or services
and advertising that might interest you.
By
understanding more about you, we are able to serve you more tailored, relevant
advertising and SBS content.
When this information is used to target more relevant advertising to
you it is known as online behavioural advertising.
Revenue generated
from personalised advertising is used to improve the free digital services from
SBS.
You can opt out of these targeted services – see
under ‘How you can control your information’.
3.
==========
How you can control your information

SBS is committed to helping you control the collection and use of your
personal information, including marketing communications.
You may opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us
(including  surveys or
notifications) by changing your account
settings through the appropriate link on the subscription preferences page or following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each
email.
Please note that if you have an active SBS profile, there are
certain service notifications that you may not opt-out of, such as
notifications of changes to SBS services or policies.
If you have installed a
mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change
the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.
==========
You may choose to opt out of the
tracking devices used on SBS’s digital services.
If you choose to opt out of
these tracking devices you may not be able to access all of the services on the
SBS website and your experience will not be fully optimal.

==========
Accessing and correcting your personal information
If you subscribe to SBS email
newsletters or have created an SBS profile, you can access and correct profile
data about yourself at any time by logging into the SBS website.
You’re also entitled to access records
that contain personal information about yourself by contacting the SBS Privacy
Contact Officer (see the contact details section below).
You may also seek the
correction of any information held by SBS.
SBS will take reasonable steps to
correct the personal information it holds to ensure that, having regard to the
purpose for which it is held, it is accurate, up to date, complete and not
misleading.
==========
Anonymity and pseudonymity
Where possible, you may also interact
with SBS anonymously or using a pseudonym should you choose to do so.
For
example, if you wish to provide feedback without requiring a response from SBS,
you will not be required to provide a full name or email address.
However, in some cases it will not be
practicable to interact with you anonymously or with a pseudonym, or it may be
impossible to provide the service you are requesting without some form of
personal information.
For example, if you wish to subscribe to an SBS email
newsletter, an email address must be provided.
SBS uses a combination of technical, administrative,
personnel and physical measures to safeguard personal information in its
possession against loss, theft and unauthorised use, disclosure or
modification.
However, no one can guarantee the
complete safety of your information.
If you have reason to believe that your
interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the
security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please
immediately notify us of the problem by contacting the SBS Privacy Contact
Officer (see the contact details below).
==========
In some instances, including where you
are using third party social media platforms to engage with SBS, these
platforms are not under the control of SBS.
If security is of concern to you,
we encourage you to carefully consider the terms and conditions and security
used by any third party platform.
5.
==========
Compliance with Australian legislation

SBS is a government agency and is
subject to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles in
relation to the personal information it collects.
The Privacy Act does not apply to any
acts done or practices engaged with in relation to SBS's program material.
The
general purpose of this exemption, and the exemption in the Privacy Act for the
acts and practices of private sector media organisations done in the course of
journalism, is to allow for the free flow of information to the public.
==========
The SBS Codes of Practice set out how
SBS manages the privacy of individuals in SBS content.
If you feel that SBS
content that relates to you has breached the SBS Codes of Practice, you can
make a Code complaint.
Information on the SBS Codes of Practice and the
complaint process is available here.
==========
Privacy and third party organisations
This Privacy Policy only applies to SBS
and its digital services.
It does not apply to any other company or
organisation, including organisations whose digital services are linked to
SBS’s online content or services (such as social media platforms and online
retailers).
If you are using a third party site to interact with SBS, or you
navigate from the SBS website to a separate site to view advertising or to
engage with a service, this activity is not covered by SBS’s Privacy Policy.
6.
==========
Changes to the SBS Privacy Policy

SBS will
review and update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Updates will be posted
to the SBS
Privacy web page.
If you think that an act or practice of
SBS has interfered with your privacy you may make a complaint to SBS.
You will
need to identify yourself and provide your complaint in written form addressed
to the SBS Privacy Contact Officer (see the contact details below).
The SBS Privacy Contact Officer will
investigate your complaint and will endeavour to provide a written response
within 30 days of receipt of the complaint setting out SBS's decision.
If you are dissatisfied with SBS's response
