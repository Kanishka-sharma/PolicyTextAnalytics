Straight talk about Internet privacy.
Edited 8.4.00
Verizon (the company formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE) respects your right to privacy.
When you visit this site, as well as the www.bellatlantic.com and www.gte.com sites, you may provide information on two different levels about your visit:
Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site, and
Personal information you knowingly give us.
We want you to be aware of what information we collect, and how we handle this information.
If you would like additional information, visit our Customer Service Policies.
==========
What it means to me for Verizon to be a TRUSTe licensee?
This confirms that Verizon is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.
Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.
==========
When you visit a web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified regarding:
What identifiable information is collected about you
What organization is collecting the information
How the information is used
With whom the information may be shared
What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control, and
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first Contact Us.
If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe.
TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.
What information does the Web site gather?
Please be assured that we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us.
==========
This means that you can visit our Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself (such as your e-mail address, software you are using, or any information about yourself).
As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally.
Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:
How many people visit our site
Which pages people visit on our site
From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com)
Which browsers people use to visit our site
None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below).
We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.
What about pages that asks for personal information?
When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested).
For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job.
The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account number, a credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address.
When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this individually identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner.
==========
For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful.
If you do not want us to contact you, you can remove your name from our telephone or mail solicitation lists.
Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Verizon will contact you via email notifying you of this change and to give you the opportunity to choose to opt-out of such use.
==========
What happens to information when I fill out registration forms?
We encourage all visitors to register with us, although registration is only required for access to online billing or local account management.
The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you.
Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters.
You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to Contact Us and emailing us a request to remove your name from the online billing application.
For our local phone service customers, you may also be given the option of registering a profile with us (limited to specific areas).
This would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future.
You may opt out of this feature at any time by either going to Contact Us and emailing us your request, or in some applications you can cancel/change your profile within the application itself.
==========
We strive to ensure that the information we obtain and use about customers is accurate.
Please notify us to review or modify an personal information we have previously collected from you or if you find an error in your bill.
Customers have access to their account information via our monthly bills or by establishing an account online.
To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future.
We will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.
==========
Do you sell or give my information to non-Verizon companies?

==========

What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third party ad servers?
As part of the online advertising process, we use information supplied from third party companies in several ways however, this is aggregated data and does not personally identify any individual online user.
This data is used to:
gain a better understanding of the type of individuals viewing or visiting different web sites,
evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plans,
geographically target advertising,
deliver product and pricing advertising/information applicable to the customers' state, and gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising.
==========
Personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number or email address is not collected.
In addition, some Verizon websites may accept advertisements from third party advertisers.
These advertisers are carefully selected to provide information about products and services that we think may benefit Verizon customers.
These third party advertisers may collect non-personally identifiable information about users of this website for the same reasons listed above, but personally identifiable information is not collected.
Verizon does not have control of nor access to any information contained in the cookies that are set by third party advertisers.
Non Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically

==========
Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
To disable cookies, click here.
However, you need to understand that some websites/adserving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the adserving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.
Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent adserving companies from reestablishing history on a visitor.
The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out.
==========
When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie.
This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future.
Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.
==========
Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system.
At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie.
Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.

Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Verizon will contact you via email notifying you of this change and to give you the opportunity to choose to opt-out of such use.
==========
Who do I contact if I am concerned about online advertising and privacy?
All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising should be sent to Verizon care of our Webmaster.
Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile its customers?
