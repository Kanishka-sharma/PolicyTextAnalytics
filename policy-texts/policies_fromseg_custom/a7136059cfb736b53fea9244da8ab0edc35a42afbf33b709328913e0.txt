It also explains your rights to control our use of these tracking technologies.
For additional information about our privacy practices, please review our Privacy Policy.
==========
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or other internet-enabled device that enable our features and functionality.
==========
They allow us to record information when you visit or interact with our websites, products and services (collectively, our “Websites”).
Other tracking technologies, such as web beacons and pixels work similarly to cookies, placing small data files on your device that monitor your Website activity.
How do we use cookies?
We use cookies and other tracking technologies to make our Websites easier to use and to better tailor them to your interests and needs.
We use the information we obtain from cookies and other tracking technologies to carry out profiling activities in order to learn more about you and offer you tailored advertising based on your behavior on our Websites.
We also use these technologies to compile anonymous, aggregated information that allow us to better understand our customers and visitors.
==========
What kinds of cookies and tracking technologies do we use?
Persistent and Session Cookies
We use two categories of cookies: Persistent cookies and session cookies.
Persistent cookies are cookies that help us recognize you.
==========
They are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences and actions across multiple sites and on multiple visits.
Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session, allowing us to link your actions during a particular browsing session.
Third Party Cookies
In addition to the first party cookies set by us, we also use third party cookies.
Third party cookies are cookies that are set by others, enabling the third party’s features or functionalities to be provided through the Website you are using.
The third party setting these cookies can recognize your device both when it visits our Website and when it visits certain other websites or services.
For example, our paid endorsers, or affiliates, may use third party cookies to identify you as a referral so they can be compensated if you sign up for services from us as a result of visiting one of our paid endorsers.
The service providers of third-party cookies have their own privacy policies, and may use their cookies to target advertising to you.
Cross-Device Tracking
We perform cross-device tracking which allows us to provide more relevant advertising to you on multiple devices.
We do this by identifying browsing activity on your smartphones, tablets, desktop computers and other devices connected to the same IP address or logged into the same account to better understand the products and services that might be of interest to you.
==========
Local Storage Objects
We also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs), such as HTML5, to, among other things, optimize screen presentation, video and other preference information.
Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with our Websites.
Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our Website.
==========
This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Websites.
The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors.
==========
