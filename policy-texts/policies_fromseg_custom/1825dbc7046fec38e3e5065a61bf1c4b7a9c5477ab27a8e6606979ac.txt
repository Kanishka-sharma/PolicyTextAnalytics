Collection of Your Personal Information  In order to access some Microsoft services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your credentials.
In most cases, these credentials will be part of the Microsoft Passport Network, which means you can use the same credentials to sign in to many different Microsoft sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners.
By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically signed into other Microsoft sites and services.
If you access our services via a mobile phone, you may also use your telephone number and a PIN as an alternative credential to your username and password.
As part of creating your credentials, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as well as an alternate email address.
Some services may require added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key.
Finally, a unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials which will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.
At some Microsoft sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number.
We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.
If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, that is used to create a Microsoft billing account.
