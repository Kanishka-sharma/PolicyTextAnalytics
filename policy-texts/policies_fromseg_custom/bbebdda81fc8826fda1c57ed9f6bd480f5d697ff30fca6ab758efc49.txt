Scrip programs allow you to instruct Gap to divert a percentage of the amount you spend to participating schools and other non-profit organizations.
Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at Gap, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate.
If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty, or other similar program in which Gap is a participating vendor, the company administering the scrip, loyalty, or other similar program (collectively, the "scrip company") should provide a link on its website that permits you to authorize Gap or our credit card processor(s) to provide information about your Gap purchases.
The information you authorize us to disclose to the scrip company will include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may also include your name and other information you have asked us to provide.
Please note that once Gap discloses this information, the scrip company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy.
