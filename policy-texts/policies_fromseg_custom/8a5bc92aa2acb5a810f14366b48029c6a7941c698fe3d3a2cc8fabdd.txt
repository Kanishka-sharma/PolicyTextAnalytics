==========
You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Agreement or any portion thereof.
Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees.
Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed up to the effective date of termination.
==========
Payments & Invoicing.
Any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form.

==========
In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Payment by Credit Card.
In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
Payment Disputes.
If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration.
Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full.
Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
==========
Taxes.
Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "Taxes").
If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.
For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes.
==========
In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("Withholding Tax"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax.
You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
==========
Overdue Charges.
If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.
==========
Term for Paid Services.

Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, use the “Submit a Ticket” function at http://help.branch.io/) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
Termination by Branch.
Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable.
Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice of such violation.
