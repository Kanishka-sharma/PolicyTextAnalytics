Other Information / Aggregate Data
Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Drawbridge through the Site, we receive and store certain non-personally identifiable information.
Such information, which is collected passively using the technologies set out below, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
Drawbridge may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Drawbridge affiliates, agents or service providers.
==========
We may use such information and pool it with other information to analyze, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site and how such users interact with the Site.
In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies" which is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site.
Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.
Third party partners, with whom we contract, use cookies as well as a technology called “clear gifs”.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
The third party cookies and clear gifs on our Site are used to help us better understand how visitors interact with our Site.

Aggregated Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Drawbridge Services, Drawbridge may compile and analyze on an aggregate basis, information about its Customers, and Drawbridge may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data but does not identify you personally.
Drawbridge may also disclose aggregated Customer statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Data Collected through the Drawbridge Services about Users
The Drawbridge Services allow us to collect and store information about User interactions with third-party websites and applications that use our SDK or server-to-server connection.
For example, Drawbridge receives information from its Customers.
==========
The information we receive from server-side platforms may include data such as, the page a User has requested, the date and time the User has visited the page, the device internet protocol (IP) address, mobile device identifier(such as Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID), geolocation (including GPS coordinates), browser type, carrier, referring/exit pages, device model, operating system, gender, age, clickstream data and cookie information.
This User data is collected through ad requests received from various advertising exchanges, platform and ad networks.
Our Services use a technology called "cookies" which is a piece of information that the computer that hosts a site or advertisement gives to a User’s browser when a User accesses a site or advertisement.
Cookies are used to collect and store information about web browsers across web sites over time.
Third party partners, with whom we contract, use cookies as well as a technology called "clear gifs".
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a User’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We also receive information about Users from advertisers and/or their service providers such as mobile device identifiers, IP addresses, website cookie information and post-conversion data.
We combine the information we collect about Users with additional demographic, geolocation and interest-based segment data, along with cookie information, from third-party providers.
==========
Drawbridge does not use any data segments it considers sensitive such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or sensitive health categories to tailor ads on behalf of our Customers.
Drawbridge partners with BlueKai to receive information about non-sensitive health and wellness categories.

==========
Our Use of User Data Collected Through Our Services
We use the traffic data we receive through our technologies, in conjunction with other third-party demographic, geographic and interest-based segment data, to provide services to our Customers such as tools to see how their website or mobile applications are used and tools to enable the display of targeted advertisements to Users, including across a User’s devices.
For example, we use the information we receive to determine the probability that a desktop web cookie and a mobile device belong to the same User and may share this device matching information with our Customers to enable them to provide advertising, analytics or other services.
We may share other information with Customers such as device IDs and advertisement conversion data in the ordinary course of our business.
