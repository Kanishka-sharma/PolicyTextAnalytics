Success!
"Thanks to
Friends Reunited, I have found my daughter who I have not seen since she was 13.
She is now 27 and I have discovered that I am a grandfather and my daughter has another on the way.
This would have been an impossible task had it not been for
Friends Reunited.
==========
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. "

They encrypt Members' credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly.
This means that Members' credit card details are never revealed to us.
Worldpay plc may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties.
