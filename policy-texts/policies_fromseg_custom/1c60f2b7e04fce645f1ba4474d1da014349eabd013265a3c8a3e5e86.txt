Law and Forum for Legal Disputes - These Terms of Use shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
You agree that any Claim or other dispute you may have against Chegg must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California, except as otherwise agreed by you and Chegg or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below.

Arbitration Option - For any Claim (excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may, but shall have no obligation to, elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.
