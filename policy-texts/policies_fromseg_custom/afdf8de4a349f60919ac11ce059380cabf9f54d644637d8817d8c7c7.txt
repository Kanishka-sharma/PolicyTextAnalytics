To function properly, Hotjar stores first-party cookies on your visitor's browser.
Cookies are either set by the Hotjar script, or by visiting Hotjar's website.
Displaying the correct content to your visitors without personally identifying anyone relies on Hotjar's cookies.
If you are looking to not be tracked by Hotjar or any site that uses Hotjar, you may do so here.
Should my users be aware of these cookies?
Since privacy laws vary from country to country, we recommend that you consult with your legal team or company to determine which cookies need to be listed on your site and whether or not a cookie manager should be utilized.

_hjid Hotjar cookie.
This cookie is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script.
It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser.
This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.

_hjRecordingLastActivity This should be found in sessionStorage (as opposed to cookies).
This gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).
Session
hjTLDTest When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname.
==========
This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable).
To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails.
After this check, the cookie is removed.
Session
_hjUserAttributesHash User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.
Session
_hjCachedUserAttributes This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample.
These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.
Session
_hjLocalStorageTest This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage.
If it can, a value of 1 is set in this cookie.
==========
The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted immediately after creating it so the expected storage time is under 100ms.
N/A
_hjptid  This cookie is set for logged in users of Hotjar, who have Admin Team Member permissions.
It is used during pricing experiments to show the Admin consistent pricing across the site.
