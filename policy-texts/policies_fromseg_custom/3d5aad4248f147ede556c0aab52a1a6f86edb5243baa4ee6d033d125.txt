Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to the European Union citizens protected by the GDPR legal framework.
Pub Ocean considers the protection of Internet user data privacy to be of utmost importance, and adheres
        strictly to the data privacy laws of the European Union and United Kingdom.
Pub Ocean's web traffic measurement and analytics platform ("RTA") acts as a data processor on behalf of the
        publishers who installed the RTA tracker on their web sites.
No data to third parties
Pub Ocean RTA does not pass any data to third parties.
==========
IP addresses

        The IP address is sent with every request, so that the server knows where to send its responses.
Each Internet
        user attains an IP address from an Internet service provider (ISP) as soon as they connect to the Internet.
The
        ISP knows which IP addresses were used at which time and by which Internet user.
The law requires that the ISP
        retains this information.
==========
Pub Ocean does not store full IP Address.
We use full IP address for geographic analysis (IP2Geo mapping).
After
        the process is completed last octet of the IP address is set to zero.
The geographical analyses function via a database that contains the IP address information of various ISPs with
        the geographic location of the IP address included down to the city level.
The individual address of the
        Internet user is unknown.
==========

        entries) do not cause any harm to the Internet userâ€™s hard drive and do not contain any viruses.
