HIRO Media Ltd. (“HIRO“, “We” or “Us“) is committed to protecting the privacy of its users (“Users” or “You“).
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy“) has been created to inform you about how we manage, collect, store and use the information you provide in connection with our application, services and/or website (collectively, the “Services“).
Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited only to information collected by us through your use of the Services.
By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
We may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.
==========
Information Collected


Our primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Services and to enable users to enjoy the Services.
We do not rent, sell, share, or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy.
When you register to, or use, the Services or any portion thereof, we may collect and record the information you provide to us, whether through the Services or other third party services (the “Account Information“).
Personal Information


“Personal Information” means information about you that can be used to contact or identify you.
The Personal Information types collected in accordance with the Services may vary depending on the activity and may, without limitation, include your name, your third party service user identification details, your e-mail address and location (city and country).
==========
Non-Personal Information


“Non-Personal Information” is information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you.
During your use of the Services we may collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Services.
We may also invite you to share Non-Personal Information about yourself which may, without limitation, include your age or date of birth, your gender or any other information included in your application to join the Services.
If Non-Personal Information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine your non-personal information with your personal information in an attempt to provide you with a better user experience, to improve the value and quality of the Services and to analyze how the Services are used.
In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose to share additional information about yourself through the Services.
==========
Any additional image or information you provide may be publicly displayed.
Please note that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable screens or pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your e-mail address, you may receive unsolicited messages.
We cannot control who views or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Other information we may collect includes your full name, e-mail address, language, geographical location and the time zone where a Service is used, as well as information about your computer, software, platform, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC) address and connection, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and sessions viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.
We may also receive either non-personal or public information from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or data that we may use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.
==========
Use of Your Information


We use your information to fulfill your specific requests, and to send you other account-related information.
In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages regarding, among other things, new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities and events of interest.
You may at any time opt-out of any of these communications.
==========
We may also use personal and non-personal information, both individually and combined together, to better understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce our Terms of Use available at (“Terms Of Service”) , to ensure proper functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve Services and their content.
In addition, we may combine non-personal information with personal information, such as an e-mail address, to administer loyalty programs, and to tailor our offerings and/or web pages.
In addition, some of the Non-Personal Information we collect is also used for the purpose of improving the quality and relevancy of the advertisements served by HIRO or by its partners (“Retargeting”).
None of the information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual.
We may share such Non-Personal Information about you with publishers, advertisers or any other third party.

We will retain your information for as long as your HIRO account is active or as needed to provide you the Services.

Third Party Service Providers


We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services or any portion thereof, to provide the Services or any portion thereof on its behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services) or to assist us in analyzing how the Services are used.
From time to time, we employ third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide e-mail delivery, product or promotional fulfillment or other services through the Services.
When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address to those contractors.
We may ask some third party contractors, such as, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors’ needs and preferences.
To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we may tie this information to the information you provide us.
Browser Use


Note that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies.
We have no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommend that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.
==========
Disclosure of Your Personal Information


You understand and agree that we may be required to disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, including, but not limited to a subpoena, statute, search warrant, or court order, or to protect our, or a third party’s, property and rights, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Services or to protect our operations or users.
Additionally, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
==========
Cookies


Like many websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information.
A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies may be sent to a user’s computer or a mobile device when such user accesses or views a Service.
Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Services easier to use.
Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your computer or mobile device.
Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
Note however, that if you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Services.
==========
Links


The Services may contain links to other websites or applications.
The fact that the Services link to a website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that we endorse or authorize that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party.
If you click on a link to a third party website or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave our website which you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the website or application linked to.
These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you.
==========
Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as us.
You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit before providing any personal information.

Security


We have made reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.
However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
