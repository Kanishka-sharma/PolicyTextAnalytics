Information We Collect
We generally collect online and offline information about consumers’ interests and habits through web tracking technologies in both desktop and mobile environments, from connected television (“CTV”) devices, and from our other business partners like media publishers, data providers, supply side technology platforms and ad exchanges, and mobile app attribution companies (our “Ad Partners”).
We also collect information about you from our affiliate company’s Myspace platform.
==========
We use that information to create audience segments that we make available to our Clients to enable them to deliver targeted, interest-based advertising and to conduct analytics and research.
The Viant Services deliver the targeted advertising messages to consumers (the “Users”) on computers, mobile phones, tablets, CTVs and similar devices and enable us to report back to our Clients about the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.
==========
A. Personal information we collect directly from you
Viant generally does not collect personal information regarding individual Users through the Viant Services.
However, we may collect certain personal information via the Sites about you, for example if you contact us, such as by submitting a question, downloading a whitepaper or registering to use the Viant Services.
However, in most cases, if and/or when we obtain personal information, it relates to our current or prospective clients and business partners.
To the extent we receive personal information through our Services, we use personal information only in ways compatible with the purposes set out in this Policy, such as to respond to email communications or questions, improve our products and services, develop new products, services, and features, to provide you with promotional content and newsletters, to facilitate registration for and delivery of the Viant Services, or for billing purposes.
By voluntarily providing us with personal information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Policy.
==========
B. Information We Collect Automatically
The Viant Services collect information about your device and the ads that we deliver onto your device.
As you browse the Internet, use a mobile device or CTV, you may visit web pages, mobile applications, CTV channels or applications, or other online media that make use of the Viant Services.
When this happens, your browser, device, or CTV may request advertisements from the Viant system, and Viant may collect data about this interaction, as well as about any further interaction you have with the advertisements provided by our Services and the pages or media on which such Services are utilized, such as impressions, clicks, mouse movements, viewing duration, IP address, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which you are viewing an advertisement, device type, and other Non-PII made available by the browser or device.
==========
In addition, if data being collected is from a mobile device, Viant may also collect the mobile advertising ID of the device (e.g. IDFA and Google AdID), and if data being collected is from a CTV, Viant may also collect the advertising identifiers made available by the CTV.
Viant may also receive personal data from third parties that enables advertisement optimization, independent of or in combination with the data collected by Viant, such as audience interest segments and product categories.
We may also obtain the precise geolocation (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) (“Precise Location Information” or “PLI”) of your device and may use that information to assist our Clients with targeting ads tailored to your interests.
We do not use your PLI unless our Clients and data providers have provided us with reasonable written assurances that they have provided you with sufficient notice and received your opt-in consent to use PLI for these purposes.
==========
We also combine the information collected across multiple sites, devices, and mobile apps to create interest segments that help us target future advertisements based upon those inferred interests.
We do so by establishing connections between a user’s devices and to provide interest-based advertising across devices.
Cross-device connections allow Viant to understand that a single user is accessing advertisements served or measured by Viant from multiple devices and to synchronize or target advertising messages and/or measure the performance of advertisements across those devices.
==========
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit the NAI Choices page located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the AppChoices application, available for iOS and Android (see http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices), or visit the NAI’s Mobile Choices page located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice, to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps.
Because web browsers and mobile apps have different identifiers; you will need to opt-out of each environment separately.
==========
Finally, we use Google services and other third-party services while serving you behavioral advertisements and when retargeting you with advertisements for the same product across different websites or applications.
More information on Google’s advertising cookies may be found at https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.
==========
We use the information we collect as part of the Viant Services to perform a variety of tasks, such as limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same User (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of Users, or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked.
We share this information with Clients, Ad Partners, vendors, and other companies that we conduct business with as permitted by law.
==========
Viant US LLC andand Adelphic LLC are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising by respecting the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising.
The DAA tool is located at https://optout.aboutads.info.
Viant US LLC (however, not Adelphic LLC) is also a member of Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct, and respects NAI’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising.
The NAI tool is located at https://optout.networkadvertising.org.
==========
These tools enable you to opt out from receiving interest-based advertising from many of our Clients and Ad Partners.
We offer an “opt-out cookie” to block the placement of Viant’s behavioral advertising cookies on your system for five years from the time you opt out.
When we detect our opt-out cookie on your browser, we do not serve you with interest-based advertising on the browser or device from which you have opted-out, or on the browsers or devices that we believe are linked to your opted-out browser or device.
However, if you delete your cookies or begin using a new browser or device, you will need to opt out again.
Browser settings that block all cookies may prevent the opt-out from operating correctly and certain privacy software may delete the opt-out cookie or cause it to function incorrectly.
==========
Furthermore, the opt-out cookie is not effective on devices that do not accept or otherwise support cookies, such as iOS based mobile devices, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected devices and applications.
You may install our opt-out cookie by clicking the button below:
Opt-out for Mobile Applications
To opt-out of interest-based advertising for the mobile applications on your current device, the method of opting out depends on the type of device you have.
==========
In some cases, for older devices, it may be necessary for you to provide your device ID to opt out
Opting out on Apple iOS Devices: On iOS 6.0 and 7.0, you can select a setting that enables you to limit ad tracking.
You can do this by clicking on Settings -> General -> About -> Advertising and setting the Limit Ad Tracking function to ‘ON’.
Alternatively, you can go to Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising and set the “Limit Ad Tracking” function to ‘ON’.
On iOS 7.0, go to Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising and set the “Limit Ad Tracking” function to ‘ON’.
==========
Opting out on Android Devices: In Android devices with Google Play Services 4.0 and higher, You can opt out of interest-based advertising services by opening the Google Settings App, then clicking on Ads (under “Services”) and turning on the “Opt out of interest-based ads” function.
Please also visit the NAI’s Mobile Choices Page located at https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices for additional detailed instructions on how to use the advertising choice mechanisms for various devices
Opting out for CTV: To opt-out of interest-based advertising for a CTV (i.e., smart televisions, and/or digital media streaming devices), visit the NAI Internet Connected TV Choices page, located at https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/, for detailed instructions on opting out on various TV streaming devices and smart TVs.
When you opt-out of interest-based advertising through the Viant Services (as described above), we stop sharing your information with our Clients and Ad Partners.
==========
That does not mean you will no longer receive advertising on the internet.
However, it does mean that the display advertising you see will not be behaviorally targeted by us to your interests or preferences, so long as the opt-out cookie remains in place.
Further, except for the specific restrictions noted above, our opt-out cookies do not otherwise prevent us from continuing to collect, maintain or use information as described herein, including for non-personalized advertising purposes (such as ad delivery and reporting) on your opted-out browser or device or on linked browsers and devices.
Cookies and other Web Technologies
In operating the Viant Services and Site, we use a technology called “cookies,” which are small text files that our Site serves to your browser when you access the Site or that some of our Clients and Ad Partners serve to your browser when you engage with them.
Our cookies, pixels, and other tracking mechanisms collect and store audience segments, help provide additional functionality to the Viant Services and Site and help us analyze usage more accurately.
Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer.
==========
However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
We do not currently support the Do Not Track browser option.
==========
We also use an advertising identifier created by your mobile operating system to store information on our servers and later retrieve it to provide the Viant Services.
The Android Advertising ID and Apple iOS’ IDFA are examples of advertising identifiers.
For more information about advertising identifiers, please check the settings of your mobile device.
You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.
==========
Log Data
We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services, which we refer to as “Log Data.”
For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, or interact with our email notifications, we may receive information about you.
Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information.
We use Log Data to operate our Services and optimize the performance of our Services.
==========
C. Information We Collect about you from Our Clients, Affiliates and Ad Partners
Our Clients, Ad Partners, and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, IP address, device type, operating system, hashed email address, or hashed mobile ID (e.g., Apple IDFA or Android advertising ID), as well as location-based data such as Wi-Fi, cell tower, GPS or diagnostic location information, contextual information, and demographic information including age, gender and zip code.
Information we obtain from these third parties (including our affiliates) about you may be appended to information that we otherwise have about you for the purposes of targeting advertisements.
For example, we match hashed versions of mobile IDs to data that we have de-identified (made pseudonymous) about you that resides in our platform in order to target advertising to you based on your device activity, inferred interests and location information.
==========
We use your appended data to create interest-based segments, including non-sensitive health and financial related interest-based segments as part of our services, including general interest-based segments such as “Health::Medical Centers” and “Finance::Insurance,” and custom interest-based segments such as “Health::Dieting::Acai Berry” and “Health::Contact Lens.”
You may click here for a list of our general health and financial related interest-based segments.
We also use your appended data to create interest-based segments for political campaigns.
We do not use interest-based segments to determine credit worthiness or for insurance underwriting or employment eligibility purposes.
==========
In the process of serving an advertisement to a device, we, or our partners, may decide to serve an ad based on one or more audience segments associated with that device, and the audience segment we believe may be associated with that device.
Where Viant is able to use this and other information to infer that one browser or device likely belongs to the same User or household, the Viant Services may consider those browsers and devices “linked” for purposes of ad serving and interest-based advertising.
This linking process is sometimes referred to as creating a device graph.
As noted in Section 2(B) above, because web browsers and mobile apps have different identifiers, if you choose to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, you will need to opt-out of each environment separately.
==========
When you use third-party apps, websites or other products integrated with the Viant Services, they may collect information about your activities, subject to their own terms and privacy policies.
Those companies’ use of cookies and other data collection technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, and the terms of this Policy do not apply.
Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select Clients and Ad Partners, but those parties are not authorized to access Viant cookies.
