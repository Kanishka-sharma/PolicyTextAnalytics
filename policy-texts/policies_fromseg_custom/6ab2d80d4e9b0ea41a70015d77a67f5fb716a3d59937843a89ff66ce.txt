 Undertone Networks Privacy Policy
Updated June 2008
Undertone Networks is committed to protecting the privacy of online consumers.
This notice explains our online technology and information-collection practices.
Privacy Compliance
Undertone Networks does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from users.
Undertone Networks has worked with our third-party ad-serving technology provider, ZEDO, Inc., to ensure that we adhere to the privacy guidelines created by the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).
==========
ZEDO, Inc does not collect any PII on users, and it uses cookies in the ad-delivery process only.
For more information about ZEDO's privacy policy, please refer to: http://www.zedo.com/company/privacy.htm.
Information Collection
 Undertone Networks collects anonymous information through the use of cookies and pixel tags, which are industry standard technologies, used by many major web sites.
No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.
==========
•CookiesA cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive.
When a user views an Undertone Networks online advertisement, he or she is assigned a number, known as a cookie, that is unique but that does not identify the user personally.
The cookie is recorded and stored on the user's computer in the Web browser's cookie file.
•Pixel TagsTo make certain that ads served by Undertone Networks are targeted correctly, partner websites in the network place Undertone Networks pixel tags on their sites.
These tags are not personally identifiable nor do they collect personal information.
They are used to match visitor browsing behavior to a segment profile designated for targeting ads to visitors.
==========
When you are on one of our customers websites (includes advertisers and Web site owners), the website, using cookies (see below), collects certain non-personal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type (for example, Internet Explorer or Mozilla) and your operating system (for example, Windows or Macintosh).
In addition, Undertone Networks collects information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the websites, the content areas or pages of the websites that you visit (for example, ''auto section'' or ''entertainment section''), ads clicked on, and other click-stream data, none of which will include personal information about you.
Usage of Data

Undertone Networks uses the anonymous information it collects to customize the advertisements that consumers see on participating web sites and to analyze if the advertising resulted in a desired action such as sales.
==========
This is sometimes referred to as Online Preference Marketing (“OPM”) or Behavioral Targeting.
In order to serve visitors appropriate ads, Undertone Networks will temporarily assemble non-personal, behavioral and technical information to create very large audience segments.
These segments represent data that has been aggregated into large anonymous groupings.
An example of this usage is listed below:
A consumer visits automotive content sites in the network of Undertone partner sites and a cookie is stored on their computer.
This data allows Undertone to place the consumer into the “car buyer” segment.
This segmentation is anonymous and does not include any PII information about the consumer.
The segment data would then be utilized to show an advertisement for a new car offer, for example, to the same consumer when he or she visits another website in the Undertone network.
Segment assignments may change over time as new web surfing data is collected and utilized.
Undertone Networks ad server stores all anonymous data (non PII) in user cookies and not on any servers.
==========
These cookies have a lifetime of 1 year and can be blocked or deleted by users using the Opt Out methods described in this policy.
Disclosure of Information

Undertone Networks does not provide any personal information to marketers when you interact with or view a targeted ad.
The user information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our service is not shared with any third party.
At the same time, our advertiser customers cannot correlate or merge any network segment information with information that they may collect, process, or store in connection with their site, including personal information except in compliance with the applicable Self-Regulatory NAI Principles, and such customer's privacy policy.
PII may be utilized by advertiser customers at a later time, as part of their customer relationship management (CRM) programs, for example.
Opting Out

Undertone Networks belongs to and conforms to the standards and principles of the  Network Advertising Initiative, which enables consumers to opt out of having their behavior tracked by our technology.
