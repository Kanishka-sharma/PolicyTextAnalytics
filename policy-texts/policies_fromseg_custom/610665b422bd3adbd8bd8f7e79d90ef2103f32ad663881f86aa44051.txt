==========
A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you 
                          the first time Raw Story or its advertisers serves you 
                          an ad.
This unique number, which is stored in a cookie 
                          file on your computer, helps The Raw Story or its advertisers 
                          target ads to you.
This cookie can help The Raw Story 
                          or its advertisers ensure that we don't serve you the 
                          same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand 
                          what you like and don't like about their offerings so 
                          that they can cater better to your needs the next time 
                          you are interested in their products or services.

                          we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience 
                          by limiting the number of times you see the same ad 
                          and delivering more relevant content to you, they are 
                          not required for The Raw Story or its advertisers to 
                          deliver you an ad.If 
                            you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a 
                            simple procedure to manually delete your cookies.
