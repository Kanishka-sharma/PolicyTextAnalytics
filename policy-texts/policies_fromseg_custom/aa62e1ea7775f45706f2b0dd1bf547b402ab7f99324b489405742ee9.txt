Your privacy is very 
                          important to us.
Simply stated, our policy is to collect

                          available to us.
When you visit MyFlorida.com, the Web server automatically 
                          recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from

This information does not 
                          result in the identification of your personal e-mail 
                          address or other personal information.
In addition, information is only gathered regarding 
                          the volume and timing of access to the site by collecting 
                          information on the date, time and pages you visited 
                          while at the site.

This information is not 
                          shared with other organizations.
Again, only aggregate 
                          information is collected, and your personal information 
                          is not identified.

                          the information will only be used for the purposes you 
                          authorized.

Some of this information may be saved for 
                          a designated period of time in order to comply with 
                          the state of Florida's archiving policies.
However, 
                          information will not be disclosed to third parties or 
                          other government agencies, unless required by state 
                          or federal law.
If information is required by law to 
                          be disclosed about you, then every effort to notify 
                          you about the disclosure in advance will be taken.
