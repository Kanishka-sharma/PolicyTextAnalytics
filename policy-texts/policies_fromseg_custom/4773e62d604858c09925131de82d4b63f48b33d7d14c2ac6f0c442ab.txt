Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information

NET Passport, to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information as described in this Statement of Privacy.

NET Passport Privacy Statement.
If you grant consent for your child to use such general audience communication services as MSN Chat, MSN Communities, MSN Messenger, or MSN Hotmail, your child will be able to communicate with other users of all ages.

Before providing consent, please be aware that such services will give your child the ability to disclose personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail, phone numbers) on his or her own.
We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.
You and your child can visit MSN's Stay Safe Online site for additional information about using the Internet safely.

==========
Use of Cookies
MSN uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
For example, if you personalize MSN's pages, or register with MSN sites or services, a cookie helps MSN to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
When you return to MSN, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the MSN features that you customized.
==========
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the MSN services or Web sites you visit.
Use of Web Beacons
MSN Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow MSN to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.
==========
MSN may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or MSN Newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon.
Web beacons are not used to access your personal information on the MSN network of sites and services; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about MSN Web site usage.
Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.
==========
MSN Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.
Use of Third Party Ad Networks
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on MSN Web pages are displayed by MSN.
In addition, MSN allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on MSN Web pages.
==========
Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer.
Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.
In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.
This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
Microsoft does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.
MSN maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating such as: 24/7 Real Media; AdForce; AdKnowledge; AppNet/admaximize/i33; Avenue A; BlueStreak.com; CFM&Z; Click Here; DoubleClick; Flycast; Interad Network; MatchLogic; Mediaplex; Sabela Media; The Thinking Media; and Vita Bella.
Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting.
You may find more information at the Web site of either the individual ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative.
==========
TRUSTe Certification
MSN is a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.
