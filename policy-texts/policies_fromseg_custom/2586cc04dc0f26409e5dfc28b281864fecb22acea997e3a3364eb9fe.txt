DATA-SHARING AND MARKETING CHOICES
As we describe in our privacy policy, we collect information to provide you wireless service, such as information about the websites you visit and the mobile applications you use on your wireless device, information about your use and purchase of our products and services, and additional details from your device such as device IDs and location data.
We and others may also use information about your usage, device, location, and demographics to serve you personalized ads, measure performance of those ads, and conduct analytics and reporting.
Data We Use for Advertising and Analytics
The type of mobile broadband, online, and device data we and others may collect and use for advertising and analytics include:
Usage and device data
Unique IDs such as device IDs, ad IDs, and cookie IDs.
See article for more information about cookies and ad IDs
Addresses of websites visited
Types of websites visited, like sports sites, music sites, etc.
Applications, content, and features used—including how much time you spent using them, and information from servers that host these apps, content, and features
Information about use of products and services, such as data and calling features, device type, operating system type, and amount of use
Demographics data
Demographics information inferred from usage and device data and location data.
For example, information that a device user is a sports lover because they visited sport sites, or that they like country music because they live in Memphis.
Demographic information from third-party sources, such as inferences about your age, household, education, and personal preferences
Location data
Information about your general location, sometimes derived from IP addresses and cellular data sessions
Precise location information based on triangulated information from the location of cell towers serving your device, used with your consent for targeted advertising.

How Ad Targeting Works
Ad targeting broadly refers to our and other advertisers’ efforts to show you online ads that may interest you.
The information used by us, advertisers, and partners we use to give you more personal ads varies, but it generally includes device and usage data, demographic data, and location data.
For example, an advertising partner may have previously recognized that you used your device to visit an online music site and infer that you are a music lover.
We may ask that the ad partners use data from people like you who use their phones to listen to music to show that group ad content about audio features, these are called “interest-based” or “targeted” ads.
==========
Or we may ask an ad broadband to recognize when you use your device to visit one of our webpages that features a type of mobile service.
They may use that data to help us display an ad about that same mobile services to you on a news site you visit.
This is sometimes referred to as “retargeting.”
==========
How Your Data is Used to Target Ads
Like most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T-Mobile works with advertising partners who collect—and with whom we may share—usage and device data, demographic data, and location data about customers and our site, as well as app visitors.
This data is used and shared to serve ads on our behalf, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.
We, along with advertising partners that deliver these ads, may place cookies and web beacons, or use mobile device identifiers and similar technologies on websites and apps—including T-Mobile’s.
==========
This technology allows them to track device activity over time across online properties.
To learn more about this technology, visit our Cookies and Tracking Technologies article.
Ad partners' use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies.
==========
T-Mobile may also use its own online advertising services in connection with these ad activities.
Your AdChoices
Ads on your mobile device, computer, or other device
T-Mobile and many of its advertising partners adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
The DAA’s AdChoices program provides users with choices regarding interest-based ads.
You can opt out of targeted ads on your mobile device or through browsers from most advertising partners by:
Clicking on the AdChoices icon on any interest-based ad
Visiting https://youradchoices.com/control

Former Sprint customers can also express their choices by:
Calling 1-855-596-2397 from your mobile device
Visiting https://www.sprint.com/mychoices
If you have a Sprint family plan, or multi-line account, you may indicate your choice for each line at https://www.sprint.com/mychoices.
==========
If you add a line or change a telephone number, you will need to update your privacy choices.
In most cases, your opt-out choice will apply only to the specific device or browser on which it was made.
You may need to separately opt out from your other devices and browsers.
Resetting your device advertising ID does not opt out your device from targeted ads, but data associated with your previous advertising ID will not be linked to your new identifier through the device.
Also, if you reset your device’s advertising ID, your previous opt-out choices made through the links above will not apply to the new ID.
To maintain your opt-out choices, you will need to opt out again.
Most web browsers can be set to reject or delete cookies, or provide notice when cookies are placed on your device.
Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu on your browser settings to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
==========
If you reject or delete cookies, certain functions on our websites may not work properly, and your ability to use some areas of our websites may be limited.
Note that certain AdChoices opt-out mechanisms described in the Advertising Choice section of our privacy policy and the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” mechanism for T-Mobile websites described in the Do Not Sell section rely on cookies to retain your opt-out preferences.
If you reject or erase cookies, the AdChoices and Do Not Sell opt-out requests you make may not function properly and you may need to opt out again.
Please note these opt-outs will not impact “contextual” advertisements like a sporting goods advertisement on a sports-themed website, or ads we place on our own websites and apps based on your activity on those properties.
==========
Social media ads
We may work with certain social media websites or platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, to serve you targeted ads as part of a customized social media campaign.
You can opt out of receiving customized ads on your social media platforms by changing your ad preferences on those platforms.
We do not control those platforms or your ad preference settings on them and recommend regularly visiting your ad preference settings to ensure that they remain accurate.
Information collected by social media platforms are subject to their own privacy policies.
==========
Analytics
Sprint and T-Mobile use usage and device data, demographics data, and location data of our respective customers and site visitors to conduct internal analytics and to create business and marketing reports that we may share with others.
For example, we may aggregate customer information across a particular region and create a report showing that 10,000 subscribers from a given city visited a particular football stadium, for example.
T-Mobile works with analytics partners who collect, and with whom we may share, certain usage and device data, demographic data, and location data about customers on our site and app visitors, to conduct analytics on our behalf and for others.
==========
For additional details on how we and others do this, please see our Cookies and Tracking Technologies article.
One of the analytics providers we use is Google Analytics.
To learn more about how Google collects and processes personal data, please visit https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
Under T-Mobile’s Customer Reporting & Analytics Program and Sprint’s Customer Reporting & Analytics Program, we use, analyze, and aggregate customers' device and usage data, demographics data, and location data, including information derived from our subscription broadband data, to prepare business and marketing reports and analytics to share with others.
We take steps to prevent these shared reports and analytics from containing data that directly identifies you.
==========
T-Mobile customers can log in to accounts to opt out of the use of broadband data for these purposes here:
Visiting https://my.t-mobile.com/account/profile/privacy_notifications/advertising
Former Sprint customers can also express these choices by:
Calling 1-855-596-2397 from your mobile device
Visiting https://www.sprint.com/mychoices
If you have a Sprint family plan, or multi-line account, you may indicate your choice for each line at https://www.sprint.com/mychoices.
If you add a line or change a telephone number, you will need to update your privacy choices.
While we allow opting out of the use of broadband data for these reporting and analytics purposes, we continue to use broadband data for other internal purposes, and we may continue to use other device and usage data, demographics data, and location data from other sources, like our apps and websites.
In the past for Sprint customers, certain usage data, demographics data, and location data was shared with others in a way that did not directly identify you or your location to allow others to produce limited business and marketing reports with this data.
==========
We have discontinued this practice.
