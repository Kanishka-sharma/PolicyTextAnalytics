What personal information does VMware collect
    from me?
VMware collects information in several ways from different parts
    of our Web site.
During registration, VMware asks for your name and email address.
==========
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information,
    products, and services.
We collect visitors' contact information
    and financial information.
Contact information from the order
    form is used to send orders to our customers.
==========
Financial
    information that is collected is used to bill the user for
    products and services.
If you contact VMware we may keep a record
    of that correspondence.
VMware also occasionally asks users to
    complete surveys that we use for research purposes.
Please be aware that VMware partners or Web sites that have links
    on our site may collect personally identifiable information about
    you.
The information practices of those Web sites linked to VMware
    are not covered by this privacy statement.
==========
What are cookies and how does VMware use
    them?
VMware uses cookies to store and sometimes track
    information about you.
A cookie is a small amount of data that is
    sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your
    computer's hard drive.
All areas of the VMware site where you are
    prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you
    accept cookies.
==========
(See "What are my choices
    regarding collection, use and distribution of my
    information?"
for more information on cookies.)
Generally, we use cookies to:

    
Remind us of who you are and to access your account
    information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a
    better and more personalized service.
This cookie is set when you
    register or sign in and is modified when you sign out of our site.
==========
Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of VMware's Web
    site you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the
    aggregate.
We may use this information to better personalize the
    content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see
    on our site.
VMware also collects IP addresses for system administration.
How does VMware use my information?
VMware uses registration information to maintain customer records
  and to make using and buying from the VMware Store easier.
VMware does research on our users' demographics, interests, and
  behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration,
  during a promotion, from our server log files, or from surveys.
We
  do this to better understand and serve our users.
This research is
  compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
==========
With whom does VMware share my
  information?
VMware will not disclose any of your personally identifiable
  information except when we have your permission.
What are my choices regarding collection, use,
  and distribution of my information?
==========
VMware may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products
  and services.
Only VMware (or agents working on behalf of VMware and
  under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct
  mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these
  offers.
If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us
  when you give us your personal information.
Or, at any time, you can
  easily edit your VMware account
  information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.
You
  will need your VMware ID and password in order to access your VMware account information.
==========
You also have choices with respect to cookies.
By modifying your
  browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to
  be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.
VMware does not sell or rent user information to anyone.
However,
  if we have your prior permission, we may on occaision allow selected
  partners to send you special offers in blind mailings.

  update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable
  information?

  information  at any time by using your VMware ID and
  password.

  password.

  update your email address on the promotions mailing list or to quit
  a promotion and cease receiving promotion-related email, please
  contact webmaster@vmware.com.
How does VMware protect my
  information?
Keeping your information private is very important to us.
As with
  all information, VMware will never rent or sell your information.
==========
However, if we have your prior permission, we may on occasion allow
  selected partners to send you special offers in blind mailings.
Any user statistics that we may provide partners regarding product
  or service usage on VMware are provided in the aggregate only and do
  not include any personally identifiable information about any
  individual user.
Please note that there are several places on the VMware Web site
  where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete
  a purchase transaction or for verification purposes.
By default, any
  time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card
  number in an encrypted format.
==========
We use industry-standard, SSL (secure
  socket layer) encryption.
If you are not able to use SSL encryption,
  VMware offers you the option of providing this information in other
  ways, including by fax and over a non-secure Web connection.
How can I protect my privacy on the VMware
  newsgroups?
VMware makes newsgroups
  available to its users.
Please remember that any information that is
  disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should
  exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
  information.
VMware may, from time to time, send email regarding our
  products and services to users who have posted to our
  newsgroups.
