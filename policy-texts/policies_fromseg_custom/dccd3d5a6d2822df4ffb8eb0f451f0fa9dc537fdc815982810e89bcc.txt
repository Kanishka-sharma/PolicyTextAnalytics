AdColony’s Website Privacy Practices
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)
AdColony collects personally identifiable information (“PII”) from the Website, www.AdColony.com, when you choose to provide it to us.
==========
PII is any information that specifically identifies or locates a particular person or entity.
We receive and store any PII you provide to us.
The types of PII collected may include your name, postal address, telephone number, and email address.
For example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, by completing an online form on this website, or by signing up for our service or e-newsletter.

AdColony uses this information our business purposes, including to contact you to respond to your inquiry or to provide the service requested.
Once collected, AdColony will store your PII for as long as needed to provide services and for a reasonable time thereafter for record keeping purposes.
NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
AdColony also collects non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) from visitors to the Website.

We use this information to help manage and improve the Website.

We may utilize “cookies” to automatically collect information about visitors to the Website.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that reside within your browser and that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages on our Website are visited and by how many people.
Our cookies do not collect PII.
You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer’s or mobile device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some features of the Website.

AdColony’s Advertising Network Privacy Practices
NETWORK OVERVIEW
The AdColony Network offers a leading mobile video advertising and monetization platform that plays crystal-clear HD video at lightning speed and drives deep engagement with content.
AdColony’s proprietary Instant-Play™ video ad technology serves video ads instantly on the most popular apps in the world across Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms.
The Network provides certain services to advertisers and publishers and collects mobile device information in the process.
Generally, the Network may access, index, and cache requests made from the mobile sites, applications and device platforms (collectively, “Mobile Apps and Sites”) in order to deliver, tailor and report on the ads being run over the Network.
==========
INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE VIA THE NETWORK
We do not collect PII via the Network.
In the course of running the Network, we collect Non-PII from Mobile Apps and Sites and use such data for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to, providing publishers, advertisers and others with Non-PII information about traffic and Mobile App and Site usage on the Network.
We also collect certain information about visitors to the Mobile Apps and Sites on the Network, including device model and type, O/S version, mobile device ID, device language, the name of the Mobile Apps and Sites on which our advertisements are served, and the date/time an advertisement was served and/or clicked on the Network.
We may track that information over time and across multiple Mobile Apps and Sites and use Non-PII collected from such visitors to provide reports to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to visitors.
We may use, supplement and share Non-PII collected on the Network in our discretion for a variety of business purposes.
For example, we use such information to perform analysis aimed at improving our Network and we may also use this data to display advertising customized to visitors’ interests and preferences.
Because our services are continually evolving, we reserve the right to use the information that we collect for other legal purposes that are consistent with this Privacy Policy, even if not specifically described herein.
AD NETWORK DATA RETENTION
We retain Non-PII collected via the Network in non-aggregate form for as long as we believe it is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, but not longer than 36 months from the date of your last interaction with our Network.
After such 36-month period, we aggregate the data and use it for analytics and similar purposes.
CHOICES REGARDING THE NON-PII COLLECTED VIA THE NETWORK
AdColony utilizes technology that allows us to deliver certain behaviorally targeted advertising on our Network.
Our server may deliver certain customized information to Mobile Sites and Apps on the Network based on certain Non-PII associated with your device.
==========
If you’d like to opt-out from having this Non-PII used to tailor advertising to you, please click here and follow the instructions.
Once you’ve opted out, AdColony will continue to collect information as explained under this Privacy Policy but will no longer use your information to deliver behaviorally targeting advertising to your device.
Please note that you will continue to receive advertising after you opt-out, but it may not be tailored to your interests.
Please also note that our opt-out technology is device specific.
Therefore, if you use multiple devices you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each device.
Certain devices and device configurations may prevent our opt-out from operating correctly.

We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
