==========
How does your market research work?As part of comScore’s Unified Digital Measurement (“UDM”) market research effort, participating websites agree to deploy web tags on their sites.
Web tags are commonly used by companies to understand the visitation on their website, and the tags used by Full Circle Studies are similarly used to collect information about general visitation patterns to the participating websites.
==========
The UDM process also uses a cookie, which is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive.
The UDM effort helps websites and comScore count users who have visited and seen a web page or various parts of a web page.
==========
For the UDM effort, raw data is retained for no longer than 90 days and aggregated data is retained for no longer than 15 months.
We require that any website participating in the UDM effort include a notice disclosing that the site is using web tags and cookies to collect anonymous traffic data.
==========
The required disclosure also provides information on choices available to users regarding the use of the information collected.
Does your web tag collect or store any personally identifiable information about me?
The web tag used by Full Circle Studies for UDM is unable to identify the user visiting a page, and there is no personally identifiable data transmitted by or linked to the web tag.
Is your web tag used to target advertising?
The web tag used by Full Circle Studies does not target advertising or other content to a computer or unique device.
==========
Do you use cookies?
In order to identify browser-level behavior such as new versus repeat visitors to a website or page, we may drop cookies in support of our market research efforts.
