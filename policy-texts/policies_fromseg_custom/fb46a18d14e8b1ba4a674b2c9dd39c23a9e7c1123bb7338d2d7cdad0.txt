This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect about you at www.truveo.com (the "Website") and how we 
use this information.
This policy does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliated providers, such as, AOL.com, or third party Web sites and offerings linked to or 
otherwise accessible from Truveo.
The information collected or received by our affiliated providers and these third parties is subject to their own 
privacy policies.
Collection of your Truveo Information

Your "Truveo information" includes certain technical information gathered or received when you use Truveo.
Some of the technical information that 
may be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are 
using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), CPU type, your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); 
Internet protocol address; information about the version of service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the service; other 
information about your geographic location; and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
==========
While registering to use most of the Truveo services is not required, there are a limited number of optional services (for example, saving a video 
list) that require an "account".
Registration functionality for Truveo is provided by the AOL Network.
If you choose to "Get an Account", you 
will need to register with and provide information to the AOL Network.
You will then obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by the AOL 
Network (collectively, "Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and your Screen Name and associated services account  
will be subject to the AOL Network Registered User Agreement and Privacy Practices indicated in your registration process.
==========
If you are an AOL Member, registration is not required in order to access the optional Truveo services that require an account.
Use of Truveo 
Services by AOL members is subject to the AOL Member Privacy Policy.
How Your Truveo information is Used

Your Truveo information is used


to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available through Truveo;
to personalize the content provided to you;
to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services;
to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries;
to conduct research about your use of Truveo; and
to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest.
Your Truveo information will not be shared with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have 
consented to the sharing of your Truveo information, or except as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may use your Truveo information to present 
offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers.
These business partners and advertisers receive aggregate data about groups of Truveo 
users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you.
If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists 
publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any information you provide.
==========
The contents of your online communications, as well as 
other information about you as a Truveo user, may be accessed and disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant 
or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe Truveo is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that 
there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property or the 
rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render the service you have requested.
We may use agents and contractors in order to 
help operate the service.
If such agents and contractors have access to your Truveo information, they are required to protect this information in a 
manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services 
they are performing for Truveo.
In the event that ownership of us or the Truveo service was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your 
Truveo information may be transferred.
If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your Truveo information, we will provide notice 
about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.
Your Choices About Your Information

If you want to change your account information (for example, your Screen Name) you will need to log onto the AOL Network.
