    telephone number or e-mail address.
VMware collects personal
    information in several ways from different parts of our Web site.
On our Web site, you can order products or services, access
    support services, download evaluation products, request
    information or register VMware products.
In connection with these
    and other uses of our Web site, VMware may collect your personal
    information, such as contact information and financial
    information.
If you contact VMware we may keep a record of that
    correspondence.

    partner or other Web sites.
Those Web sites may collect
    personally identifiable information about you.
VMware is not
    responsible for the privacy practices or content of those Web
    sites.
What are cookies and how does VMware use
    them?
VMware uses cookies to store and sometimes track
    information about you.
A cookie is a small amount of data that is

All areas of the VMware site where you are
    prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you
    accept cookies.

    site you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the
    aggregate.

    content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see
    on our site.
VMware also collects IP addresses for system administration.
How does VMware use my personal
  information?
VMware uses your personal information to provide you with products
  and services, to better understand your needs and interests and to
  facilitate your use of and purchases from the VMware Store.
If you
  request something from our Web site, for example a product or

  products to you and financial information is used to bill you for
  those products and services.
Occasionally we may use your

  marketing purposes.
VMware conducts research on our users' demographics, interests, and
  behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration,
  during a promotion, from our server log files, or from surveys.
We
  do this to better understand and serve our users.
This research is
  compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
==========
Personal information collected online may also be combined with
  information you provide to VMware through other sources such as
  trade shows or seminars.
With whom does VMware share my
  information?
VMware will not sell or rent your personal information to others.
VMware may share your personal information with third parties in
  responding to your requests for products or services or product
  evaluations.
==========
Also, we may on occasion allow selected partners to
  send you special offers in blind mailings.
Generally, you will be
  given the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information
  shared with these third parties.
However, if you request or
  download an evaluation copy of any of our products, VMware may
  provide your information to third party distributors and resellers
  who may subsequently contact you directly to purchase VMware
  products or services.
In connection with these requests for
  evaluation copies of VMware products, you will not have the
  opportunity to opt out of having your information shared with these
  third party distributors and resellers.
Any user statistics that we may provide partners regarding VMware

  not include any personally identifiable information about any
  individual user.

  own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of
  VMware.
