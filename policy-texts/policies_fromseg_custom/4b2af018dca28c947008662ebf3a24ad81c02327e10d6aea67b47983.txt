In determining retention periods, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from the unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
When we no longer need personal information, we either anonymise, securely delete, or destroy it.

We respect the rights that you have in relation to your personal information, and we will respond to requests for information and, where applicable, will correct, amend, or delete your personal information.
Access to personal information.

You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information; however, this is not always possible due to legal requirements, as well as other obligations and factors.

E. COOKIES
If you are in the EU, you may opt out of certain third-party cookies that we and other websites may use for targeting through http://www.youronlinechoices.eu or www.aboutads.info.
Opting out of one or more ad networks only means that those particular members will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you.
It does not mean you will stop receiving any targeted content or ads on our Covered Sites or other third-party websites.
==========
If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opting-out pages, and you later erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, as your preference may no longer be active.

Can I withdraw my consent?
If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, you will need to delete your cookies using your internet browser settings, and disable cookies.

We take steps to ensure that the information we collect is processed according to this Privacy Statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.
==========
Verisign has networks, databases, servers, systems, support, help desks, and offices located around the world, including outside the EU.
We use service providers located around the world, including outside the EU to serve the needs of our business, workforce, and customers.

Those countries may not have the same data protection laws that the country where you initially provided the information.
When we transfer your information outside the EU to recipients in other countries (such as the US), we will either use specific contractual terms approved by the European Commission (“Standard Contractual Clauses”) or another approved data transfer mechanism, such as your consent, which will provide your personal data with equivalent protection as that afforded by the GDPR.

Verisign does not rely upon the Privacy Shield frameworks as a cross-border data transfer mechanism.

We may also verify the identity of the Authorised Agent.

==========
HOW WE VERIFY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS’ REQUESTS TO KNOW AND REQUESTS FOR DELETION
We will not respond to requests to know or requests for deletion unless we can verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty.
To verify your identity, when feasible, we will use information about you that we already have; however, on some occasions we may need to request additional information, which we will use only for the purposes of verification.
We may also use a third-party identify verification service.
==========
The information we need to verify your request will depend on the type of request, the sensitivity of the personal information requested, and/or the risk of harm to you.
Upon receipt of your request, we will notify you if we need additional information from you to verify your request.

The provision of our Covered Products and Services or the operation of our business or a third party’s business.
Personal information may be made available to Verisign businesses around the world if necessary for the provision of our Covered Products and Services, account administration, sales and marketing, customer and technical support, and business and product development, for instance.
All of our employees and contractors are required to follow our data privacy and security policies when handling personal information.
To execute a contract that we have entered into with a third party or you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.

To protect your interests (or someone else's interests).
==========
When needed in the public interest or for official purposes.
In connection with the sale, merger, acquisition, or other reorganisation of our business.
==========
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers.
It is Verisign's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
Compliance with legal obligations and protection of Verisign and others.
Specifically, we may be required to use and retain personal information for legal and compliance reasons, such as the prevention, detection, or investigation of a crime, loss, or fraud.
We may also use personal information to meet our internal and external audit requirements, and as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate: (i) under applicable law, which may include laws outside your country of residence; (ii) to respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence; (iii) to enforce or apply our contractual rights; and (iv) to otherwise protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons.

Marketing purposes.
Specifically, we may use your personal information (including cookies – for more information on how we use cookies, please see Section IX below) to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
==========
This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
Where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., for the provision of our services or products, the operation of our business or a third party’s business, or the marketing of products or services by us to you in circumstances where you have already bought or subscribed for similar Verisign products or services) and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override our legitimate interests.
You may receive marketing communications from us if you have purchased products or services from us, we have identified similar products or services that may be relevant for you and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
We will get your express opting-in consent before we market products or services to you that are not similar to products or services you have purchased from us before, or if we share your personal information with any company outside the Verisign group of companies for marketing purposes.
==========
You can ask us or any third party to stop sending you marketing messages at any time.
If you receive a marketing communication from us, the communication will contain an option to opt out of further communications.
If you receive a marketing communication from one of our business partners, or from social media providers, you should opt out with that entity directly.
==========
You can also contact us at any time to opt out using the details given at the end of this Privacy Statement.
We may disclose your personal information to entities other than Verisign for business purposes.
When we disclose personal information, we do so in accordance with our data privacy and security requirements.
Please see Section I.C. for more information about these types of disclosures.
==========
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, including where we reasonably consider that we need to use it for a reason that is compatible with the original purpose.
Should we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you as required by law.
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.
