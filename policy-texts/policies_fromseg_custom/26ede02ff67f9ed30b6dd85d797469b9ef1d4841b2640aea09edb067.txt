The MyBrowserBar Privacy Policy applies to your use of our Toolbar (“Toolbar”), which is built and maintained by Spigot, Inc. (“We”).
We care about your privacy and will never collect personally identifiable information or monitor usage on an individual level.
We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
==========
We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a prominent notice on our site.
When there is a material change to the reference notices or the toolbar software, we will notify you though a pop-up in your web browser.
At that point you will be given the chance to accept the new changes and update the toolbar or decline the new changes and do not update the toolbar.
Uninstall instructions are also presented at this point.

The information We collect is for basic reporting purposes only, and includes the following:
a) Date and time of installation
b) Date and time of un-installation
c) Originating IP address and the user’s country at time of installation/un-installation
d) Toolbar status in Internet Explorer or Firefox (i.e. if a Toolbar is hidden or displayed in the browser)

f) Toolbar version at time of installation

We do not monitor the web pages you visit.
==========
When you perform a search, your search may be sent through our servers in order to optimize the search result.
This will record the following anonymous usage information:
a) Date and time of search
b) Originating IP address
c) Partner / Channel ID of your Toolbar

In addition, your web browser will communicate to us the same information it gives to every web server on the Internet.
This could include information such as your computer hardware and software attributes, cookies for our site, and the URL of web page you are requesting.
Information we collect from you is used on an aggregate basis and for reporting purposes only.
For example, we measure the total number of Toolbar installations per month in order to pay our partners, the total number of Toolbar searches conducted per month to measure growth patterns, the number of Toolbars used in Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox per month to study browser trends, and so on.
All information is collected in aggregate and never measured on an individual basis.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
==========
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We take privacy seriously and will only use the information you are providing for the sole purpose of following up on your request.
We will not share your information with third parties unless legally required without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
