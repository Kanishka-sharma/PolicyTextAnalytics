                    4.0 delivery system.
Internet consumers should make note of 
                    this system and the type of information it collects.
Internet Consumer Data Collected by 
                    Pennyweb, Inc's 4.0 Delivery System.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

                    served advertisements
                    originating from Pennyweb's 3.0 delivery system, Pennyweb, 
                    Inc. does not collect any personally identifiable information 
                    regarding the consumer who clicked on the ad (e.g. name, address, 
                    social security number, e-mail address).
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)
                    When an Internet consumer clicks on one of Pennyweb, Inc.'s 
                    served advertisements
                    originating from Pennyweb's 4.0 delivery system, Pennyweb, 
                    Inc. does collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
                    (Non-PII), which is used solely for the purpose of
                    delivering ads and reporting results.
==========
This is known in the 
                    industry as "ad delivery and
                    reporting data".
Ad delivery and reporting data includes 
                    type of browser, operating
                    system, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and 
                    time of when an ad has been responded to.
==========
Pennyweb does not 
                    use the collected NPII for any other purpose than to deliver 
                    ads and report results, and by itself this information cannot 
                    be used to identify any specific user.
Pennyweb, Inc. retains 
                    all ad delivery and reporting data indefinitely, for accounting 
                    and auditing purposes.
Consumer Choice Concerning Data Collection
Use of Cookies - Remove and Disable option
When a consumer views an ad served by Pennyweb's 4.0 delivery 
                    system they are issued a "Cookie".
==========
A cookie is a 
                    tiny file that contains a number.
The number is recorded and
                    stored in Pennyweb's system; the cookie is stored on the consumer's 
                    computer in the web browser cookie file.
Pennyweb only uses 
                    this information for delivering ads and reporting results.
Cookies do not harm Internet consumers' computers and cannot 
                    collect any information about a person, only their computer.
Because Pennyweb only collects information for delivering 
                    and reporting advertising,
                    consumers who wish to "opt-out" or refuse a Pennyweb 
                    cookie being issued to their
                    computer have the option of disabling cookies within their 
                    web browser software, which means that they will no longer 
                    receive cookies without their approval.
Internet consumers 
                    can also delete any cookies that currently reside on their 
                    computer.
Internet consumers should refer to their respective 
                    browser's user manual for instruction on performing this action.
It is important to note that disabling the cookie option in 
                    your web browser will block your computer from receiving cookies 
                    from all websites using this technology.

                    access clients' personally identifiable information.
In the 
                    event that a client of Pennyweb, Inc. wishes not to have their 
                    personally identifiable information used for the aforementioned 
                    purposes, those clients can elect to opt-out.

                    data provided by individual clients will be kept in strict 
                    confidence by Pennyweb, Inc. and will be treated with the 
                    same level of respect and care that Pennyweb, Inc. treats

                    to time, provide such information to certain third-party administrative
