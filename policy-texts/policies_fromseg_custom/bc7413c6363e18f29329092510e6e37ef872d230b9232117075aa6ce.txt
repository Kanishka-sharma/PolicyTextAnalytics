D. MEMBERSHIPS & FEES 
Purchases, taxes, and fees.
You are responsible for paying any amounts due, including any applicable taxes, when you make purchases on TpT.
When you purchase on TpT, you will be charged (in U.S. Dollars) the list price for each item as well as applicable state and local sales taxes, and any fees associated with your order.
==========
By placing an order, you represent and warrant that the billing information you’ve provided is accurate.
TpT enables Sellers to collect sales tax on applicable orders in states where they have designated an obligation.
TpT is not responsible for the information provided by our Sellers and does not guarantee the accuracy of sales tax calculations.
In addition, as set forth in section 5 below, for states with applicable marketplace collection laws, and for certain other states in which TpT has received permission (including by having entered into a collection agreement), TpT will calculate, collect, and remit applicable sales tax.
Where sales tax applies to your order, the amount of tax due will be estimated at checkout and may differ from the final sales tax amount that will be charged when your order is processed.
Where sales tax is not collected, you are solely responsible for the payment of any use tax that may apply to your purchase and you may be required to file a use tax return to pay such taxes.
==========
Buyers.
Joining as a Buyer is free.
==========
Buyers may, at any time, and after paying any applicable fees, upgrade to a Seller Membership.
Sellers.
TpT offers multiple Seller Membership options.
Each Seller Membership has different features and privileges, Payout Rates, and Fees.
==========
“Fees” include (1) membership subscription fees charged each membership term (“Membership Fees”), and (2) fees charged per Resource sold (“Transaction Fees”).
“Marketplace Payout Rate” is defined as the percentage of the sale price you earn for each Resource you sell through the TpT Marketplace.
For clarity, Resources sold or accessed through TpT School Access (as further described in the TpT School Access Supplementary Terms for Sellers) are not considered sold through the TpT Marketplace.
==========
Marketplace Payout Rates may vary depending on the type of Resource and your Membership level.
The applicable Marketplace Payout Rate is applied only to the sale price of each Resource at the time sold, before any Transaction Fees or Shipping Charges are applied.
The remaining amount of the sale price is retained by TpT as a service fee.
See Section 5 for additional information on Marketplace Earnings and Payouts.
==========
The Fees and Marketplace Payout Rates for each Seller Membership are defined in our Seller Fees and Payout Rates Policy which is incorporated as part of these Terms.
If you participate as a Seller in TpT School Access, please see our TpT School Access Supplementary Terms for Sellers for applicable School Access Payout Rates.
For any membership for which a Membership Fee applies, your membership will automatically renew each term unless you cancel the renewal.
Click here or contact us to learn how to cancel your renewal.
==========
We may, in our discretion, make changes to the Memberships we offer, the privileges and features available to each Membership, as well as the Fees and Marketplace Payout Rates associated with each Membership at any time.
In advance of any Fee increase or change in Marketplace Payout Rates, we’ll notify all affected Users at the email address associated with the account in accordance with these Terms.
==========
Changes in Marketplace Payout Rates will be applied to all affected Sellers as of the stated effective date of the change, irrespective of any individual Seller’s Membership Fee renewal date.
Any increase in Membership Fees will be applied only to renewals taking place after the change goes into effect.
Sellers are responsible for any other fees or costs they may incur and for paying any applicable income, sales, or other taxes they may be subject to as a result of using our Services.

==========
Any suspension or discontinuation in our Services may mean that that your Account, including any Resources or other materials you may have purchased from our Services, and any Resources or Communications (collectively “Content “) you may have uploaded to our Services, may not be available to you or to other Users.
We are not liable to you for any impact a change, suspension, or discontinuation of our Services may have including the loss of access to any Resources that you’ve purchased, or loss of income from your temporary or permanent inability to sell Resources through our Services.

We may remove Feedback for any reason, at any time, without notice and we may ban a Member from leaving future Feedback.

==========
Resource Licensing Policy
TpT Sellers own their Resources and give you certain rights to use them for limited purposes.
This section describes the agreement between you and the Sellers you purchase from, and lets you know what’s OK to do with Resource licenses you buy on TpT and the types of licenses available.
A.
==========
IN GENERAL
License.
TpT Sellers own and maintain the intellectual property rights in their Resources and grant Members licenses to use such Resources for limited use as described in this section.
==========
When you purchase a Resource, you’re purchasing a license to use the Resource in accordance with the terms of this Resource Licensing Policy.
All downloadable and digitally consumed Resources can only be used in accordance with a license, which can either be an “Individual License” or a “Classroom License.”
Your use of any Resource, regardless of license type and whether the license is purchased by you, transferred to you by your Organization, or purchased for you as a gift or on your behalf by your school or other entity, is subject to this Resource Licensing Policy and other terms set forth in these Terms.
==========
You agree to comply with the terms of this Resource Licensing Policy as well as any additional terms the Seller provides in the Resource Listing, to the extent that such terms do not conflict with these Terms.
In the event of any conflict between this Resource Licensing Policy and a Seller’s terms, this Resource Licensing Policy will govern, except that Sellers may grant certain additional rights to their Resources.
==========
B. INDIVIDUAL LICENSE
An Individual License is a license that may only be assigned to a single specific individual user (“Assignee”) (e.g. one specific teacher) for that Assignee’s lifetime use.
Individual Licenses are non-transferable and may not be used by or reallocated to a different Assignee (for example, a teacher who purchases an Individual License can use such Resource, in accordance with this section, for her or his lifetime but cannot transfer use of such Resource to another teacher after her or his retirement).
Except as otherwise stated in these Terms (such as in the “Limitations on Access” section set forth below), with an Individual License, the Seller grants to the purchasing Member, for use by one Assignee, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide, limited license to use the Resource for the purposes and under the conditions described below.
==========
The Seller may grant additional rights at their discretion.
If you purchase an Individual License, the Seller permits you to:
Assign use of the Resource to one Assignee.
Once an Assignee has been designated, the license cannot be used by any other individual, but you can purchase additional licenses as needed.
For clarity, you can purchase an Individual License for yourself, as a gift for another person, or as an Organization purchasing on behalf of a teacher.
==========
In such cases, a single “transfer” of the Resource to the intended recipient Assignee is permitted, but you may not reallocate an Individual License from one Assignee to another or share the Resource with additional users unless you purchase additional licenses for each additional Assignee.
As an Assignee of an Individual License, the Seller permits you to:
Use the Resource for personal, educational, and instructional use only (“Personal Use”).
==========
This means you can use Resources for your own personal purposes, for your individual study, and to teach your students.
Print and make copies of downloadable Resources as necessary for Personal Use.
Copies may be made and provided to your students, classroom aides, and substitute teachers as necessary.
Copies may also be made for students’ parents, classroom observers, supervisors, or school administrators for review purposes only.
Hard goods and video resources may not be copied, shared, or otherwise reproduced.
==========
Deliver Resources electronically as needed by using features available through the Services or by other secure means that enable access to Resources by only your students (and as needed, their parent/caregiver) (“Permitted Recipients”).
You may not upload Resources to websites, applications, shared drives or other sites or services in a way that enables access by anyone other than Permitted Recipients.
==========
Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the Seller:
You may not use the Resource, in part or in whole, for commercial purposes.
This means you can’t sell it, use it for advertising or marketing purposes, or use it in any other way in connection with a business or profit making activity.
Except as permitted above to deliver Resources electronically to Permitted Recipients, you may not post or otherwise make the Resource available on any website, application, shared drive or other sites or services.
==========
You may not share, send, sell, sublicense, or transfer the Resource to someone else for their own Personal Use unless you purchase an additional license for each additional educator you will share it with.
Each Individual License is for use by one specific educator only.
==========
C. CLASSROOM LICENSE
Subject to these Terms and other policies made available by TpT, Organizations using TpT for Schools may have the option to purchase an upgraded transferable “Classroom License” or upgrade an existing Individual License to a Classroom License.
Classroom Licenses allow for reallocation from the original Assignee to a new user under the conditions provided in this section.
Classroom Licenses are only available to TpT for Schools purchasers.
==========
Although Classroom Licenses can be transferred from one Assignee to another in accordance with the terms of this Resource Licensing Policy, a Classroom License may be used by only one user at a time.
In order to transfer a Classroom License from one Assignee to another, an Organization must first reclaim the Classroom License from the current Assignee.
An Organization may reclaim a Classroom License in order to transfer it to a new user no more than once per calendar year.
TpT may, in its discretion, modify the frequency with which a Classroom License may be transferred, or allow additional transfers on a case-by-case basis.
Except as otherwise stated in these Terms (including without limitation the “Limitations on Access” section set forth below), under a Classroom License, the Seller grants to the purchasing Member, for use by one Assignee at a time, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide, limited license to use the Resource for the purposes and under the conditions described below.
The Seller may grant additional rights at their discretion.
If you purchase a Classroom License, the Seller permits you to:
Transfer the Resource to one Assignee (e.g. a teacher within your Organization) at a time.
Unlike an Individual License, you can reclaim the license from the Assignee and re-assign it to a different user.
==========
You may not share a Resource with multiple users concurrently unless you purchase additional licenses.
As an Assignee of a Classroom License, the Seller permits you to:
Use the Resource for Personal Use only.
==========
Print and make copies of downloadable Resources as necessary for Personal Use.
Copies may be made and provided to students, classroom aides, and substitute teachers as necessary.
Copies may also be made for students’ parents, classroom observers, supervisors, or school administrators for review purposes only.
Hard goods and video resources may not be copied, shared, or reproduced.
==========
Deliver Resources electronically as needed by using features available through the Services or by other secure means that enable access to Resources by only your students (and as needed, their parent/caregiver) (“Permitted Recipients”).
You may not upload Resources to websites, applications, shared drives or other sites or services in a way that enables access by anyone other than Permitted Recipients.
==========
Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the Seller:
You may not use any Resource, in part or in whole, for commercial purposes.
This means you can’t sell it, use it for advertising or marketing purposes, or use it in any other way in connection with a business or profit making activity.
Except as permitted above to deliver Resources electronically to Permitted Recipients, you may not post or otherwise make any Resource available on any website, application, shared drive or other sites or services.
An Assignee may not continue to use a License that has been reclaimed by the Assignee’s Organization after the license is reclaimed.
==========
D. LIMITATION ON ACCESS
Downloadable Resources.
TpT cannot guarantee continuous access to any Resource through our Service.
For example, if at any time, TpT stops hosting a Resource for any reason or you or TpT terminates, suspends, downgrades, or otherwise limits your Account or access to TpT’s Services, your ability to access the Resource through our Services may be terminated.
It’s your responsibility to maintain and store a copy of downloadable Resources on your device to ensure future access.
==========
Digital and Video Resources.
If you purchase access to a Resource in the format of streaming video or other non-downloadable formats, your license will expire if you or TpT closes your account, or if TpT stops hosting the Resource for any reason.
4.
Intellectual Property
This section describes what content on the site belongs to us and is protected as our intellectual property, what belongs to you, and the rights you grant us to use your intellectual property.
A.
==========
THE SERVICES AND THE SITE CONTENT
Except for Content uploaded or posted by Members, all other aspects of the Site and the Apps you find on our Services is owned or controlled by us.
This includes, but is not limited to, all text, graphics, photographs, logos, and other imagery, videos, user interfaces, trademarks, computer code, and other content of our Site or Apps (collectively, “Site Assets”).
==========
This also includes the design, structure, coordination, arrangement, expression, and the “look and feel” of Site Assets.
Site Assets are protected by copyright, trademarks, trade dress, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights.
==========
You may not use, reproduce, copy, modify, republish, perform, display, disassemble, reverse engineer, translate, or distribute Site Assets in any way to any person, computer, server, website, or other entity for any commercial purpose without our explicit permission.
By commercial purpose we mean that you can’t sell, license, rent, use in your own business or website, incorporate into marketing materials or presentations, or make other commercial use of our Site Assets.
==========
B. YOUR CONTENT
Rights you grant to TpT.
Some parts of our Services allow you to upload or post Content.
==========
You retain any intellectual property rights that you hold in that Content.
TpT does not take or claim any ownership (copyright, trademark, or otherwise) over your Content.
==========
When you post or upload Content to our Services, you grant to us limited rights to store, use, display, and provide access to the Content you post as necessary to provide our Services, including Digital Services (defined and as further detailed below), such as to display your Resource in your store and in search results, to make your Resources available for download, and to display and promote your Resources through our Services, through email, and ads on other sites or search engines, and through other marketing campaigns.
For these purposes, you grant to us a nonexclusive, irrevocable, perpetual (except as otherwise provided herein), worldwide, sublicensable license to exercise any copyright, trademark rights, or other rights in and to your Content necessary to provide our Services to you and our other Users.
==========
Additionally, when you post or upload Resources to our Services, you grant TpT, in its sole discretion, the right, to make your Resources available for use with digital (device-based and/or online) tools and features, as are now or hereafter, made available or enabled through the Services, such as any interactive resource tool that allows Resources to be turned into device-based interactive activities where tools and features are “Digital Services” and the Resources are “Digital Resources”.
Digital Resources can be used by Members of the TpT Marketplace and, as applicable, Schools (and School Users) using TpT School Access, and each of their respective students (collectively, “Digital Users”).
TpT may designate Resources as Digital Resources throughout the Services.
TpT may store, use, display, provide access to, and promote Digital Resources as needed to enable use of Digital Services, including for example -- adjusting, reformatting, and modifying Digital Resources for technical purposes (for example to convert them to a digitizable format and to secure the underlying content), and reproducing, displaying, and distributing Digital Resources (for example to enable Digital Users to view and use them within Digital Services and in order to make unique copies available to students as needed).
For purposes of this subparagraph, TpT will only use your Digital Resources for purposes related to preparing them for use with Digital Services and delivering them to Digital Users (e.g. the technical steps we need to take in the background), and as otherwise permitted by this Section.
==========
TpT may make Digital Resources available to and facilitate use of Digital Resources by Digital Users as further described herein.
(For the avoidance of doubt, TpT does not take or claim any ownership (copyright, trademark, or otherwise) in or to Digital Resources, and Sellers maintain the ownership they otherwise have in accordance with the Terms).
==========
Rights you grant to others.
When a Member purchases a license to use your Resource or downloads free Resources from you, you allow them to use your Resource as described in Section 3 of these Terms above, in accordance with the license type purchased by such Member and any other terms you expressly set forth in writing in connection with such Resources (as long as any additional terms do not conflict with these Terms).
For clarity, you may, at your discretion and in accordance with these Terms and any other policies set forth by TpT, grant additional rights to purchasers of your Resources, but you may not enforce limitations on such use that are inconsistent with the rights granted in Section 3.
==========
For Classroom Licenses, the list price will automatically reflect an increase over the price you set for an Individual License, and will be determined by applying a default “premium” percentage (determined by TpT) to the Individual License list price.
The default premium percentage number is subject to change by TpT.
As a Seller, you may increase the premium percentage (and therefore the overall price of a Classroom License) based on available increments up to 100%, but you may not set a premium percentage lower than the default determined by TpT.
==========
Please contact us for assistance.
Finally, you grant Digital Users the following additional rights with respect to Digital Resources notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in the Terms:
Digital Users may customize (“Digitize”) Digital Resources using functionality, as available, through Digital Services such as, but not limited to, selecting, combining and rearranging pages from Digital Resources, adding layered content on top of Digital Resources such as layered text or overwriting, interactive elements, layered images, drawings, video or audio files, and creating and appending answer keys to enable grading.
Customized elements of Digital Resources, as described in this subparagraph, are digitized content (“Digitized Content”).
Digitizing does not permit a Digital User to extract the underlying content within the individual pages of the original Resource.
Digital Users may use Digital Resources and Digitized Content for Personal Use in accordance with available Digital Services functionality and integrations, including to share or assign Digital Resources and/or Digitized Content to enable student access and use.
Digital Resources (and Digitized Content to the extent Digitized by the Seller) remain the intellectual property of the Seller.
==========
Effect of account closure or Resource deactivation.
If you or TpT closes, suspends, or otherwise limits your Account or access to the Services, or downgrades your Account to a Buyer Membership, we’ll no longer display your store page or your Resource Listings, and your Resources, including Digital Resources, will no longer be available for purchase, download, or access by Members who haven’t previously purchased, downloaded, or accessed them.
If you or TpT deletes, deactivates, or disables (as available), a single Resource Listing, that Resource, including Digital Resources, will not be available for purchase, download, or access by Members who have not previously purchased, downloaded, or accessed the Resource, and the Resource will no longer be displayed in your store or in search results.
If any of the above situations takes place, TpT will continue to store your Resource, including any Digital Resources as applicable, on our servers and will continue to make it available for download, access, or use by Members, including Digital Users, who have previously purchased, accessed or used the Resource, subject to other limitations set forth in these Terms.
TpT will continue to display your Communications unless you remove them from the Services before you go.
If you do remove them, we’ll no longer display them on our Services, but we may continue to store a copy of them in our databases.
==========
C. REPORTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY VIOLATIONS
We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect the same from all of our Members.
No Member may post any material, information, communication, data, or anything else that infringes on the copyrights, trademarks, or patent rights of someone else.
It's our policy to close the Accounts of Members who repeatedly or egregiously violate this policy.
==========
We comply very closely with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other laws governing the use of intellectual property.
Our Copyright & Trademark Policy explains our policy and process for receiving notification and removing potentially infringing material from our Services.
That policy is incorporated as part of these Terms.
5.
==========
Payment, Marketplace Earnings, & Payouts
This section provides information on making and receiving payments, our refund policy, and how and when Sellers get paid for the Resources they sell through our Services.
A. PURCHASING TERMS & REFUNDS
Refund Policy.
When you list a Resource or make a purchase on TpT, you agree to our Refund Policy.
Except as provided in our Refund Policy, all sales are considered final and nonrefundable once an order is submitted.
We may, in our sole discretion, modify our Refund Policy or, on a case-by-case basis, issue a refund for a reason that falls outside of our Refund Policy.
==========
Sellers can view a refund and any applicable refund note in their Sales Details report.
Sellers may authorize a full or partial refund for any reason by contacting us.
==========
Payment methods and currency.
We may offer a variety of payment methods to pay for purchases, such as a credit and debit card, PayPal Account, School Purchase Order, Teachers Pay Teachers Account credit, or the available balance on a valid Teachers Pay Teachers Gift Card.
==========
We accept payments in United States Dollars (USD).
Cash payments and payments in other currencies will not be accepted.
We may change or add to our accepted payment methods at any time and we are not obligated to accept payment by any means other than those accepted at the time of your purchase.
==========
School Purchase Orders.
Payment by School Purchase Order is available only to schools, districts, and other eligible educational institutions.
By submitting a School Purchase Order, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind the purchasing entity in the transaction, and that the entity agrees to pay the total price as quoted on the TpT Purchase Order Quote, including applicable processing fees.
Invoices for School Purchase Orders must be paid in U.S. Dollars, and payment is due within twenty-one days of the Invoice Date.
Cash payments and payments in other currencies will not be accepted.
==========
Promise to pay.
When you buy something on TpT (including Resources, Teachers Pay Teachers Gift Cards, Account credit, Seller Memberships, promotional, marketing or other services which may be available to Sellers, and other products or services we may offer), you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to make the purchase and to use the payment method and billing information you’ve provided.
==========
You further agree that TpT may charge your payment method the amount due, which will be in U.S. Dollars.
We are not responsible for any additional fees you may be charged by your financial institution such as international transaction fees or overdraft fees.
Payment for certain purchases by Sellers, such as promotional services, may be collected through a deduction from the Seller’s next Payout, or by credit or debit card if your current unpaid Payout amount is not enough to cover the purchase price.
==========
Failure to pay and payment disputes.
Failure to pay as promised may result in late fees being charged, Resources being removed from your Account, Account suspension or closure, or any other action we deem necessary.
==========
If we receive notice that you’ve disputed a charge related to a purchase made from your TpT Account, we may, at our discretion, offer proof to challenge the dispute.
Pending resolution of the dispute, we may remove the purchased Resources from your Account temporarily, or, if a refund is ultimately issued, permanently.
In our discretion, we may take further action against your Account.
==========
B. MARKETPLACE EARNINGS & PAYOUTS
Marketplace Earnings.
For each sale through the TpT Marketplace, Sellers earn the applicable Marketplace Payout Rate that applies to their Membership Type (“Marketplace Earnings”).
Marketplace Earnings are reduced by the full amount of any Transaction Fees that apply, and increased by the full amount of any shipping fees charged.
Marketplace Earnings together with any other earnings Sellers can receive through our Services, such as through sales or access as part of TpT School Access, are "Total Earnings".
==========
For details on our Seller Membership options, and the Fees, and current Marketplace Payout Rates that apply to each, see our Seller Fees and Payout Rates policy.
Unless otherwise specified, Total Earnings are paid in monthly payments (“Payouts”) according to the schedule described in this Section.
Payout Account.
To issue Payouts, we work with third party companies which process and transfer funds between us and our Sellers (“Payment Services”).
To receive Payouts, Sellers must have an Account capable of receiving payments with a supported Payment Service (“Payout Account”).
You can find a list of supported Payment Services here.
==========
If you have questions about the status of your Payout Account, please reach out directly to the Payment Service you use.
If you are unable to register a Payout Account with any of the supported Payment Services, we may consider alternative means of issuing Payouts at our discretion on a case-by-case basis.
We make no guarantees about the services offered by any third party companies including the current or any future Payment Services we may support, and we are not responsible for any payment delays or other complications caused by Payment Services.
We may, at our discretion, modify the list of supported Payment Services at any time, discontinue support for an existing Payout Service, or make additional Payout options available.
==========
Schedule.
We issue Payouts on a monthly basis by the twenty-first day of the month following the month in which a sale was made.
For example, Marketplace Earnings related to a sale made through the TpT Marketplace in the month of January will be paid as part of a monthly Payout issued by February 21st.
==========
We may, at our sole discretion, withhold or delay a Payout due to any Seller who we believe to be in violation of any of these Terms.
After the matter is resolved, we will either refund the associated sale(s) or complete the Payout.
Payment Service Fees.
Payment Services may assess transaction fees when we transfer your Payouts to you.
We will deduct from your Payout an amount equal to or less than the transaction fee assessed to us by the Payment Services.
These transaction fees are subject to change at the discretion of the Payment Services.
We are not responsible for any additional fees or taxes you may incur from other third parties related to receiving or accessing your Payouts.
==========
C. SALES TAX
Except in the case of Marketplace Collection (as defined below), you may have and are responsible for the collection and/or payment of any sales tax  (including where applicable, goods and services taxes (GST) or other similar sales, use, or value added taxes)  you may owe (collectively “Sales Tax”).
TpT Sellers may have the option to use a third party service integrated with the Services (the “Tax Services”) to enable Sales Tax collection for their TpT store in jurisdictions where the Seller has designated (through their Account) a Sales Tax obligation.
==========
Seller Obligations.
By operating as a Seller on TpT, and whether or not you opt to use the Tax Services, you hereby agree to the following:
Registration.
You represent and warrant that you will use the Tax Services only to calculate and collect Sales Tax in jurisdictions where you are registered to collect Sales Tax.
==========
Remittance.
You represent and warrant that you will remit any collected Sales Tax that TpT provides to you to the appropriate taxing authorities in accordance with applicable laws.
TpT is not responsible for and will not remit Sales Taxes collected in jurisdictions not designated in the list of Marketplace Collection locations here, or for any Sales Tax collected in such jurisdictions prior to the date on which TpT first begins Marketplace Collection in such a jurisdiction.
==========
Product tax codes.
You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for designating the appropriate tax codes for your Resources.
Where TpT has provided a default product tax code designation, you understand that it’s your responsibility to verify that selection (and modify as may be necessary).
==========
Accurate information.
You represent and warrant that the information you provide for the calculation and collection of Sales Tax, including but not limited to your street address, is accurate and up to date.
No warranties.
==========
You acknowledge and agree that TpT is not responsible for and cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy or availability of the Tax Services or any other service you use to calculate or collect taxes or to determine the taxability or non-taxability of any transactions.
You further acknowledge and agree that when you access the Tax Services or any other third party tax services through the Services or on the Internet, you do so at your own risk.
==========
The Tax Services and other Third Party Services are not under TpT’s control, and you acknowledge that TpT is not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such services or resources.
You further acknowledge and agree that TpT shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such services, goods or resources available on or through the Tax Services or any other Third Party Services.
==========
Indemnification.
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TpT, its employees, officers, directors, agents, and affiliates from and against all costs, expenses, damages, judgments, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from allegations, threats, claims, suits, or other proceedings (i) brought by third parties related to your use or misuse of the Tax Services or any other tax services you use in connection with the Services; and (ii) brought by any taxing authority, related to your failure to properly remit any taxes which are owed by you in in connection with your use of the Services.
TpT’s Obligations.
Beginning on the start date identified for each respective jurisdiction, TpT will calculate, collect, and remit Sales Tax on applicable orders into the jurisdictions listed here (which may be updated from time to time) which includes states in the United States and certain other jurisdictions having marketplace or other collection laws requiring us to do so, and in certain other jurisdictions in which TpT has received permission to do so (including by having entered into a collection agreement) (“Marketplace Collection”).
You hereby authorize and permit TpT to engage in Marketplace Collection on your behalf and you understand that TpT may cease Marketplace Collection for all or any portion of Sellers with respect to a jurisdiction i) if TpT becomes no longer legally permitted to engage in Marketplace Collection in that jurisdiction, or ii) where TpT is not legally required to engage in Marketplace Collection, at TpT’s discretion.

TpT School Access Supplementary Terms for Sellers
Update: These terms were updated on 1/12/2021 to reflect updates to our Seller enrollment process for School Access.
==========
There will be an enrollment period each year during which Sellers can take an action (by filling out a form) to change their enrollment status or keep their current status by taking no action.
See details in Section 1 below and visit TpT U to find important dates for this year's open enrollment period, how to check and change your enrollment status, and other information about participating in School Access.
==========
Last Updated: 1/12/2021
TpT School Access (“School Access”) is a TpT Service for educational institutions and organizations (“Schools”) and which enables a School’s administrators and staff (“School Users”) limited access to a subset of Resources from the TpT Marketplace (“School Access Catalog”) on a subscription basis ("School Access Subscription").
Subject to these TpT School Access Supplementary Terms for Sellers (“SA Terms”), TpT Sellers may have the opportunity (as eligible) to participate in School Access by having their Qualifying Resources (as defined below) included in the School Access Catalog.
Participating Sellers are "SA Sellers".
==========
These SA Terms contain additional terms specific to School Access, are incorporated into and made part of our Terms of Service and apply to all SA Sellers in addition to our Terms of Service.
Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in these SA Terms have the meaning assigned in the Terms of Service.
Where there is a conflict between these SA Terms and the Terms of Service, these SA Terms will govern only to the extent of such conflict and only for matters relating to School Access.
For the avoidance of doubt, where these SA Terms are silent, the relevant provisions in the Terms of Service will apply.
1.
==========
Seller Eligibility and Option to participate.
a. Seller Eligibility.
==========
To be eligible to participate in the School Access Catalog you must, as of the start of the next Enrollment Period (defined below) have i) an active Seller Membership in good standing and ii) at least one Qualifying Resource (as defined below) (each such Seller an "Eligible Seller").
This means that you are not an Eligible Seller if you join or upgrade your existing Membership after the applicable Enrollment Period begins, if you have an existing Seller Membership but do not have any Qualifying Resources as of the beginning of the applicable Enrollment Period or otherwise determined ineligible by TpT.
TpT reserves the right in its discretion to change these eligibility requirements, make eligibility determinations on a case by case basis, and to allow or deny participation in the School Access Catalog to any Seller, whether or not an Eligible Seller, at any time, for any reason.
==========
b. Effect of Participation.
Eligible Sellers who become SA Sellers in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section will, for the duration of the next Enrollment Term and successive Enrollment Terms, unless the SA Seller changes their participation status during a future Enrollment Period, i) have their Qualifying Resources (as defined below) included in the School Access Catalog and ii) be compensated for any Accessed (as defined below) Qualifying Resources in accordance with Section 3 of these SA Terms.
For clarity, any Qualifying Resource of an SA Seller that is Accessed by School User during an Enrollment Term will remain accessible to such School User through the end of such School User’s current School Access Subscription, even if; (A) such School Access Subscription ends after the end of the Enrollment Term in accordance with Section 4(b) herein, or (B) such Qualifying Resource’s status changes in accordance with Sections 2(d) or 4(c) herein.
==========
c. Enrollment Periods and Elections.
SA Sellers and Eligible Sellers can make a change to their current participation status only during annual enrollment periods as specified by TpT (“Enrollment Period”), provided that TpT may, in its sole discretion, allow Eligible Sellers to opt in to the current or next starting Enrollment Term at any time after an Enrollment Period expires.
TpT may provide notice of an Enrollment Period by email, TpT Account notification, or other communication as TpT deems appropriate.
During each Enrollment Period, existing SA Sellers may take action to opt out of the next Enrollment Term (as defined below) and Eligible Sellers who are not currently SA Sellers may take an action to opt in for the next Enrollment Term.
Actions taken during an Enrollment Period will not take effect until the start of the next beginning Enrollment Term.
For the avoidance of doubt, unless the SA Seller or Eligible Seller takes an action to change their participation status during the applicable Enrollment Period, each SA Seller and Eligible Seller’s then current participation status (as of the start of the applicable Enrollment Period) will remain unchanged for the next Enrollment Term.
This means if you are an SA Seller and you take no action during the Enrollment Period, you will remain a SA Seller for the duration of the next Enrollment Term.
d. Enrollment Term.
Unless otherwise specified, enrollment as an SA Seller will be for successive periods of one year, each of which will start on the first of July following the Enrollment Period and will end twelve (12) months later on the thirtieth of June of the following year (each an "Enrollment Term").
2.
==========
Qualifying Resources.
a. Resource Eligibility Criteria.
A “Qualifying Resource” is a Resource (including any updates made thereto) of a supported file type, that is i) active on the TpT Marketplace and ii) free or priced up to and including fifteen dollars ($15).
==========
A Resource’s price for purposes of determining whether the Resource meets the criteria of Section 2(a)(ii) above and for calculating a Seller’s School Access Earnings in Section 3(a) below is the listing “discount price” if one is set, or the base list price if no listing discount price is set (“Price”).
In other words, the Price is the price that a Buyer actually pays for the Resource in the TpT Marketplace (except that the Price will not be impacted by a periodic store or site wide sale discount offered by the Seller or TpT).
==========
The School Access Catalog will include all Qualifying Resources of SA Sellers.
TpT reserves the right in its discretion to change these eligibility criteria, to make eligibility determinations on a case by case basis and may allow, remove or deny inclusion in the School Access Catalog to any Resource at any time, whether or not a Qualifying Resource.
==========
b. User Access.
For each Qualifying Resource, each unique School User who accesses (by download or otherwise) the Qualifying Resource from the School Access Catalog will count as one “Access.”
Each Access is only counted once per School User per School Access Subscription and is attributed to the month in which the particular School User first accessed the Qualifying Resource.
For the avoidance of doubt, additional use throughout the School Access Subscription by the same School User will not count as additional Access (and the Seller will not earn additional School Access Earnings in accordance with Section 3(a) below), but if the same School User accesses the same Qualifying Resource in a subsequent School Access Subscription, the first such access in any subsequent School Access Subscription will count as a Subsequent Access (as defined below).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, TpT may offer the ability for School Users to preview a Qualifying Resource, and any such preview will not count as an Access.
==========
c. Status Changes.
At any point during an Enrollment Term, a Resource’s status as a Qualifying Resource is determined based on whether it meets the criteria in Section 2(a) at that particular moment in time.
This means that fluctuations in Price and changes in the active status of a Resource will be reflected automatically in the status of an existing Resource as a Qualifying Resource (or lack of such status) throughout the Enrollment Term, and Resources newly uploaded by SA Sellers at any point during the Enrollment Term may be Qualifying Resources if and as they meet the criteria of Section 2(a).
d. Impact of Status Changes.
In the event that a Qualifying Resource ceases to meet the criteria in Section 2(a) at any point during an Enrollment Term (whether temporarily or permanently), for the period of time during which the Resource is no longer a Qualifying Resource, the Resource i) will no longer be available in the School Access Catalog to School Users who did not previously Access it, and ii) may remain accessible to any School Users who have already Accessed the Resource for the remainder of such School Users’ current School Access subscription.
For example, such a status change could occur if a Seller adjusts a Resource’s Price or deactivates the Resource from the TpT Marketplace.
3.
==========
School Access Payouts.
SA Sellers will be compensated (“School Access Earnings”) for their participation in the School Access Catalog in accordance with the following:
a. School Access Payout Rate.
SA Sellers will earn School Access Earnings per Access (as defined in Section 2(b) above) of each Qualifying Resource by each School User per such School Users’ School Access Subscription at the following rates (the rates to be paid for First Access and Subsequent Access through School Access will be the “School Access Payout Rate”):
First Access: For each School User’s first Access of a Qualifying Resource (i.e. the first time that a unique School User Accesses a particular Qualifying Resource through School Access, whether or not such Access occurs in the School User’s first School Access Subscription; such Access is “First Access”), the SA Seller will earn an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Seller’s applicable Marketplace Payout Rate based on the Price of such Resource at the time of First Access.
For example, if the Seller’s then-current Marketplace Payout Rate is eighty percent (80%), the Seller will earn sixty-four percent 64% (which is 80% of 80%) of the Price of the Seller’s Qualifying Resource for First Access by each unique School User during the Enrollment Term.
Subsequent Access: For subsequent Access of a Qualifying Resource by each School User (i.e. each School User who accesses the same Qualifying Resource again in a subsequent School Access Subscription year; such Access is “Subsequent Access”), the SA Seller will earn an amount equal to sixty percent (60%) of the Seller’s then-current Marketplace Payout Rate based on the Price of such Resource at the time of the Subsequent Access.
For example, if the Seller’s then-current Marketplace Payout Rate is eighty percent (80%), the Seller will earn forty-eight percent (48%) (which is 60% of 80%) for each such School User’s Subsequent Access.
The School Access Payout Rate is subject to change at TpT’s discretion and in accordance with any required notices as provided for in the Terms of Service.
b. Schedule: Subject to these SA Terms and the Payout schedule and conditions described in Section 5.
==========
B of the Terms of Service, each Seller will be paid School Access Earnings on a monthly basis to the Seller’s selected Payout Account.
School Access Earnings for each month will be included in the Seller’s Payout together with the Seller’s Marketplace Earnings, if any, from that month.
For example, Marketplace Earnings earned from sales in February along with School Access Earnings for Qualifying Resources Accessed in the month of February will be included in the Seller’s Payout paid in March.
TpT reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to withhold or deny all or any part of any School Access Earnings to any Seller if we believe that the Seller has violated any of our Terms (including these SA Terms) or policies.
4.
==========
Resource License Grant.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.
==========
B of the Terms of Service:
a. To TpT.
TpT does not take or claim any ownership (copyright, trademark, or otherwise) of Resources, and SA Sellers maintain the ownership they otherwise have as Sellers on the TpT Marketplace.
As described below, SA Sellers only license Qualifying Resources to TpT, which allows us to host SA Seller’s Qualifying Resources on a new platform and provide them as part of the School Access service.
To that end, SA Sellers hereby grant TpT a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, assignable and transferable license to store, display, reproduce (for example, in order to make Resources available throughout the School Access Services and be able to provide copies to individual School Users who Access a Resource), reformat and modify (for example, to be able to make technical changes to the file in the background, and/or to add protective layers or other content such as notices on top of a Resource to protect them against misuse), provide access to and otherwise use all Qualifying Resources to provide the School Access Services, in their current form or any future form they may take.
The rights granted in this section extend to all current Qualifying Resources and any Resource that was previously, but may no longer be, a Qualifying Resource in order to enable a School User who has already Accessed such a Resource continued use of the Resource for the remainder of such School User(s)’ School Subscription.
==========
b. To School Users.
SA Sellers grant School Users a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited license to use Accessed Resources for their individual and instructional use for the internal purposes of the School for the duration of the School User’s current School Access Subscription (which may, for clarity, exceed the Enrollment Term).
==========
c. Effect of Resource Deactivation.
If an SA Seller or TpT deactivates one or more of  a Seller’s Qualifying Resources, i) as of the date of deactivation, the deactivated Resource will not be considered a Qualifying Resource and will no longer be available in the School Access Catalog to School Users who did not previously Access it, and ii) if the deactivated Resource has already been Accessed by one or more School Users it may still be accessible to such School Users for the remainder of the School User’s current School Access Subscription.
d. Effect of Store Closure.
Subject to Section(3)(b) above, if an SA Seller’s store or Account is closed by the Seller or by TpT, i) any outstanding School Access Earnings for Access occurring up to the date the Seller’s Account or store was closed will be paid in the next monthly Payout, ii) the Seller will receive no School Access Earnings for any remaining months of the Enrollment Term, and iii) all of the Seller’s previously Qualifying Resources will be treated in accordance with Section 4(c) above.
5.
==========
No Warranties.
Participation in School Access is at your own risk.
TpT makes no, and hereby disclaims any and all warranties of any kind, express or implied.
==========
We cannot make any guarantees as to the number of Schools that may subscribe to School Access, the amount you may earn in School Access Earnings in any particular month, or any other result or impact, tangible or intangible as a result of your participation.
TpT will not be liable to you for any loss, damage, or harm you may suffer as a result of your participation in School Access.
6.
==========
Indemnification.
You are responsible for the content of your Resources and agree that you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TpT, its agents, employees, officers, and directors from and against any and all costs, expenses, damages, judgments, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from allegations, threats, claims, suits, or other proceedings brought by third parties relating to your Resource(s) in whole or in part, including any claims of infringement on the intellectual property rights, privacy or publicity rights, or any other rights of any third party.
