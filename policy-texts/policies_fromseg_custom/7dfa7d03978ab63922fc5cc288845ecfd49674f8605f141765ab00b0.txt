Security
We take precaution to protect our user's information.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line.
When our reservation order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line.
All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
==========
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.
If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an email to Customer Care.
