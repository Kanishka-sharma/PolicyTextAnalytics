Volunteered Information and How We Use It

            When you sign up for an account, we collect personal information from you including your e-mail address.
The
            information allows us to process your subscription and activate your account which may include verifying
            authorization of credit card usage before any purchase of the Screencast.com service.
Screencast.com is a service that fosters visual communication through a variety of means.
==========
Content owners may wish
            to establish a direct line of communication with viewers who post comments about their media.
As a means to that
            end, we ask that a viewer submit their e-mail address when posting comments, which we would then include in an e-mail
            notification message that the content owner has an option to receive.
At no time is the poster's email address visible
            to the public.
At no time do we ever share the poster's email address with anyone other than the content owner.
==========
When you purchase something on our site, we collect personal information from you including your credit card information
            and the e-mail address that corresponds to your Screencast.com account, and to which we will send an order confirmation.
We collect this information on web pages using encryption technology to help prevent any third party from intercepting
            the information.
We only use your credit card information for completing the purchase transaction and our billing
            provider saves your credit card information for recurring billing purposes.
We may use the information provided by our
            customers to analyze product trends based on, for example, geographic and demographic factors.
This analysis helps us
            improve the quality of our website.
When you contact us via e-mail, we may use your return e-mail address to respond when necessary or when requested to do so.
We may use the information we collect to notify you occasionally about important functionality changes to our website, new

            information, you may opt-out at any time.
We send every promotion with explicit opt-out instructions.
From time to time,
            we may randomly contact customers about participating in a survey about our products, services and/or website.
Your
            feedback helps us identify customer needs, levels of satisfaction, and improve and/or develop new products and services
            for you and your family.
These surveys are always voluntary and you may opt-out at any time.

TechSmith
            must rely on parent(s) or guardian(s) to decide which materials are appropriate for children under 13 to view and children under 13
            cannot change registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that.
Parents or guardians should follow the procedure that
            they used to enable their child's registration to review, change or delete any registration information at any time.
Parents or
            guardians, you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection
            or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request using the contact information set forth at the

SPECIAL NOTE TO CHILDREN

            If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age,
            address or e-mail address.
You do not have to give any personal information about yourself.
Remember, if you are under 13 you must
            have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to TechSmith in the past or to update your profile.
If you are ever
            unsure about anything you are seeing on this Site or a TechSmith product or service, ask your parent or guardian for help.
SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S OF CHILDREN UNDER 13

            TechSmith may collect the name of a child, parent, or guardian and online contact information in order to obtain parental or guardian
            consent from parents or guardians of Children under 13 and/or to provide parental or guardian notice by providing a link to this
            privacy policy wherever TechSmith has requested personally identifiable information from children under 13.
If a visitor indicates
            that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address.
==========
In this case, the parent
            or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until the parent or
            guardian enables the child's registration, the account is disabled.
If TechSmith does not receive the parent's or guardian's consent
            within a reasonable time, TechSmith will delete this information from its records.
If and when TechSmith has obtained verifiable consent
            from a parent or guardian, TechSmith will only ask for and collect from a Child under 13 personally identifiable information that is
            reasonably necessary for that Child to participate in any given activity online and/or use certain TechSmith's Screencast.com services.
TechSmith may also collect this information to respond to a specific request from a Child under 13.
Once TechSmith responds to a request
            from a Child under 13, TechSmith may not contact that child again and the information is deleted from our records.
TechSmith takes very
            seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13 and TechSmith may also collect this information to protect that safety.
If
            TechSmith collects information to protect the safety of your child, TechSmith will provide notice to you and TechSmith will not use that
            information for any other purpose.
You can always ask TechSmith to review or delete any of your child's information as indicated above
            and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the
            contact information set forth at the beginning of this policy.
If, however, you ask us to delete your child's information that is
            necessary to participate in TechSmith activities or use its Screencast.com services, TechSmith may have to ask your child not to
            participate in such TechSmith activities or use or benefit from TechSmith Screencast.com services.
