Cookies
We use cookies on our websites.
Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
Many websites and servers use cookies containing a cookie-ID.
A cookie-ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
==========
It consists of a character string through which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
This allows visited websites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.
A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie-ID.
==========
The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.
Through a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized for the specific user as cookies allow us to recognize our website users.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by either changing the settings of the Internet browser used, or through the consent manager on our websites.
Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time.
This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.
If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.
7.
==========
Data Protection Provisions about the Application and Use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function).
Google Analytics is a web analytics service.
==========
Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites.
A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.
Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
==========
The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.
For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application "_gat.
_anonymizeIp".
==========
By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website.
Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
==========
The definition of cookies is explained above.
With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.
During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.
==========
The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.
With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.
These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.
Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.
For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it.
This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics.
The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.
==========
If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics.
If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.
Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.
8.
==========
Right of Restriction of Processing
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:

If required for investigating the illegal use of personal data or for legal proceedings, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if appropriate, to injured third parties.
We will only do this if there are concrete indications of illegal and/or abusive behavior.
==========
We can only transfer on your personal data if this is used to enforce General Terms
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the AAX, LLC , he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller.
The employee of the AAX, LLC will arrange the restriction of the processing.
9.
How we Share Your Personal Information
If AAX LLC becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure that the acquiring organization agrees to protect personal data in accordance with the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy, and that the acquiring organization will provide notice before any data becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
10.
==========
Right to Withdraw Data Protection Consent
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.
If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the AAX, LLC.
11.
==========
Disclaimer

15.
==========
Right of Complaint to the Supervisory Data Protection Authority
Irrespective of any other administrative or judicial remedies, you have the right of complaint to a Supervisory Authority, in particular in the Member State where you are residing, working or where you suspect the breach, if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you is against the GDPR.
The Supervisory Data Protection Authority at the Controller's registered office is: Sascha Kremer Rommerskirchener Strasse 21 50259 PulheimGermany +4922385408700sascha.kremer@login.legal


16.
==========
Legal Basis for the Processing
Art. 6(1) lit.
a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.
b GDPR.
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.
Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit.
c GDPR.
==========
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.
==========
Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit.
d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.
f GDPR.
This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.
He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
17.
The Legitimate Interests Pursued by the Controller or by a Third Party
Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.
f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.
18.
==========
Period for Which the Personal Data will be Stored
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
19.
==========
Provision of Personal Data as Statutory or contractual Requirement; Requirement Necessary to Enter into a Contract; Obligation of the Data Subject to Provide the Personal Data; Possible Consequences of Failure to Provide Such Data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.
The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.
The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.
The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
20.
==========
Security and Data Integrity
Safeguarding the information you give us or we receive about you is a priority for AAX LLC.
We take appropriate security measures to protect it against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
AAX LLC has taken steps to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems and services processing personal data, and will restore the availability and access to data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
21.
==========
Changes to This Privacy Policy
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
If we change this Privacy Policy in ways that affect how we use your personal data, we will advise you of the choices you may have as a result of those changes.
