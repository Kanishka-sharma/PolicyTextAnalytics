FiksuDSP cannot use the Advertising/Device ID to identify you personally, but it does enable us to deliver relevant advertising to each mobile or CTV device.
In addition to the Advertising/Device ID, we collect information about the kind of mobile/CTV device you use (e.g., iPhone, Samsung, Roku etc.), the operating system for your mobile device (e.g., Android, iOS, Fire OS etc.), IP address, websites you may be visiting, content that you may be watching through video streaming CTV/OTT applications, the applications you download from Clients of FiksuDSP, when, how, and how often you use those applications.

The provisions of GDPR can be also applied to how data is processed and verified (more on that later) outside the European Union.
Generally speaking, the GDPR represents a new set of rules intended to empower the citizens of the European Union to control their personal information.
In accordance with the applicable laws, users are authorized to access and modify their own data held by the companies, which includes data collection, ad tracking, surveys, cookies, location data, and every other bit of a user's "digital footprint".
Users are also entitled to transmit their personal details to other organizations.
The GDPR also enforces companies to determine their in-house data security policies.
