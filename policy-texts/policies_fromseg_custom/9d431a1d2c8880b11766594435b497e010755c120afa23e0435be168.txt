Privacy Guidelines
Last Updated: April 3, 2015
Privacy Overview
Turn Inc. provides its business partners—advertisers and their agencies, website and app publishers, other ad inventory providers, and data vendors—with technologies that enable the serving and display of relevant advertisements to individuals who access a publisher’s website, mobile app, or content.
Turn advertising technology collects and uses data to help make online advertising more relevant, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
By delivering more relevant advertisements, Turn plays an important role in keeping the Internet free, dynamic, and vibrant.
That’s because advertisers will pay more when their ads are tailored to an audience’s interests, and publishers of websites and apps get more money when their audiences receive tailored advertisements instead of generic ones.
That helps publishers continue to provide great content at a great price—often free.
==========
The Turn privacy guidelines explain the various ways individuals may interact with Turn and Turn advertising technology, and the ways in which individuals may exercise control over the use of information collected by Turn.
Here’s how Turn may interact with individuals and data about them:

Privacy Guidelines: Turn Advertising Technology
Overview of Turn Advertising Technology
Turn advertising technology collects and uses data to help make online advertising more relevant, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
This plays an important role in keeping content on the Internet and within mobile apps largely free, dynamic, and vibrant by improving the relevancy of advertisements displayed throughout the Internet.
Here’s how it works: Turn advertising technology collects data that is not personally identifiable (non-PII) about the websites and apps that an individual interacts with, and the advertisements a browser or app displays.
This information may include non-PII device-specific identifiers provided by third parties.
==========
An individual may encounter Turn advertising technology when:

Turn or a business partner purchases online advertisements on a website that the individual visits or an app that the individual uses.
A Turn business partner places one of Turn’s web beacons on a website that the individual visits or uses.
An individual interacts with an app from which Turn collects data.
Turn advertising technology also offers data management services to business partners via Turn’s data management platform (DMP).
The Turn DMP enables Turn’s business partners to collect, store, and analyze non-PII about their audiences.
Turn’s business partners may use the DMP and Turn’s data collection tools to develop and name custom data segments.
Turn does not exercise control over the manner in which its business partners label their custom data segments in the DMP, but as applicable, Turn contractually requires that its business partners using the DMP adhere to self-regulatory codes offered by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or certain other industry standards.
Turn also contractually prohibits its business partners using the DMP from bringing PII or sensitive non-PII audience data into the DMP.
==========
What Information Does Turn Advertising Technology Collect?
Turn advertising technology collects and uses only non-PII, including: the device and IP address used to access the Internet; the browser or application used; which, and how many, business partner web pages have been viewed by a browser or application; search terms entered on business partner websites; referring and exit pages; and the date and time an advertisement was viewed.
In certain instances, Turn may collect and match this non-PII across devices, browsers, or applications for the purposes of providing more relevant advertising.
Turn also obtains non-PII from third party data vendors that receive such non-PII pursuant to their own privacy policies.
Turn does not collect PII via its advertising technology.
Turn advertising technology collects non-PII using cookies and web beacons as described below in Turn Use of Cookies and Web Beacons.
The Turn ID and ID Syncing
Turn associates the non-PII that Turn collects about a browser or device with a randomly-generated identifier known as a Turn ID, which itself is non-PII.
Turn uses ID Syncing (described below) to associate Turn IDs with identifiers and data from business partners and other industry participants in an effort to display relevant advertisements on a wider range of websites, apps, and content.
As part of this process, Turn may populate a Turn cookie with a new or existing Turn ID.
ID Syncing (also known as cookie syncing or cookie matching) is a common and useful industry practice that enables advertisers to use data to coordinate an advertising campaign across multiple publishing platforms and advertising service providers.
==========
As an example, suppose an individual uses a web browser to visit a merchant’s website and then leaves the website.
The merchant wants to advertise relevant products to that visitor after she leaves the website.
To do so, the merchant stores a cookie on the visitor’s browser with an ID (say “123”) and associates the ID with information about what the visitor shopped for on the merchant’s website.
If the merchant wanted to use that information to advertise on other websites, the merchant could buy advertising through an online advertising exchange or marketplace.
In order to buy appropriate advertising, the merchant would need to match the ID “123” with the ID that the exchange has assigned to the same visitor (for example, exchange ID “XYZ”).
Using ID Syncing, the merchant can know that its ID 123 is associated with the same browser or device as the marketplace ID XYZ, and the merchant may be able to show more relevant advertisements to the visitor.
==========
How Is the Collected Information Used?
Turn uses the non-PII it collects to identify the audience most likely to respond to a particular ad, to serve those ads, and to analyze trends.
This helps support the online advertising ecosystem, app and website developers, and consumers by supporting content and delivering more effective advertisements.
Turn may also aggregate this information and share it with Turn affiliates and business partners.
Turn advertising technology enables Turn’s business partners to use advertising segments to deliver relevant advertising.
An advertising segment is defined by non-PII attributes, which often includes combinations of information such as geography, age range, gender, activities, and/or interests.
==========
Turn customers may use non-sensitive health-related segments to help deliver tailored advertising.
For example, Turn customers may deliver tailored advertising regarding healthy living because a browser visited websites that are focused on health-related topics such as yoga and healthy eating.
Click here for a list of health-related segments that are made available to Turn’s business partners by third-party data providers.
==========
Cross-App and Cross-Device Advertising, Ad Delivery, and Reporting
Turn may collect and use the information and the data segments described above for cross-app advertising, i.e., advertising across browsers and apps on a single device, as well as cross-device advertising, i.e., advertising across multiple devices.
Turn also collects and uses cross-app and cross-device information for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
As described elsewhere in these privacy guidelines, Turn does not collect PII via its advertising technology, including across apps and devices.
Turn uses certain techniques to enable its advertising technology to serve meaningful advertising content on behalf of its customers and business partners across apps and devices, including cookie and ID Syncing and similar practices.
==========
Data Retention
Turn removes non-PII associated with a Turn ID from its ad-decisioning database if more than 30 days have passed since it has seen any activity associated with the Turn ID, or has delivered advertising to a computer or device associated with the Turn ID.
However, if Turn has transferred non-PII from an inactive Turn ID to an active Turn ID, the non-PII will not be deleted from the set of information associated with the active Turn ID.
Turn may retain this and other data it collects in other formats for as long as necessary for reasonable and legitimate business purposes including fraud prevention, audit and legal compliance, and billing disputes.
Non-PII associated with a Turn ID may be stored in the Turn DMP indefinitely.
==========
This information may be used to create advertising segments but is not used to deliver tailored advertising to a specific Turn ID.
Third-Party Links and Websites
Advertisements delivered using Turn advertising technology may contain links to or redirect individuals to other websites, including those of its business partners.
These websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools.
Turn encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website.
However, Turn is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies, or the content of these websites, and Turn does not exercise control over the use of any information by third party websites.
Similarly, while Turn contractually requires its business partners to adhere to applicable law and industry self-regulatory codes such as those offered by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA), and Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC), Turn does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third party.
These privacy guidelines do not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.
==========

Non-PII cannot be used to contact or identify a particular person.
Turn uses this non-PII for internal purposes such as to administer its website, improve and customize it, to help Turn understand and analyze how it is being used, and to track aggregate website usage.
Turn.com collects non-PII using cookies and web beacons as described below in Turn Use of Cookies and Web Beacons.
The data Turn collects about website visitors is subject to the data security, integrity, and transfer practices described elsewhere in the Turn privacy guidelines.
Links on Turn.com to Third Party Websites
Turn.com may include links that connect individuals to other websites, including those of its business partners.
Those websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools.
==========
Turn encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website.
However, Turn is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such websites, and Turn does not control the use of any information by third party websites.
Turn contractually requires that its business partners adhere to applicable law and industry self-regulatory codes such as those offered by the NAI, DAA, eDAA, and DAAC.
Turn does not control the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed on an advertisement by a third party.
These privacy guidelines do not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.
==========
Updating or Deleting PII Collected Through Turn.com
Turn allows individuals to request a summary of the PII they have provided through turn.com to request an update to or deletion of inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individuals’ privacy in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
To update or delete any inaccurate PII provided to Turn, send a request to privacy@turn.com.
Turn will process the request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.
==========
Privacy Guidelines Applicable to Both Turn.com and to Turn Advertising Technology
Turn Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
Turn uses cookies (small text files maintained by a browser, which may be session-specific or persistent) in connection with both its advertising technology and website.
Cookies used on Turn.com: Turn uses cookies to help administer its website.
For example, Turn may use cookies on its website to track browsing sessions or facilitate logins.
Cookies used in connection with Turn advertising technology: Turn also uses cookies to help it better understand the effectiveness of particular advertisements.

Turn’s cookies may also help control the number of times a browser or application is served an advertisement.
==========
For more information about cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies.
If Internet browser settings are used to “clear” or delete cookies, this may inadvertently delete cookies that have been set by websites to honor an “opt-out” status (including the Turn opt-out cookie).
If you delete Turn cookies from your browser, that action only deletes the cookies in your browser and does not send any information to Turn.
The next time Turn is provided the opportunity to set cookies in your browser or app (usually when Turn places an ad), it will do so.
The Turn ID associated with one or more of the Turn cookies may or may not be different than the Turn ID associated with previously deleted Turn cookies.
If you delete Turn cookies from your browser, that action also has no impact on the non-PII previously collected and stored by Turn.
Turn will retain the information as described in the Data Retention section.
If Turn is able to associate one Turn ID with other Turn IDs (for example, through the receipt and use of a separate identifier and/or ID syncing), Turn may transfer the non-PII associated with one Turn ID to the other Turn IDs.
==========
Turn also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns on its website and through Turn advertising technology.
The use of a web beacon allows Turn to record that a particular device, browser, or application has visited a particular webpage, along with additional non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.
For more information about web beacons, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/faqs/beacons.html.
Data Security
Turn has implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in its care, both during transmission and once Turn receives it.
This includes, but is not limited to, the use of encryption.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is entirely secure, however.
==========
Therefore, while Turn strives to use commercially reasonable means to protect information, Turn cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Data Integrity
Turn processes information in a way that is compatible with, and relevant to, the purpose for which it was collected.
To the extent necessary for those purposes, Turn takes reasonable steps to ensure that any information in its care is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.
==========
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
Turn may share information, including any PII collected via its website, with trusted third parties who provide services for Turn.
These third parties are prohibited from using the information Turn provides for purposes other than performing services for Turn.
Turn may also share non-PII, including data collected across applications or devices, with business partners.
Similarly, Turn may enhance the non-PII collected via its advertising technology with non-PII collected from business partners.
==========
This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually.
Turn may disclose information, including any PII collected via its website, to third parties when Turn reasonably believes it is obligated to do so by law, and to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
Finally, Turn may transfer information, including any PII collected via its website, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
