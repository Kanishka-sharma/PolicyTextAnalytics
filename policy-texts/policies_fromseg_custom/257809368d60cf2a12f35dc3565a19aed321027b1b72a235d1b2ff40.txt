How and When Information is Collected
Generally, you can browse through our Website(s) without providing us with any personally identifiable information about yourself.
However, as you navigate through our Website(s) and/or use our Services, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, unique IDs, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream).
Your internet browser automatically transmits some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer or mobile device is currently using; the date and time you access the Website and the pages that you access while at the Website.
This information is used by us for internal business purposes, to analyze trends and to improve upon our Website, products and Services.
Other anonymous information may be collected from your computer or mobile device through tracking technologies that we employ on our Websites such as cookies, unique IDs and internet tags or web beacons.
You may set your browser to notify you when a tracking cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but please be aware that certain features of our Website(s) may not work without cookies enabled.
LogMeIn also collects and uses the personal information that you proactively provide to us when you:
    •   Register an account with us to use any of our Services on a paid or free/trial basis;
    •   Register for any webinars, seminars or similar online programs or events hosted or sponsored by LogMeIn;
    •   Enter any of our contests, sweepstakes or other promotions;
    •   Respond to any LogMeIn surveys, emails, questionnaires or similar online forms; or
    •   Contact us to request information or otherwise correspond with us.
We may also receive personal information from our business partners and vendors and, so long as it has been collected in accordance with applicable laws and acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy, we may aggregate such information with the information we collect from you ourselves to help us form a more complete user profile for you.
==========
Our Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies
LogMeIn uses cookies to help us track and analyze user traffic patterns.
A "Cookie" is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
A cookie file can contain information such as a unique user ID that a website uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you elect to supply yourself.
A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.
==========
Cookies can help save you time, for example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie recalls your specific information for future visits.
In addition to cookies, our Website(s) use a variety of other methods and tools for tracking purposes, including Internet tags and web beacons, which are small pieces of data that are embedded in images and pages of our Websites.
While most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers allow you to modify your browser setting to decline cookies and/or "opt-out" of tracking technologies.
Please note however, if a visitor turns off cookies such visitor may find some of the functionality of our website and/or our services and Apps, to be reduced or impired.
==========
We also utilize both proprietary and third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to gather information designed to help us gain insight into how visitors interact with and use our Websites and Services.
You can prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics on our Websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, which is available here.
We may also use certain Google Analytics Advertising features which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to our Websites or other websites.
You can manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads through Google's Ad Settings here.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
Unless you opt-in, LogMeIn will not transfer your personal information to third parties, except we may transfer your personal information without your consent to the extent required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) conform to the edicts of law or comply with legal process served on LogMeIn or the site; (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of LogMeIn; (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety, property, or privacy of LogMeIn's employees, users of LogMeIn's products or service, or members of the public; or (iv) effect a transaction, restructuring or proceeding that transfers to a third party the assets or line of business to which the information pertains.
If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may transfer that information within LogMeIn or to LogMeIn's third party service providers with your permission.
In addition, LogMeIn may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of LogMeIn to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications).
In addition, we may share non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (for example, the proportion of male and female users) with advertisers, business partners, and other third parties in an effort to customize or enhance the content and advertising on our Website for our users.
==========
Choice/Opt-Out
Unless you take affirmative action to "opt-out" of receiving marketing and promotional materials at the point of data collection, we assume that you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy.
The "opt-out" checkbox is the means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personal information for the purpose(s) covered by the applicable opt-out choice.
You may indicate your desire to "opt-out": (i) at the point of data collection when your personal information is entered by using the "opt-out" checkbox, (ii) when you receive marketing and promotional communications from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" hyperlink and following the instructions, or (iii) at any time by sending an email request to support@logmein.com (please indicate "Opt-Out" in the subject line) or by sending a written request to our address as provided below ("Contact Us").
In certain cases, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt-in".
This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.
