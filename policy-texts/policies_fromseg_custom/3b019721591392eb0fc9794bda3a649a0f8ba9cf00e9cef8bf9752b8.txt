Clear Gifs

==========
INFORMATION SHARING
Except as described in this policy, OneLogin will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party other than as outlined in this policy.

We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
OneLogin may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
