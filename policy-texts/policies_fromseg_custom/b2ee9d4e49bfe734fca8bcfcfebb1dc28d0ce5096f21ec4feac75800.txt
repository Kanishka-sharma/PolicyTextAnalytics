In line with UK Government guidance in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic, Harrods is required to conduct a screening questionnaire for Covid-19 symptoms, prior to accepting hair, beauty or alteration appointments.
The results of this questionnaire will not be retained.
Harrods is also required to support the NHS Test and Trace service by retaining names, contact numbers, date and time of arrival and departure, for those customers who attend or make reservations with: the Hair and Beauty salon; cafes, restaurants; and alteration service.

To the extent that Harrods does not already hold this information, Harrods will ask for, record and store these details in a secure system for 21 days, after which they will be deleted.
Harrods will use this information solely to assist the NHS Test and Trace service, should they request this data.
Customer details which we already hold for other permitted purposes will continue to be used for those purposes and will not be deleted after 21 days but will be shared with the NHS if requested.
