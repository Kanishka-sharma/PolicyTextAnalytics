Privacy / Data Protection Notice

Thomson Reuters respects your privacy and seeks to protect your personal data.
The following information describes how we gather and use data.
The amount of information the Thomson Reuters holds on you and how it uses it depends on your relationship with the Thomson Reuters and on what service you use, so some of the sections below may not be relevant to you.
What Thomson Reuters uses your personal information for
Thomson Reuters collects and uses your information to administer, support, improve and obtain feedback on our services and to detect and prevent faults, breaches of our network security, the law or our contract terms.
We will also use all this information to assess what Thomson Reuters products and services may be of interest to individuals and to personalise our service and marketing.
If you are registered to use a service we may contact you to obtain feedback on that service and any improvements we could make to it.
Further information/marketing
If you have agreed to such contact, Thomson Reuters may contact you about those of its other services to which you do not subscribe but which may interest you.
We may for example invite you to join a free trial of a service.
Sometimes we may invite you to client entertainment and similar events.
==========
Such contact may be by post, fax, email, instant message and (in certain limited circumstances) by telephone from time to time.
You have a right to ask us at any time not to contact you by way of direct marketing.
Calls to Help Desks

Calls to Thomson Reuters telephone help desks may be recorded for quality control, regulatory and monitoring purposes.
Personal Information Thomson Reuters collects
Thomson Reuters collects and updates information about users of its services, suppliers, account and IT managers and other individuals it deals with in its day-to-day business.
It may obtain this information via direct contact with you, from third parties such as your employer or another one of our suppliers and automatically via your use of our services.
Information you/others give us:
This information includes your contact details, registration and payment details, support problems, details around participation in events, prize draws or surveys and certain relevant details of your interests and preferences.
Information may also be obtained on you as a result of authentication or identity checks, including as required by anti money laundering laws.
==========
Information we collect via our services:
If you are a registered user of our services Thomson Reuters also gathers information about your use of our services, such as generic types of data accessed, times and volume of use of the services and Traffic Data.
Traffic Data includes logs, details of networks, data and systems accessed, details of the sender and recipients of messages sent over our services, times and location of log on or access, duration of sessions, clickstream and similar usage or system data.
Traffic Data may sometimes be traceable to/related to not just companies but named individuals.
==========
Before you register with Thomson Reuters, however, you can browse our web sites anonymously.
Storage methods and duration
Thomson Reuters may store your information in its databases, such as its Customer Relationship database, for reference.
The information may be retained and used by Thomson Reuters for a reasonable period, reflecting our need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services and any data retention requirements of the law.
This means we may retain information after an individual ceases to use Thomson Reuters services or after the individual has ceased interacting with us.
Except where the law, authorities or regulatory bodies require us to retain it for longer, we retain Traffic Data for a reasonable period after the Traffic Data was generated, including in some circumstances (such as with firewall logs or fault data) after any bill has been paid.
The details of money laundering checks, user authentication or verification checks and details of trading or other regulated activity may be retained for so long as the law or the regulator requires or evidence of the trade is required.
==========
Passing your information to others in your own organisation
If your employer subscribed for the service on your behalf then we may pass certain information to your employer about your use of the service where your employer has a legitimate reason to receive it.
Similarly if you are the point contact person in your organisation for a service, we may pass your contact details to those in your organisation for this purpose.
Passing your information to third parties

Except where the law permits or unless you specifically agree, Thomson Reuters does not sell or rent your personal data to others outside Thomson Reuters.
In some instances, we may pass information to third parties involved in the relevant service (such as to stock exchanges or third party information and software providers) who wish to manage and check the distribution of their information/software and obtain payment for it.
==========
They may then match it with the data they have for this purpose.
You will generally know if such a transfer of your personal data happens, except if the third parties are simply working on our behalf as our subcontractors, administrators (such as companies that process credit card payments) or our professional advisers or if the data is required to be disclosed by law or to a regulator then we might not inform you.
If we sell a business division to another company and your personal data is used by that business then your data may be transferred to the buyer along with the business for them to use in the same way.
==========
Cookies/Software agents
A "cookie" is a piece of software, which may be sent to your computer.
Cookies enable us to collect information about how our web sites and services are being used and to manage them more efficiently.
Until you have registered on our web sites, the cookie will only track general usage patterns and technical information about your computer type and will not be used to identify you individually.
After registration, cookies will be used to collect information on you as described in "Personal Information Thomson Reuters collects".
You can turn off the ability to receive cookies by adjusting the browser in your computer but you should note that if you do so, this may materially distort the quality of service and data you receive.
==========
You therefore do this at your own risk.
Thomson Reuters also uses agents with your computer to assist with our diagnosis of technical problems and therefore to obtain information about software versions installed and data transmitted, for software compliance purposes and for you/your company to receive software updates, new releases or additional software.
Sometimes you can refuse or remove these agents but that means you will not receive this additional software and may suffer service problems and you may lose all rights to support.
We therefore do not recommend that you remove or tamper with these agents.
==========
Newsletters
With some services you are given the opportunity to receive a related newsletter by email or post.
You can at any time choose to stop receiving a service's newsletter by following the instructions with the newsletter.
Advertising on our web sites
Where advertising is served on to our web sites there may be cookies used to collect technical information and generic usage information but third party advertisers will not be able to relate this to you as an individual without your consent.
Restricted Data Sets
If you contract for a service in your own name (and not that of your company) and that service involves the supply of trade, pricing or other financial data, your name may be included in the directory of subscribers in order that the data providers can select or restrict who can view their data.
Credit checks 

Thomson Reuters may in some instances for some fee-paying products carry out credit checks with credit reference agencies, or we may follow up references.
This will affect you if you are contracting for the service in your own name.
Then the fact that Thomson Reuters has carried out such a credit check, and in some instances the nature or results of the credit check, will appear on the agency's register against your name.
In many countries you can obtain a copy of your register entry by writing to the relevant credit reference agency, sometimes on payment of a fee.
==========
Digital Signatures/Certificates
If the product you are using has digital certificates/certificate signatures then your name and related details may be displayed as part of any certificate issued to you.
It will be seen by those to whom your certificate or signature is presented or who rely on it.
Your details may also need to be entered into a related status directory of certificates issued.
==========
Interception of mail
Thomson Reuters may intercept some mail and email addressed to individuals in Thomson Reuters.
The reasons it may do this are related to security of Thomson Reuters, its staff and others, for detection and prevention of crime and to identify correct recipients or to make sure mail is dealt with during staff absence.
In the case of emails, we may reject, delay or remove content from emails which have a nature, content or attachments which may disrupt our systems or because they may pose security issues such as viruses.
We may also filter out emails which contain certain content on the basis that content is offensive or the email is unwanted or spam.
In certain circumstances this may unfortunately result in "innocent" emails being affected but we do try and reduce such occurrences.
==========
International Transfer of your information
Because Thomson Reuters and its services are international, personal data may be made available internationally, including in countries which do not have data protection laws, or laws which provide as much protection as in the country of origin.
We seek to require those to whom we transfer your data to protect it and your privacy.
This way Thomson Reuters works to protect personal data transferred to countries which do not have data protection laws or whose laws are less strict.
News reporting
In its capacity as a news agency, Thomson Reuters gathers and stores what could be classified as personal data.
This is used for news reporting, opinion polls and related research.
==========
This privacy notice does not focus on that type of use.
Security and staff awareness
Thomson Reuters has developed strict corporate policies governing information technology.
These cover areas such as access control, authentication, audit, monitoring, alarms, data storage and back up and transmission standards and environment integrity.
==========
Thomson Reuters staff are subject to a code of conduct which requires them to adhere to privacy principles and Thomson Reuters has a privacy compliance programme.
Thomson Reuters

Thomson Reuters means Thomson Reuters and its subsidiaries or other corporate entities as they exist from time to time in which Thomson Reuters has the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such other entity (whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise).
This includes some companies which do not have the word "Reuters or Thomson" in their corporate name and which use other brands.
==========
In some circumstances these companies may have their own privacy policies for data they collect themselves, in which case users will be presented with such policies/notices on registration for those companies services.
Your local Thomson Reuters office is primarily responsible for managing the registration data, except in relation to Reuters Messaging or some Reuters Online Subscription services where Reuters On-line SA is responsible.
Where the local Thomson Reuters company is outside the EU, its representative in the European Union is Reuters Limited.
Reuters Limited is primarily responsible for managing usage and traffic data.
==========
Reuters Messaging and similar services and forums
Reuters Messaging is a real-time communication tool designed to give you access to your key market and industry sector contacts anywhere in the world.
You can save time and work more efficiently by choosing to share your presence information (for example whether you are online or away from your desk) with selected other users of Reuters Messaging.
If you have registered for Reuters Messaging or Reuters.Net mail, you will be provided with an entry in a searchable directory that allows other users of that service to view your name, email address, Messaging address, job function and place of work.
If you choose to be ex-directory then others, including your market counterparties, will not be able to search for you in the directory.
It is possible that those in or outside the Thomson Reuters service will obtain or contact you via your Messaging address even if you are ex directory, if you have for example given them your Messaging address (e.g. on your business card) or they have guessed it.
Given this and the purpose of the service you agree to the receipt of messages and to contact which you have not expressly requested.
Users agree to comply with the rules and the Code of Conduct in order to maintain the quality of the user experience.
==========
Thomson Reuters will take complaints about other users conduct and privacy seriously and you can raise such complaints at any time via the Contact Us button.
Material you post on interactive forums or chatrooms in our services will be posted alongside your user name and will be viewable by other users of the service in which the chatroom is contained.
In some limited circumstances we use extracts from chatrooms to encourage others to join the service.
Questions
More details about the way we use data in a particular service may be found in a notice or statement which is provided to you as part of that service.
