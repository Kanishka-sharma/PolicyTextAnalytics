About Nielsen
HOW WE USE OUR TECHNOLOGIES TO COLLECT INFORMATION
Nielsen works with various companies including data providers, advertisers, and publishers to measure the effectiveness and reach of content viewed on the Internet no matter what kind of device people use.
==========
For example, advertisers are able to better understand campaign performances across TV, computer and mobile audiences.
Here’s how it works: Participating companies include proprietary Nielsen measurement software in their content on their chosen sites, ads, apps, and video players.
When we use the word “content,” we mean audio, video, ad campaigns and any other media users might encounter or engage with.
The Nielsen proprietary measurement software embedded in the content uses tags (including cookies, pixel tags, and our software contained in mobile applications) or watermarks to gather information to help understand what content users are exposed to and interact with, what advertising campaigns are effective, and the aggregated demographic composition of a website’s or application’s visitors or viewers of digital content.
A sample report might be “this ad campaign was viewed by 5 million females between the ages 24-30.”
==========
We also work with third party service providers to obtain non-personally identifiable data and add that data to our measurements.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
==========
We do not identify—and will not attempt to identify—the users who were exposed to content.
Nielsen’s proprietary digital measurement software may collect information about the content that was viewed (e.g., which ad campaign, which program episode, etc.), where the content was viewed (e.g., on which website or in which app, etc.), and general information about the device on which the content was viewed (e.g., tablet or smartphone, device identifier, IP address, operating system, etc.).
Our Nielsen Online Brand Effect and Mobile Brand Effect services randomly present short surveys to users who may or may not have been exposed to our clients’ content.
==========
Responses are voluntary.
If the viewer responds to a survey question, the response is stored in a database.
The surveys do not ask for or collect any identifiable data.
HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?
==========
We use this information to create a variety of insights, reports, and analyses, including the composition of the audience that viewed certain content, or about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
Nielsen may also calibrate the information collected with other online and offline data sources and research tools, including non-identifying Nielsen panelist viewing.
The other data sources may include social media or ecommerce sites.
These additional sources allow us to perform more robust research and analyses concerning Internet audience demographics, preferences, and use.
Only non-identifiable or aggregated data are included in our insights, reports, and analyses.
==========
WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?
We employ or work with other companies or individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.
Such companies or individuals may be provided with access to the information needed to perform their functions, but are prohibited from using such information for any other purpose.
==========
In addition, we may release information to third parties when disclosure is required by law or when necessary or desirable to exercise or preserve our legal rights, or to take action regarding potentially illegal activities.
If all or part of our company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, your information, whether personally identifying or otherwise, may be transferred as part of that transaction, and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information is protected as described in this notice.
DATA RETENTION & SECURITY
Nielsen uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect the security and confidentiality of information while controlled by us.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
==========
We store the information for as long as needed for our research and analyses purposes as described in this policy and in accordance with law.
We may store these data in the United States or we may transfer them to another country.
Wherever we hold the data, we will apply the terms of this policy and any applicable law.

CHOICES
Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to contribute to our research and insights.
If you are not currently a Nielsen panelist and do not wish to participate in Nielsen’s digital measurement research, please click here to opt out on browsers.
Please note that because this is a browser-level opt-out, if you use more than one browser, you will need to opt out in each.
If you delete your cookies, you will have to opt-out again.
In the mobile app environment, we require each application that contains active Nielsen’s measurement software to disclose in the app store’s description its presence, and provide access to an opt-out.
Please note that because this is an app-level and device-specific opt-out, if you have more than one mobile app that contains our software, or if you have the same app on more than one mobile device, you will need to opt out in each.
