Oracle’s handling of this information is subject to the terms of the General Oracle Privacy Policy.
I. SERVICES PERSONAL INFORMATION DATA PROCESSING TERMS
Oracle treats all Services Personal Information in accordance with the terms of Sections I and III of this Policy and Your order for Services.
In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Services Privacy Policy and any privacy terms incorporated into Your order for Services, including an Oracle Data Processing Agreement, the relevant privacy terms of Your order for Services shall take precedence.
1.
Performance of the Services
Oracle may process Services Personal Information for the processing activities necessary to perform the Services, including for testing and applying new product or system versions, patches, updates and upgrades, and resolving bugs and other issues You have reported to Oracle.
2.
==========
Customer instructions
You are the controller of the Services Personal Information processed by Oracle to perform the Services.
Oracle will process your Services Personal Information as specified in Your Services order and Your documented additional written instructions to the extent necessary for Oracle to (i) comply with its processor obligations under applicable data protection law or (ii) assist You to comply with Your controller obligations under applicable data protection law relevant to Your use of the Services.
Oracle will promptly inform You if, in our reasonable opinion, Your instruction infringes applicable data protection law.
Additional fees may apply.
3.
==========
Rights of individuals
You control access to Your Services Personal Information by Your end users, and Your end users should direct any requests related to their Services Personal Information to You.
To the extent such access is not available to You, Oracle will provide reasonable assistance with requests from individuals to access, delete or erase, restrict, rectify, receive and transmit, block access to or object to processing of Services Personal Information on Oracle systems.
4.
==========
Security and confidentiality
Oracle has implemented and will maintain technical and organizational measures designed to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Services Personal Information.
These measures, which are generally aligned with the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard, govern all areas of security applicable to the Services, including physical access, system access, data access, transmission, input, security oversight, and enforcement.
Oracle employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of personal information.
Employees' obligations include written confidentiality agreements, regular training on information protection, and compliance with company policies concerning protection of confidential information.
See additional details regarding the specific security measures that apply to the Services are set out in the security practices for these Services, including regarding data retention and deletion, available for review.
5.
==========
Incident Management and data breach notification.
Oracle promptly evaluates and responds to incidents that create suspicion of or indicate unauthorized access to or handling of Services Personal Information.
If Oracle becomes aware and determines that an incident involving Services Personal Information qualifies as a breach of security leading to the misappropriation or accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Services Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed on Oracle systems that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of such Services Personal Information, Oracle will report such breach to You without undue delay.
As information regarding the breach is collected or otherwise reasonably becomes available to Oracle and to the extent permitted by law, Oracle will provide You with additional relevant information concerning the breach reasonably known or available to Oracle.
6.
==========
Subprocessors
To the extent Oracle engages third party subprocessors to have access to Services Personal Information in order to assist in the provision of Services, such subprocessors shall be subject to the same level of data protection and security as Oracle under the terms of Your order for Services.
Oracle is responsible for its subprocessors’ compliance with the terms of Your order for Services.
Oracle maintains lists of Oracle Affiliates and subprocessors that may process Services Personal Information.
Additional information is available to You via My Oracle Support (https://support.oracle.com) Document ID 2121811.1, or other applicable primary support tool provided for the Services.
7.
==========
Cross-border data transfers
Oracle may transfer, access and store Services Personal Data globally as necessary to perform the Services.
To the extent such global access involves a transfer of Services Personal Information originating from the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom  (“EEA”) and/or Switzerland to Oracle affiliates or third party subprocessors located in countries outside the EEA or Switzerland that have not received a binding adequacy decision by the European Commission or by a competent national EEA data protection authority, such transfers are subject to binding and appropriate transfer mechanisms that provide an adequate level of protection in compliance with applicable data protection law, such as EU Model Clauses.
Oracle also complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Services Personal Information when You and Oracle have agreed by contract that transfers of such information from the EEA or Switzerland will be transferred and processed pursuant to the Privacy Shield for the relevant Services.
Oracle will then be responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as an agent on our behalf do the same.
Oracle has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Services Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

8.
==========
Audit rights
To the extent provided in your order for Services, You may at Your sole expense audit Oracle’s compliance with the terms of this Services Privacy Policy by sending Oracle a written request, including a detailed audit plan, at least six weeks in advance of the proposed audit date.
You and Oracle will work cooperatively to agree on a final audit plan.
The audit shall be conducted no more than once during a twelve-month period, during regular business hours, subject to Oracle’s on-site policies and regulations, and may not unreasonably interfere with business activities.
If You would like to use a third party to conduct the audit, the third party auditor shall be mutually agreed to by the parties and the third-party auditor must execute a written confidentiality agreement acceptable to Oracle.
Upon completion of the audit, You will provide Oracle with a copy of the audit report, which is classified as confidential information under the terms of Your agreement with Oracle.
Oracle will contribute to such audits by providing You with the information and assistance reasonably necessary to conduct the audit, including any relevant records of processing activities applicable to the Services.
If the requested audit scope is addressed in a SOC 1 or SOC 2, ISO, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA or similar audit report issued by a qualified third party auditor within the prior twelve months and Oracle provides such report to You confirming there are no known material changes in the controls audited, You agree to accept the findings presented in the third party audit report in lieu of requesting an audit of the same controls covered by the report.
Additional audit terms may be included in Your order for Services.
9.
==========
Deletion or return of Services Personal Information
Except as otherwise specified in an order for services or required by law, upon termination of services or at your request, Oracle will delete your production customer data located on Oracle computers in a manner designed to ensure that they cannot reasonably be accessed or read, unless there is a legal obligation imposed on Oracle preventing it from deleting all or part of the data.
You may consult with your Oracle services contact for additional information on data deletion prior to service completion.
