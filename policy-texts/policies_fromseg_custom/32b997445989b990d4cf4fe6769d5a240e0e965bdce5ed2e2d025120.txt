At guardian.co.uk we collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons:
1.
To help us to monitor and improve the services we offer.
2.
To provide personalised services unique to individual users.
3.
==========
To use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the site.
This might mean showing an advertiser how many users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser.
Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual's information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user's explicit permission.
==========
Our principles
We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy.
Our policy can be summarised in one sentence: we will not share your information with others without your prior consent.

3.
We will not pass on any individual user details (including your email address) for third party use unless we have your prior consent.

==========
We always ensure that contractors we use in connection with the running of the website and services (for example hosting providers) are subject to strict contractual obligations.
They are only able to process data on our behalf and in accordance with our principles and instructions and not for any other independent purpose.

6.
==========
Our site is accessible via the Internet and so may potentially be accessed by anyone around the world.
Other users may access the site from outside the European Economic Area.
This means that, where you choose to post your data on the site, this could be accessed from anywhere around the world and therefore a transfer of your data outside of the European Economic Area may be deemed to have occurred.
You consent to such transfer of your data for and by way of this purpose.
Where we or our contractors transfer data outside of the European Economic Area this is only ever done with the relevant protections required by law in place.
