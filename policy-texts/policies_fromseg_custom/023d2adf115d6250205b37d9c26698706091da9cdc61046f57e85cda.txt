Privacy Information
Digitize New Media Limited (“Digitize”) provides online media buying services via it’s performance network to it’s advertiser and agency clients.
In doing so we utilise a technology to help ensure that our client’s adverts are shown to the most relevant users on the most relevant websites.
Generally, an internet user’s ID (which is hashed when we receive it) comes into contact with Digitizes technology when a user views an ad, connecting to our technology platform.
As a general rule of thumb advertisers pay more for relevant and targeted advertising which supports online publishers in continuing to provide us with the free online content that we all love.
==========
Personally Identifiable Information: We don’t process or use Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via our Technology.
For sake of clarity, Digitize does not have access or process or use your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Social/National Insurance Number, credit card information, or anything else that can personally identify you.
==========
Our demand side platforms collect the IP address and some of them send this data to us but once we receive this data we delete it before we save it into our database in truncated form.
However, normally our demand side platforms send us IP addresses in truncated form.
Sensitive Personal Data We don’t process any data relating to or infer your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, your health, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or sexual orientation.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via our Technology which may include but not limited to:
Date and Time
User ID (which is hashed)
IP  address (truncated)
Geo & Country
Operating System
Browser
Language

Device Type
Because IP addresses are stored in truncated form only and User IDs are stored in hashed form this information is not considered as PII but instead as Pseudonymous Data.
==========
Cookies and Web Beacons Our technology uses cookies in conjunction with Web beacons in order to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you.
We also use cookies and web beacons to understand your browsing and buying activities so that we can measure the success of our own and our clients online advertising campaigns
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website.
Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user returns to a website or goes to another website.
Cookies are often used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics.
This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, make the website easier to use, measure the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailor their website to better match a user’s interests and preferences.
==========
Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a user’s hard drive, or to personally identify them.
Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive.
==========
How is our information secured and protected?
All of the user data collected by Digitize is stored only in limited and aggregated form meaning that information about a specific user cannot be retrieved.
Even so we maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorised or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction.
==========
The data is kept on a secure server and we restrict access to the data solely to authorised users.
Data in the database is protected by hard passwords only known to authorised technical users for operational reasons and is encrypted and compressed using the database vendor’s proprietary compression algorithms; decompression is only available to logged in authorised users and applications.
All data is stored at our offices and furthermore no data is stored by us on servers outside of the European Union.
==========
No security measures, however thorough, are perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess.
Processing of Data Where data is processed by us it is only done so if prior consent has been received by a Publisher of a website or App or where a Client of our advertising buying services provides us with instructions which involve prior consent by a user.
From time to time we may also process data under the lawful grounds of Legitimate Use as permitted under the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).
==========
An example of such Legitimate Use would be fraud detection.
In each instance where it is proposed to process data either on a single use or continuous use basis the proposal will be subjected to a balance of use test where we will evaluate the privacy interests of the user against the Legitimate Use of the data by Digitize New Media and a written copy of this test will be maintained should the processing go ahead.
==========
Information Sharing The security of information is important to us.
We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it.
This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Non-PII information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us at privacy@digitize.ie
As described above, Digitize stores only in limited data form (Pseudonymous, non- PII) on its servers.
We may disclose this Pseudonymous Non-PII information to third parties when we reasonably believe that we are obligated to do so by law when covered by Legitimate Interest as permitted in the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person after we have conducted a balance of rights test under legal guidance.
