Introduction
Ve Global UK Limited (“Ve” or “we”) is a technology company headquartered in the UK that provides advertising and marketing solutions (“Services”) to a variety of clients who have online operations (“Clients”).
We contract directly with most of our Clients to provide our Services.
We also make available our Services to certain affiliate partner networks who are able to on-provide our Services to their respective clients.
In this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), the term “Clients” also includes these clients of our affiliate partners.
==========
We take privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring a safe online experience.
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you to make informed choices when using Client Sites and/or Our Site.
This Privacy Policy applies only to the use of your personal information when obtained by Ve.
It doesn’t apply to personal information collected during your communications with Clients and/or third parties, unless that personal information is shared with Ve in any of the circumstances described in this Privacy Policy.
==========
When we receive or export data from or to organisations outside the UK or the EU, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, or other permitted measures to allow the data to flow freely in accordance with the GDPR.
Where VE GlobalUK transfers data to recipients inside the EEA, no further measure is necessary currently, although we will keep this under review.
==========
We collect personal information about:
• End users who visit Client websites: when you visit or interact with our Clients’ websites, mobile applications and services (including those of our affiliate networks) (“Client Sites”), we collect and process personal information about you.
We use this information to understand more about you and to advertise or promote our Clients’ products and services to you.
• Clients and other visitors to our own website: we collect and process personal information about Client personnel who use our Services and others who visit Ve’s website (“Our Site”).

Part I - Information for end users who visit Client Sites
1.
==========
What personal information do we collect and how do we collect it?
We collect the following categories of personal information from you:
email addresses and/or telephone numbers, if voluntarily entered into a Client Site by you (e.g. to buy a product or service, become a registered user, or sign up for marketing communications) (“Contact Details”);
data relating to your browsing activity through the use of cookies, web beacons and pixel tags and similar technologies deployed on Client Sites or via emails sent by Ve on behalf of Clients (“Behavioural Data”), including:
IP (internet protocol) address; referring site URL (website address) where your session started, and details about your device, including type (e.g. mobile or tablet), brand, model, operating system name and version, browser name, version, language and protocol, and other unique numbers assigned to a device (e.g. IDFA on iPhone, Google adID on Android);
details about the pages of Client Sites visited and activities on Client Sites (e.g. products viewed or purchased, including details of purchases made and the time and duration of visits to pages of the Client’s Site), page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page;
using your IP address, your geolocation (e.g. postcode); and
events relating to ads served on you, such as the number of ads displayed to you and whether you clicked on an ad; and
email; name; and phone  number; and gender, in each case if input into a Client Site by you (“Profile Data”).
For more information about the technology that we use to collect Behavioural Data, please see our Cookie Policy.
We also receive Behavioural Data and Profile Data from, and may share it with, third party partners (through “cookie synching” or similar matching technologies).
==========
To serve you our personalised advertisements on Clients websites and provide you with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on the different browsers and environments you are using (“ID Syncing”).
Thanks to its ID-syncing technology, Ve is able to serve you the most relevant ads on whichever device or browser you are currently using.
For this purpose, Ve uses exact linking methods by leveraging the technical data collected through out technology such as our advertising partners’ identifiers or email hash that they may pass to us.
We may also receive ID-syncing information from trusted partners using diverse linking methods for the same purpose and with the same level of guarantees in terms of Privacy and Data Protection.
==========
We do not collect sensitive information from you (such as data relating to health or religious beliefs).
Although it may be possible for us to infer certain information, such as your religious beliefs, from certain Behavioural Data that we may collect, we do not create or use segments that rely on the use of sensitive personal information for the purposes of online behavioural advertising.
2.
==========
How do we use the information we collect?
We collect personal information from you to a) help our Clients to market, and facilitate the sale of, their products and services more effectively and/or efficiently and b) provide a more personalised online experience for you.
We achieve this by using information that we have collected (including Behavioural Data) to create inferences about your personal preferences, interests and behaviour.
==========
Ve combines information that it collects from you across all Client Sites and uses that personal information for the benefit of each of its Clients.
By way of example:
if Ve collects personal information when you visit Client Site A, that personal information may be used to display an ad to you, on a third party website, for products available on Client Site B.
if Ve collects personal information when you visit Client Site A, and you subsequently visit Client Site B and provide Client B with permission to send you marketing, Ve may use the information collected on Client Site A to personalise the content of Client B’s marketing communications that are then sent to you.
We share personal information about you (including Behavioural Data and Profile Data) within the Ve group of companies to enable us to provide and improve our Services.
==========
We may share personal information with third parties for specific purposes, as further explained on the next topic.
If we wish to use your personal information for any new purpose that is not listed below, we will, prior to using such personal information, evaluate whether it is in our legitimate interest to use it for that purpose.
If we determine that it is in Ve’s legitimate interest to do so, we will update this Privacy Policy to explain the new purpose.
Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy.

You may also need to contact Clients if you wish to opt-out of other communications made by them or on their behalf.
==========
