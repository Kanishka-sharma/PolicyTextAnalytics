==========
ServiceNow uses cookies for several reasons.
Some cookies are strictly necessary to enable core site functionality.
We refer to these as “required” cookies.
For example, we may use required cookies to authenticate your access to various areas of our Website.
Other cookies allow us to enhance your browsing experience, tailor content to your preferences, and make your interactions with our Website more meaningful.
We refer to these as “functional” cookies.
For example, we may use functional cookies to determine whether you have visited our Website before and inform us about site features in which you have interest, thereby permitting us to better tailor our Website content.
Functional cookies also allow us to analyze Website traffic so we can measure and improve performance and speed up your searches.

==========
Do Not Track
While ServiceNow attempts to honor do not track (“DNT”) instructions we receive from your browser, we cannot guarantee that ServiceNow will always respond to such signals, in part because of the lack of common industry standard for DNT technology.
We continue to monitor developments in DNT technology and stay apprised of DNT industry standards as they evolve.
