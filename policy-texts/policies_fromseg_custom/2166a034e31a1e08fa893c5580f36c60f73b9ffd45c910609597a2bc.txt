Yardi Systems, Inc. and its affiliated entities (“Yardi”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and achieving and maintaining the trust of our clients (“Yardi Clients” or “Clients”), users of and visitors to the Yardi websites listed below (collectively, “Visitors”), and other users of smart hardware or devices hosted by Yardi as described below.
Central to this mission is providing a robust security and privacy program that carefully considers data protection matters across the suite of products and services offered by Yardi (“Yardi Services” or “Services”), including data stored by Yardi on behalf of its Clients and their customers in connection with our Services (“Client Data”), and with respect to “personal data,” as defined by the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and “personal information,” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) (collectively, “personal information”).
Web Sites Covered
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding information we collect from individuals (“you” or “your”) who visit Yardi’s Internet Listing Service (ILS) websites and associated Yardi microsites (including, but not limited to COMMERCIALCafé, CommercialEdge, RENTCafé, and STORAGECafé) and any other Yardi-controlled websites that link to this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “Yardi Sites”).
When we collect personal information on the Yardi Sites, certain additional disclosures that are specific to the context of our collection and use of the information being collected (e.g. a registration page), may be provided to you.
For the avoidance of any doubt, we will adhere to those commitments and any such additional privacy policy statements are hereby incorporated into this Privacy Statement.
==========
Hardware Covered
Yardi may license Yardi’s Home IQ services to allow Clients to use smart locks, smart thermostat hardware devices, and/or other compatible wirelessly connected smart devices (as may be applicable) (collectively, the “Home IQ Device(s)”), together with a Yardi gateway hub (the “Home IQ Hub”) installed in each applicable unit, and any related Yardi-hosted software functionality to provide smart home functionality in each applicable unit.
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding information we collect from individuals that use such Home IQ Devices or the Home IQ Hub.
==========
IMPORTANT: THIS PRIVACY NOTICE DOES NOT APPLY TO CLIENT DATA.
Yardi’s confidentiality/privacy and other obligations with respect to its Services, and Client Data (which is data collected and controlled by Yardi Clients as part of Yardi’s cloud services), are governed solely by the agreements under which the Services are provided to our Clients.
The traditional licensees of Yardi Services are residential and commercial real estate property owners and property managers (again, collectively, as used in this Privacy Notice, “Yardi Clients” or “Clients”).
Yardi generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom our Clients’ Client Data may pertain; Yardi merely hosts or processes such data on behalf of our Clients.
If you have any questions about the data practices of a Yardi Client that uses Yardi Services to process your personal information, please contact the Yardi Client directly.
==========
To reach out to your property manager, simply look up your apartment community on RENTCafé – first choose your city and you’ll then have the option to perform a search by property name.
Once you’ve found your apartment community, you will see helpful information listed (phone no.
included) that you can use to contact your property manager.
==========
Web Sites Not Covered
This Privacy Statement does not apply to personal information collected by Yardi Clients using Yardi Services.
For example, some Yardi Services enable Yardi Clients to create websites and applications of their own that run on the Yardi platform.
The terms of service and privacy notice of the Yardi Client govern such websites and applications.
If you submitted personal information to a Yardi Client-controlled website or application (e.g. property branded RENTCafé resident portals) and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly.
The Yardi Sites may contain links to other third-party websites.
==========
The information practices or content of such other websites is governed by the privacy statements or notices of such other websites.
Yardi encourages you to review the privacy statements or notices of such other websites to understand their information practices.
==========
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
Some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), impose certain responsibilities on data controllers and data processors.
A company is a data controller when it has the responsibility of determining why and how personal information is processed, whereas a company is a data processor when it processes personal information on behalf of a data controller.
Yardi is a data processor and not a data controller under GDPR with respect to Client Data.
Yardi Clients are data controllers because they make all decisions about how or why Client Data, containing personal information or not, is to be processed, including any disclosure or transmission to third parties.
If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted or entered into a Yardi Service by or on behalf of a Yardi Client, or was otherwise collected by a Yardi Service on behalf of a Yardi Client, and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly.
If an authorized Yardi Client requests that we update or remove the data in question and the Client has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will acknowledge their request within 30 days.
==========
California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)
If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights with respect to personal information, as set forth in Cal.
Civ.
Code 1798.100 et seq.
==========
This “Rights of Individuals” section of this Privacy Statement addresses those California-specific rights as applied to the CCPA-covered information, including the right to request information about the personal information we collect and share and to request access to and deletion of such information consistent with the provisions of the law.
Please note that most of the personal information Yardi collects and maintains Yardi maintains on behalf of Yardi clients, as a service provider to those Yardi clients.
As a result, Yardi clients’ privacy policies, not this Privacy Statement, cover that information.
As a result, if you make a request to us with respect to such data, we will refer you to the Yardi client (for instance, property management companies) on whose behalf we may maintain the information to assist you with your request.
Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”)
To the extent it is applicable, this Privacy Statement is made under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.

Rights of Individuals
Rectifying Personal Information Submitted on Yardi Sites
If we have collected and processed your personal information based on your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the Privacy Feedback form.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
Visitors who wish to correct, update, change, or erase the personal information they submit on certain Yardi Sites should be able to go back to the applicable registration page or web form to edit their user or organization record.
However, some of the information voluntarily submitted that is not personal information, such as a response to a poll or a survey, is typically aggregated and thus not correctable, updatable, changeable, or erasable.
For additional information or problems accessing your information from such page, call us at +1 (805) 699-2040, or contact us using our Privacy Feedback form.
If you consider that we have processed your personal information in violation of applicable law and failed to remedy such violation to your reasonable satisfaction, you may also lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in your country.
