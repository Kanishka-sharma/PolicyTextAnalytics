==========
By visiting any domain or subdomain of smallpdf.com, your IP address and other usage metrics will be logged along with the dates and times of access.
Other personal data that we obtain from you includes:
1.1 Account
If you create any paying Smallpdf account via our website, we store data about your account in a service called Auth0.
This includes your email, name, and address if you have added them in your profile.
==========
We also save the plan you are on and whether you have paid with PayPal, a credit card or other payment methods, your VAT number, type of credit card or payment method information, last 4 digits of credit card, IP, user settings, company, role, industry & employees size.
For security reasons we also save the time, browser and IP of your last login and the time of your last password reset.
1.2 Payment
Our payment providers are Braintree and Stripe.
Your PayPal account or credit card information is stored here so that we can charge you in the upcoming billing cycle, depending on your current subscription.
Any personal information you provide to Braintree, Stripe and PayPal will be processed by them in accordance with their privacy policies.
Please review their privacy policies in order to understand what types of personal information they collect from you.
Your full credit card number will never reach our server and will always be sent directly to Braintree or Stripe from your computer.
We can only see the first and last 4 digits of your credit card.
==========
We also store information about your subscription details in Braintree or Stripe, including: plan, status and price, first billing date, current billing period and paid-through date.
We store information about every PayPal or credit card transaction, including: payer email (for PayPal), payer name, transaction type, amount, time, and status.
Lastly, we also import information from Braintree and Stripe into Chartmogul to get a better overview of our subscriptions.
==========

Your invoices are stored in a database on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) in Ireland.
Here, we store detailed data relating to transactions and subscriptions from Braintree or Stripe, your account from Auth0, and VAT tax-related information.
As an additional backup, the raw data used to generate the invoice database entry is also saved as a file on AWS.

Compliance with Licenses
If you are a business, company, or organization, then we may, no more than once every 12 months, upon seven 7 days’ prior notice to you, appoint our personnel or an independent third party auditor who is obliged to maintain confidentiality to inspect (including manual inspection, electronic methods, or both) your records, systems, and facilities to verify that your installation and use of any and all Software or Services is in conformity with its valid licenses from us.
Additionally, you will provide us with all records and information requested by us in order to verify that its installation and use of any and all Software and Services is in conformity with your valid licenses from us within 30 days of our request.
If the verification discloses a shortfall in licenses for the Software or Services, you will immediately acquire any necessary licenses, subscriptions, and any applicable back maintenance and support.
If the underpaid fees exceed 5% of the value of the payable license fees, then you will also pay for our reasonable cost of conducting the verification.
