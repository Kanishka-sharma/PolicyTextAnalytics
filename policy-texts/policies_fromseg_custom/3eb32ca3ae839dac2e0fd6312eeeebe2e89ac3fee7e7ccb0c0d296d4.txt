Adobe may collect information about you in connection with social networking sites in several ways, such as:

When you sign in to an Adobe website or application using a social networking account, such as a Facebook account.
These social networking sign-in features may also enable an Adobe account to be created more easily by using the information you provided to the social networking site.
When you use an Adobe app on a social networking site or choose to join (or “like”) an Adobe page on a social networking site (such as the Adobe Photoshop page on Facebook).
In these situations, the social networking site may make some information about you available to Adobe.
Please see the privacy policy for the social networking site to learn more.
When you interact with an Adobe social networking page or content, we may use cookies to learn which links you clicked (learn more about cookies and how we use the information collected).
When you make information publicly available on your social networking page, we may collect that information.
We use this information for purposes described in our privacy policy.
