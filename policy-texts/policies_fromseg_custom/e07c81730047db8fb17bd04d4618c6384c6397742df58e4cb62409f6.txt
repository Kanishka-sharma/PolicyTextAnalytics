Automatic Information:
            We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us and the Site.

We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to You.

In our e-mails to you, we use "pixel tags" to determine if your email software or service can display html-formatted e-mail (this helps us optimize the size of our e-mail messages and conserve bandwidth).

If you click on an advertisement, for example, a cookie might be placed on your computer.
However, we have no access to or control over these companies, their privacy policies or their cookies, and their practice and policies may change from time to time so you should read their privacy policies and decide whether they are acceptable to You.
