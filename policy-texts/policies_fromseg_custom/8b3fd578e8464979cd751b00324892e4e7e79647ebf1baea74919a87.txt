BizRate.com Privacy Notice

BizRate.com is an online shopping marketplace and
merchant rating service designed to deliver the best possible online shopping
experience to you, our users.
We are committed to protecting the privacy and
security of the information we may gather about you, and we appreciate your
trust that we will use and share that information carefully and sensibly.
As part of our ongoing commitment to your privacy and security, we are
proud to be a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, a leading
industry-sponsored privacy program.
TRUSTe's certification covers
BizRate.com's gathering and dissemination of information, not any services or
products.
More information about TRUSTe is set forth below.
==========
This Privacy Notice describes our privacy policy.
Although this Privacy
Notice may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe
you should know as much as possible about BizRate.com's practices so that you
can make informed decisions.
By accepting the User Agreement, using BizRate.com
or any co-branded Web site, shopping at participating merchants, completing
our surveys, participating in our sweepstakes or other incentives, responding
to our emails, or otherwise interacting with BizRate.com, you are consenting
to the BizRate.com practices, including the use and disclosure of any personally identifiable information you have
shared with us, as described in this Privacy Notice.
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN
BizRate.com is not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although
participating merchants on our site may offer children's products for
purchase by adults.
If you are under 18, you should use BizRate.com only with
involvement of a parent or guardian.
==========
Children under 13 may not submit any
personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have
inadvertently gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will
take appropriate steps to delete it.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES BIZRATE GATHER?
The information we learn from shoppers helps us personalize and continually
improve your shopping experience at BizRate.com and our participating
merchants.
Here are the general types of information we gather.
==========
Information You Give Us 
We receive and store any information you provide to us when you complete
merchant surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentive, become a
BizRate.com member, sign up to receive our newsletter or other email
communications, communicate by email, telephone or physical mail with our
customer service, or otherwise interact with us.
Such information may include
your name, address, email address, shopping interests and preferences,
transaction history, and other personal data.
You can choose not to provide
certain information, but then you might not be able to participate in our
surveys or incentives or take advantage of certain useful BizRate.com
features.
Information Gathered Automatically 
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with
us.
==========
For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and
"clear gifs" to obtain certain types of information when your Web
browser accesses BizRate.com and our participating merchants' sites, or when
you are provided the opportunity to complete merchant surveys, participate in
a sweepstakes or other incentive, or open or respond to any BizRate.com
newsletter or other email you may have requested.
Briefly, "cookies" are small files that we transfer to your
computer's hard drive or your Web browser memory to enable our systems to
recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you,
such as recognizing you as a BizRate.com member or customizing merchant
surveys you may be asked to complete so that you don't need to provide the
same information more than once.
"Clear gifs" are tiny graphics
with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to
track the online movements of Web users or to let us know if you have opened
an email that we sent you.
Examples of the information we collect and analyze in this manner include
the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the
Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and
version, operating system, and platform; your behavior on our Web site and
related services, including the products and merchants you view or searched
for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on
our site or not); cookie number; and participating merchants you visit.
The cookies and clear gifs that we use do
not contain and are not tied to personally identifiable information about
you.
You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,
although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site
or to participate in BizRate.com incentives.
==========
Third Party Advertising 
We work with third parties, including advertising companies and website
analysis firms, who use cookies and clear gifs to collect non-personally
identifiable information when you visit our Web site and other sites or are
offered the opportunity to participate in an incentive.
This information may
be used to provide you with better shopping or savings opportunities through
advertisements on this and other Web sites that you visit, or to conduct
market research and website analysis.
The ads appearing on our site are delivered to users by a DoubleClick DART
ad server.
Information about users' visits to our site, such as number of
times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address or other personal
information), is used to serve ads to users of our site.
Users who visit a participating merchant that is a customer of
Coremetrics, a website analysis firm, and complete our survey regarding that
merchant may receive cookies intended to help analyze their use of the
merchant's site in relation to their satisfaction with the site.
==========
DOES BIZRATE SHARE THE INFORMATION IT GATHERS?
Information about BizRate.com shoppers and other users is an important part
of our business, and we take steps to maintain the privacy and security of
such information against unauthorized access.
We generally use such
information for such purposes as providing research reports to merchants,
customizing future shopping and savings opportunities for you, improving our
services, and communicating with you if you have authorized such
communication.
In an effort to serve you better and improve your online
shopping experiences, we may also share such information as described below.
Aggregated Research Data 
We produce research reports and other information and data about online
shopping for participating merchants and other customers, as well as media
and other interested parties.
Such information and data is based upon
aggregated, anonymous information about millions of online shoppers and does
not include personally identifiable information about individuals.
==========
Agents 
From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to perform various 
functions on our behalf.
Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, 
analyzing shopper data, and providing other data and services.
In such 
instances, they may have access to personal information needed to perform their 
functions, but will be prohibited from using it for other purposes.
==========
We may at 
various times also use the RedSheriff web measurement service, which employs 
"cookies" and/or software code embedded in our web pages in order to evaluate 
key web site metrics.
RedSheriff does not collect any personally idenfiable 
information about our visitors unless they voluntarily provide it, but RedSheriff 
generally gathers non-personally-identifiable demographic or statistical 
information as described in their privacy policy at 
http://www.redsheriff.com/us/content/privacy_1.html.
RedSheriff is prohibited from using any such information except as permitted under our agreement with 
them to assist us in evaluating user behavior relating to our web site(s).
==========
Special Offers 
Sometimes we send email newsletters or special offers to selected groups of
BizRate.com shoppers who have chosen to receive email on behalf of
participating merchants or other businesses.
When we do this, we do not give
that merchant or business your name or e-mail address.
If you do not want to
receive such newsletters or offers, please click here to
contact us and be removed from our mailing list.
==========
Survey Incentives 
We may share customer information with the third parties that help us
provide survey incentives, such as discounts or savings, travel programs,
magazine subscriptions, CDs or other items, and they may share such information
with us.
For instance, for users who elect to use an online coupon for a
vacation discount and provide us with their contact information for that
purpose, we will share that information with the vacation sponsor so that
they can make arrangements directly with the coupon holder.
Business Transactions 
As we continue to develop our business, we may participate in corporate
transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, and it is possible that
another company may acquire BizRate.com or its business assets in the future.
In such cases, user information may be shared with the acquirer and/or other
reputable parties involved in those transactions.
Users will be notified via
email or a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of
ownership or control of their personal information in such a transaction.
We
provide you with 30 days notice to allow you the opportunity to notify BizRate.com
if you do not wish such information to be shared by notifying us at privacy@bizrate.com.
Protection of BizRate.com and Others 
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is
appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our User Agreement and other
agreements; assist in fraud protection or investigation; or protect the
rights, property, or security of BizRate.com, our users, or others.
==========
With Your Consent 
Other than as described above, with your consent at the time you submit
information to us, we may also share your information with participating
merchants where you have shopped from time to time or their agents or
other specified parties.
For instance, if you indicate that we are
authorized to share your survey responses about a merchant with that
merchant, we may do so.
Once we share information with your consent
with a merchant or other party, the use and protection of
that information by the merchant or other party will be subject to
the privacy policies of that party.
PARTICIPATING MERCHANT POLICIES 
Online merchants, survey incentive vendors, and others who participate in
BizRate.com services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy
initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy.
However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices
of participating merchants, survey incentive vendors, and other third
parties, we cannot be responsible for their actions.
We recommend that you
always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third parties
before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with
such parties.
==========
CO-BRANDED SERVICES 
In certain areas on our site (such as the Cellular Services and Personal
Finance areas), we have joined forces with a reputable third-party source of
specialized information and other content so that you can quickly and easily
make informed decisions about such products and services.
In each of these
areas, the BizRate.com header notes that the services are "Powered
by" or "By" the third-party (such as LetsTalk.com in the
Cellular Services area and Bankrate.com in the Personal Finance area).
This
indicates that the content resides on the third party's servers and your use
of those "co-branded" services and information gathering and usage
is governed by that company's privacy policies and terms of use, which you
can access at the bottom of each page in those areas.
We recommend that you
always review their privacy policies and terms of use before you complete any
transaction with them.
BizRate.com's User Agreement (other than provisions
relating to our privacy policies) also apply as between you and BizRate.com
with respect to your use of those third-party co-branded services accessed
through our site.
==========
HOW SECURE IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME?
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by
using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you
input.
We also use a secure server hosting location, firewall protection,
controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data.
While no
system is completely foolproof, we take the security of your personal
information very seriously, and our security measures are designed to protect
that information in a responsible manner.
WHAT INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?
If you register as a BizRate.com member, BizRate.com gives you access to your
registration information for the purpose of viewing and updating that
information.
WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information,
although that might prevent us from personalizing our service for you or
prevent you from participating in a survey or sweepstakes or taking advantage
of certain useful BizRate.com features.
==========
If you have registered as a member, you can add or update your
registration information (for instance, if your name, email address or zip
code changes), or delete your membership account entirely, at any time by
visiting the Your Account area.
We will retain in our files information you have requested to delete in
some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and
enforce our User Agreement.
Furthermore, such prior information is never
completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints,
including stored "back up" systems.
==========
EMAIL POLICIES 
From time to time,
BizRate.com will send newsletters and other email to members and others who
have agreed to be contacted by BizRate.com.
You can always choose not to
receive email from BizRate.com.
Each of our email
messages contains a link at the bottom of the email for the
purpose of adjusting your email subscription preferences.
If you do not want to receive e-mail
from us, please click here to 
be removed from our mailing list.
(If you do not want to
receive notice of changes to our User Agreement and other
legal notices from us, such as updates to this Privacy Notice, those notices
will still govern your use of BizRate.com, and it is your responsibility to
review them for changes.)
==========
PRIVACY QUESTIONS?
If you have any questions or concerns about privacy at BizRate.com, please
contact us at privacy@bizrate.com,
and we will try to answer your questions or otherwise resolve the matter to
your satisfaction.
Or, if you prefer,
you may contact us in writing at BizRate.com, 12200 W Olympic Blvd Suite 300, Los Angeles CA, 90064.
==========
If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your
inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you may then contact 
TRUSTe (http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html).
TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your
concerns.

==========
REVISIONS 
Your contacts with BizRate.com and use of BizRate.com services are subject to
this Privacy Notice.
Since our business changes constantly, this Privacy
Notice will also change from time to time.
Users will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our Web site
for 30 days prior to the effective date of any material changes to this
Privacy Notice.
We provide you with 30 days notice to allow you the
opportunity to notify BizRate.com if you do not wish your information to be
subject to the proposed changes to this Privacy Notice.
You should also check
for recent changes on our Web site or other services whenever you visit.
==========
ANTI-SPAM POLICY
BizRate.com is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam").
We do 
not send emails to anyone without permission and we do not sell or provide email 
addresses to any unauthorized third party.
If you receive any unsolicited emails 
from spammers, please be assured that BizRate.com did not provide your email address 
to such parties.
BizRate.com is trusted by over 2,500 online stores to gather over 
one million surveys per month directly from their customers at the point-of-sale.
==========
We take this responsibility very seriously and would never compromise the goodwill of 
our business by intentionally sending or assisting others to send spam.
This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet.
Unfortunately, spammers 
obtain email addresses in a number of devious ways, including when you respond 
and ask to be taken off a spam email list, and in some cases by just generating emails 
to millions of random email addresses in the hopes of getting a few "live" ones.
Please 
be assured that at BizRate.com we hate spam as much as you do.
All that said, if you believe that you have gotten unsolicited email from us, please contact 
privacy@bizrate.com and we will investigate.
==========
In a few cases, we have found that consumers who have filled out an online survey 
mistakenly believe that we are contacting them without their permission (i.e., "spamming" 
them) when in fact we are confirming their sweepstakes entry or inviting them to complete 
a follow-up fulfillment survey regarding their online purchase.
Follow-up fulfillment surveys 
are important to verify that that merchant in fact delivered the product or services as 
promised and to measure satisfaction with shipping times, etc.
Please be assured that we 
strive not to contact anyone without their permission, and if you prefer not to receive any 
further communications from us, just tell us and we'll try to make sure you never hear from 
us again.
