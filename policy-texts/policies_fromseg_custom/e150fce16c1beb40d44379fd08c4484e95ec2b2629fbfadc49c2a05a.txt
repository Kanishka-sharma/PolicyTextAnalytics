YOUR RIGHTS AS A DATA SUBJECT / PRIVACY TOOL
BidTheatre's Privacy Tool is the preferred way of accessing your personal data in the BidTheatre DSP.
The tool facilitates the possibility for you to exercise a number of your user rights in terms of personal data:
The right to object to processing - You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (i.e. if you no longer want to be contacted with potential opportunities).
==========
The right to be informed - You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights.
This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Policy.
The right of access - You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re processing it), and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy).
This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
==========
The right to erasure - This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep using it.
This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.
The right to rectification - You are entitled to have your information corrected if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
==========
The right to restrict further processing - You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information.
When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further.
We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
The right to data portability - You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal information for your own purposes across different services.
For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability.
HOW CAN YOU ENSURE THAT NO PERSONAL DATA IS STORED?
==========
BidTheatre inspects three settings to determine whether user data can be stored
BidTheatre respects the Do Not Track (DNT) initiative, please consult your browser settings for details on how to enable DNT in your browser.
BidTheatre inspects your user ID for an suppression / consent setting.
To suppress personal data collection or use, or revoke consent, access the Privacy Tool here.
Upon analysing opportunities to purchase ad space to target ads to our end users, we inspect and respect Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) industry standard signals for end-user consent.
You may alter these signals by giving or revoking your consent at publishers that have implemented consent collection and adhere to IAB standards.
CONSEQUENCE OF NOT PROVIDING PERSONAL DATA
The consequence of objecting or restricting processing and/or withdrawing consent is that no we will be able to make less informed or precise automated decisions about what ads to show to you.
As a data subject, you have the right to make a complaint to the Swedish data protection authority Datainspektionen.
