Governing Law and Legal Actions.
If you signed up to use the Site or the Products prior to June 7, 2016, the following terms shall apply:
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
All legal actions in connection with the Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts.
If you signed up to use the Site or the Products on or after June 7, 2016, the following terms shall apply:
You hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
==========
The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be held at the AAA location in Boston, Massachusetts, unless you are a “consumer” as defined under the AAA rules.
Disputes with consumers, as therein defined, will be resolved by binding arbitration conducted under the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as applicable.
Consumers may request that the arbitration occur in or near the city/state stated in your account record with us.
==========
The procedures for commencing an arbitration are available here (provided however, that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court only on an individual, non-class basis).
ARBITRATION MUST BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
THIS MEANS NEITHER YOU NOR WE MAY JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS, SUBSCRIBERS OR USERS, OR LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
==========
Only a court, and not an arbitrator, shall determine the validity and effect of the class action waiver.
Even if all parties have opted to litigate a claim in court, you or we may elect arbitration with respect to any claim made by a new party or any new claims later asserted in that lawsuit.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph.
In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.
If you initiate a litigation or any other proceeding against us in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay our reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with its enforcement of this paragraph.
The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.
The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs.
1-16).
