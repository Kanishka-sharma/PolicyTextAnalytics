Cookies:
When you interact with the salesforce.com Website we strive to make that experience easy and
meaningful.
When you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer.
Cookies
are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether
customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.
Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally.
They merely recognize your browser.
Unless you choose to identify yourself to salesforce.com, either by responding to a promotional
offer, opening an account, or registering for a 30-day Test Drive, you remain anonymous to
salesforce.com.
==========
Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based.
Session cookies exist
only during an online session.
They disappear from your computer when you close your browser
software or turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed
your browser or turned off your computer.
They include such information as a unique identifier for
your browser.
Salesforce.com uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to
uniquely identify you while you are logged in.

Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you

fact that you are a salesforce.com customer or prior salesforce.com Website visitor (whatever the
case may be).
We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information
stored in persistent cookies.

salesforce.com is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any
other third parties.
