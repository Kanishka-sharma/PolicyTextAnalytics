	intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to

	you know how we will use such information.
If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as 
	a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
