This section provides specific details of how we treat any personal data you provide us when you visit this website ("Site").
Data Security
Security is our top priority.
==========
We will strive at all times to ensure that your personal data will be protected against unauthorised or accidental access, processing or erasure.
We maintain this commitment to data security by implementing appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure your personal data.
The secure area of this Site supports the use of 128-bit Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet to protect data.
When you provide sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.
Our web servers are protected behind "firewalls" and our systems are monitored to prevent any unauthorised access.
==========
We will not send personal data to you by ordinary email.
As the security of ordinary email cannot be guaranteed, you should only send email to us using the secure email facility on this Site.
We will take all practical steps to ensure that personal data will not be kept longer than necessary and that we will comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region concerning the retention of personal data.
==========
Security Assurance
Both you and us play an important role in safeguarding against online fraud.
We endeavour to put in place high standards of security to protect your interests.
==========
You should be careful that your account details (including your username and password) are not compromised.
You should ensure that you do not knowingly or accidentally share, provide or facilitate unauthorised use of such details.
==========
Do not share your username or password or allow access or use of your username or password by others.
You should safeguard your username and password and keep them secret and confidential.
==========
Never write them down.
We will never ask you for your password given that you should be the only person who knows it.
When choosing your username and password, do not use easily identifiable information such as your birthday, telephone number or a recognisable part of your name.
If you think your username or password has been disclosed to another person, is lost or stolen or an unauthorised transaction has been conducted, you are responsible for informing us immediately.
If, in the unlikely event, an unauthorised transaction has been conducted through your account through no fraud, fault or negligence on your part, we will see that you are covered for your direct loss up to the full amount of the unauthorised transaction.
