What was I looking at?
The Amazon.com content that you were viewing is a type of link used by Amazon.com Associate Web sites to enable Amazon.com to deliver content directly to your browser.
Typically, when you look at a Web page, the words and pictures you see actually come from several sources.
Your browser software assembles the pieces and displays them as a single page.
==========
On the Associate Web site you were visiting, most of the content you saw was transmitted from server computers used by the site's operator.
However, the placement you just clicked on was different--we sent it to you directly from Amazon.com.
What is an Amazon.com Associate?
An Amazon Associate is a Web site owner who places links to the Amazon.com Web site on his or her site and earns referral fees through sales of Amazon.com products.

Although we may use your Amazon.com cookie to determine whether you are a recognized Amazon visitor and to offer personalized content (such as product recommendations) and special offers, we do not keep or attempt to construct a record of the Web sites you visit.

No.
==========
No personal information we may collect about customers who view, click, or purchase through Associate links is shared with third parties, including Associates, except as described by the Privacy Notice governing the Amazon.com Web site.
Are products listed on Amazon.com Associate Web sites through this linking service the same as the personalized recommendations I receive when visiting Amazon.com?
They can be.
==========
The products you see listed when visiting an Amazon Associate's site can be based on a variety of factors, such as that site's topics and sales history.
We might also show you items based on your own personal purchase history at Amazon.com.
The Associate Web site hosting this Amazon.com link does not have access to these "personalized" recommendations.
