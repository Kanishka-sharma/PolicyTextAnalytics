About RxList ®
Frequently Asked Questions:
Q.  Why does your RxList search 
                    find drug names I was not looking for?
A.
The search uses 'fuzzy' logic 
                    and attempts to match patterns similar to your input assuming 
                    you may not know how to spell the drug name you're searching 
                    for.
If you are certain of your spelling, an asterisk (*) 
                    placed in the search string (such as prozac*) will turn off 
                    the fuzzy logic feature and the search will perform exact 
                    pattern matches only.
If you type in the first few letters 
                    of a drug name without the asterisk (*) the search will match 
                    any brand or generic drug that matches that pattern and will 
                    also provide fuzzy results to increase the chances of finding 
                    your drug on the very first search.

Q.  I searched for a drug name 
                    but the only information I found was the brand name, generic 
                    name, and category.
Where's the rest of the information?
A.
There are approximately 5,000 
                    products listed in the RxList database.
==========
Of these, there are 
                    nearly 1000 professional monographs and about 1,500 patient 
                    oriented monographs.
RxList is adding new material all the 
                    time and strives to meet the needs of most of the users most 
                    of the time.
When RxList was founded in 1995, the only information 
                    was brand name, generic name, and category.
Q.  Can I purchase my prescriptions 
                    from RxList?
A.  RxList is not a licensed 
                    pharmacy and currently offers no products for sale.
Q.  I e-mailed a question to 
                    info@rxlist.com and received an auto-reply that said your 
                    policy is to not answer questions.
Why is that?
A.  RxList is run by a very small 
                    staff who keep pretty busy maintaining the site leaving little 
                    time to research your questions.
Q. What's your 
                    privacy policy?
