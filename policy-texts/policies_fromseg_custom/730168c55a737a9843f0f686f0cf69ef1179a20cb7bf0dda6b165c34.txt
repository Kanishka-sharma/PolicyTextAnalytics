Random Term From The Legal Dictionary
Rent
This is the consideration paid by a tenant to a landlord in exchange for the exclusive use and enjoyment of land, a building or a part of a building.
Under normal circumstances, the rent is paid in money and at regular intervals, such as the first of every month.
The word has also come to be used as a verb as in to "rent an apartment", although the proper legal term would be to "lease an apartment."
