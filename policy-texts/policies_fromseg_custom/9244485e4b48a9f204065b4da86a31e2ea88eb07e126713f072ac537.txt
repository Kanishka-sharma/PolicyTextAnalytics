To provide you with more innovative and relevant experiences and marketing messages based on your likely interests, we collect information about you and how you engage with us.
Adobe allows you to control your information in the following ways:










          
          Tell us which marketing messages are acceptable to you.
• Tell us your marketing preferences by editing your Adobe ID profile.
• If you do not have an Adobe account, email us at privacy@adobe.com to tell us your marketing preferences.
• Stop receiving Adobe marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of Adobe marketing emails.
You cannot opt out of certain emails we need to send you relating to normal business operations (for example, we may email you to inform you that your subscription is expiring or that someone has sent you a document using an Adobe online service).
Tell us not to use Adobe analytics and on-site personalization services on Adobe websites and online services.
We may use cookies to measure your use of Adobe websites and online services so that we can improve them, tailor our websites and online services to your likely interests, and perform market research.

          Tell us not to tailor Adobe ads shown to you on other websites.
Adobe sometimes runs online ad campaigns that involve showing you ads based on your likely interests gleaned from your activity on our websites and online services.
If you tell us not to send you these types of ads, you may still see Adobe ads on other companies' websites, but they will not be based on your activity on our websites and online services.
For more information about interest-based ads and your choices, visit these sites: Digital Advertising Alliance and Your Online Choices.
