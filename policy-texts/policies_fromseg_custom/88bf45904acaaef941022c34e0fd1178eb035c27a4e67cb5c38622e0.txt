Therefore, the protection of any data for advanced store GmbH and the advertising services operated under the ad4mat brand is of the highest and most important priority.
One of our principles is full respect for the right to informational self-determination.
==========
advanced store feels bound by the German and European law on data protection without any limitation.
In addition, advanced store adheres strictly to the principles of the EDAA.
==========
Thus, we herewith inform you about the handling of data at advanced store.
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address or telephone number of a data subject, is always conducted in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to advanced store GmbH; in particular in accordance with the legal permissions according to Art. 6 (1) lit.

By means of this Privacy Policy we would like to inform you about the nature, extent and purpose of the personal data collected, used and processed by us.
Furthermore, data subjects are informed of their rights under this Privacy Policy.

Cookies & pixel
We store so-called "cookies" in order to offer you a comprehensive range of functions and to make the use of our website more comfortable.
"Cookies" are small files that are stored on your computer using your Internet browser.
If you do not wish to use "cookies", you may opt for changing appropriate settings of your Internet browser in regard to the saving of “cookies”.
Please note that the functionality and scope of functions of our offer may be limited.
In addition, we separate and if necessary use from third party, so-called tracking pixels.
==========
Tracking pixels are small graphics on web pages that enable log file recording and log file analysis, and that are often used for statistical analysis.
The so-called tracking pixels can be integrated on our pages.
When you visit our pages, a direct connection between your browser and a server of ours or the third party can be established via the tracking pixel.
We or the third party receive thereby e.g. information from your browser that our website was called from your device.
If you are a registered user of the third party, this can thereby assign the visit of our pages to your user account.
We point out that as the provider of the website we are not aware of the content of the transmitted data and their use by the third party.
==========
We can only choose which segments (such as age, interests) our ad should display.
By the call of the pixel from your browser, we or the third party can tell if an ad was successful.
This allows us to record the effectiveness of the advertisements for statistical and market research purposes.

==========
Logfiles / Collection of general data and information
The website of advanced store GmbH captures a series of general data and information each time the website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system.
This general data and information is stored in the log files of the server.
The following information can be recorded:
                               (1) used browser types and versions,
(2) the operating system used by the accessing system,
(3) the website, from which an accessing system comes to our website (so-called referrer),
(4) the sub-web pages, which are accessed via an accessing system on our website,
(5) the date and time of access to the website,
(6) an internet protocol address (IP address),
(7) the internet service provider of the accessing system,
(8) other similar data and information used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
When using this general data and information, advanced store GmbH does not draw conclusions about the data subject.
==========
Rather, this information is required to (1) correctly deliver the contents of our website, (2) to optimize the content of our website and to advertise it, (3) to ensure the continued functioning of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, and (4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for law enforcement in the event of a cyberattack.
This anonymously collected data and information is evaluated by the advanced store GmbH on the one hand statistically and further with the aim to increase the data protection and data security in our company to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data processed by us.
==========
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data is Art. 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.
For these purposes, our legitimate interest in the processing of data according to Art. 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.
==========
The data contained in logfiles will be deleted at the latest after seven days.
The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
6.
==========
Contact possibility via the website
The website of advanced store GmbH contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our company, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address).
If a data subject contacts the Controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored.
Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data Controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.
There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.
For the purpose of transmitting data via the contact form, Contact Form 7 Plugin is used.
7.
==========
Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
We, as the data Controller, process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the Controller is subject to.
If the purpose for the storage is not applicable or valid anymore, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.
8.
==========
Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
On this website, the Controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (incl.
the anonymization function).
Google Analytics is a web analytics service.
Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behaviour of visitors to websites.
A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.
==========
Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.
For the web analytics through Google Analytics, the Controller uses the application "_gat.
_anonymizeIp".
==========
By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymised by Google when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the traffic on our website.
Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
==========
The definition of cookies is explained above.
With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyse the use of our website.
With each call to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the Controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.
During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.
==========
The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.
With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.
==========
These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.
Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
==========
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
==========
Furthermore, the data subject has the option of objecting to and preventing the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics for the use of this website and the processing of this data by Google.
To do this, the data subject must download and install a browser add-on at the link below.
This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about website visits may be transmitted to Google Analytics.
The installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as a formal contradiction.
==========
If the data subject's information technology system is later deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the data subject must re-install the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics.
If the browser add-on is uninstalled or disabled by the data subject or any other person within their control, you may reinstall or re-enable the browser add-on.
You can download this browser add-on here.
==========
Opt-out cookies prevent the future collection of your data when you visit this website.
To prevent Universal Analytics tracking across devices, you must opt-out on all systems you use.
You activate the opt out cookie here: Opt Out Google Analytics.
The use of Google Analytics is based on our legitimate interest in an appropriate design, the statistical evaluation and the efficient application of our website and the fact that your legitimate interests do not predominate, Art. 6 (1) lit.

==========
Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords
advanced store GmbH may from time to time integrate Google AdWords on this website.
Google AdWords is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to run both Google and Google Network search engine results.
Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-set keywords that will display an ad on Google's search engine results only when the search engine retrieves a keyword-related search result.
In the Google Network, ads are distributed on topical web pages using an automated algorithm and according to predefined keywords.
The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.
==========
The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website.
If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google.
==========
The definition of cookies is explained above.
A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject.
If the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g., the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called on our website.
Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the Controller, can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, i.e. whether the person executed or cancelled a sale of goods.
The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website.
These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future.
==========
Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.
The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject.
Each time visiting our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America.
These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.
Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
==========
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertisement of Google.
Therefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link https://adssettings.google.de/authenticated and set the personally desired settings.
==========
The use of Google AdWords is based on our legitimate interest in an appropriate design, the statistical evaluation and the efficient application of our website and the fact that your legitimate interests do not predominate, Art. 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

Data protection provisions about the application and use of Akismet Anti-Spam Check
Our online offering uses the "Akismet" service offered by Automattic, Inc. 132 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.
==========
The use is based on our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.
==========
With the help of this service, comments of real people are distinguished from spam comments.
All comment information is sent to a server in the US, where it is analysed and stored for four days for comparison.
If a comment has been classified as spam, the data will be stored beyond that time.
This information includes the name entered, the email address, the IP address, the comment content, the referrer, details of the browser used, the computer system and the time of the entry.
==========
Automatic is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation.
For more information about the collection and use of data by Akismet, see the Automattic Privacy Notice.
Users are welcome to use pseudonyms, or to refrain from entering the name or email address.
You can completely prevent the transfer of data by not using our commenting system.
That would be a shame, but unfortunately we see no other alternatives that work equally effectively.
==========
The use of Akismet is based on our legitimate interest in avoiding misuse an appropriate and the efficient application of our website and services and the fact that your legitimate interests do not predominate, Art. 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.

Google Fonts
We incorporate the fonts "Google Fonts" provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
This website includes external fonts from Google Fonts.
Google Fonts is a service of Google Inc. (USA).

13.
==========
Period for which the personal data will be stored
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
14.
==========
Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.
The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.
The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.
The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
15.
==========

About advanced store’s services 
advanced store specialises in creating and delivering interest-based advertising.
We collaborate with online partners (called “partners” or “publishers”) in order to present advertising to users who visit these partners’ websites.
Our collaboration with these publishers enables us to present targeted and customised advertising, which is based on users’ past activities.
Our mission is to show you the most interesting advertising and products possible.
==========
Our technology enables us to develop usage parameters on the basis of your surfing and search behaviour, which facilitates this targeted and relevant advertising.
We are pleased to illustrate this using a simple example relating to a product display using our technologies: When you visit an online shop that appeals to you for a provider of products or services and subsequently continue surfing on an informative website (magazine, blog or similar), optimised advertising, which is based on your past surfing / usage behaviour, will be displayed to you on this site.
For example, if you visit a fashion brand’s website and are also connected to a social media site, you will see an advertisement for this fashion brand on the social media site.
About advanced store’s technology
We collect information about your surfing behaviour using tracking cookies and similar technology, which are placed in the user’s browser.
In this way, we can analyse trends and identify a user’s individual interests based on the websites they have visited.
In your browser’s settings, you can control the use of cookies yourself very easily using the opt-out and preferences options and thereby tailor this to your own usage.
==========
However, we would like to point out that if you decide to opt out, this does not mean that you will see less advertising, but that you will only see advertising, which is not interest-based.
advanced store uses cookies to identify visitors to each of our partners’ websites and assigns an ID to each visitor.
It is important to note that we do not collect any personal data at any point, through which you could be identified (e.g. name or postal address).
Furthermore, the cookies are saved in your browser and are not stored by us.
Even if the cookie ID were taken as the basis for a possible interpretation of a person’s identity, we assume that in this scenario we would process this personal data in a way that is authorised and respects the affected person’s protection needs according to art. 6, para.
==========
1 lit.
f GDPR.
==========
Your search behaviour and the websites you visit form the basis for the delivery of our advertising.
It is also likely that our partners will occasionally place their own cookies in your browser to optimise the use of advertisements from their side.
==========
In this case, you can obtain further information regarding the respective publishers’ data protection policies from their websites.
Retargeting
In order to be able to display personalised advertising to you, we save the product data that you have viewed when visiting a website in a cookie.
Using our technology, advertisements that are customised according to your cookie are displayed to you while you browse.
==========
This means that we guarantee that you only see advertising that is relevant to you without having to process personal data, such as your name, address, date of birth or log-in details.
Within the scope of our data handling process our retargeting cookie may call up a sub-cookie, which has been placed in your browser by one of our partners.
This sub-cookie allows us to define a target group of users with similar interests.
==========
In this way, we can also systematically display content to an interest group.
When advertisements are displayed to a target group, the interests of individuals are never considered, but rather the interests of anonymised, standardised groups of people.
==========
We only process statistical patterns, which are generated by the anonymous use of online advertising and editorial content.
We store these patterns and use them to identify individual user groups, who have visited the same type of sites or have made purchases.
It is also impossible for individual users to be identified during this process.
On the contrary, the process involves assigning a blue dot to a user group, so that the server knows that this user may find a brand’s advertising interesting.
Collecting and processing data 
Who are you?
We at advanced store do not know who you are.
We only collect and process technical information, which is based on your surfing behaviour.
Why?
==========
We use this to be able to display advertising that is as interesting and relevant to you as possible.
In particular, the cookie ID mentioned above plays an important role in this.
What we do process is information on general surfing behaviour.
==========
We are very rigorous in ensuring that we never knowingly gather data, which could be used to identify a person (e.g. name, address, telephone number, etc.).
We only collect information on your surfing behaviour.
==========
The following is recorded for this purpose:
Your activity on our partners’ websites.
For example, this includes the number of sites viewed, the products viewed on this website and any searches you carried out on this website.
The delivery of advertising displays by advanced store, for example the number of displays shown to you with the same content or content from the same advertisers.
==========
Data collected by our trusted partners
In addition to our own data, we sometimes use product or other data from third party providers (third party cookies).
These improve the synchronisation between the server and the browser and provide you with a seamless online experience.
Our partners have committed to only collecting and processing information relating to surfing behaviour (websites visited, website categories, search field entries and product details).
==========
Furthermore, we expect all of our partners to provide an easy option for end users to opt-out of their data being collected or processed.
We permit our partners to use the following tools to collect data:
1.
==========
Container tags
Container tags enable the efficient use of several pixels from different providers and partners without having to amend the programming after every change made to the website.
They are mainly used by affiliate networks, which serve a large number of partners.
As part of this affiliate network, we use the data from container tags to be able to display relevant advertising to you.
2.
==========
DoubleClick and programmatic buying
We use several platforms to display our advertisements.
For this, we purchase programmatic ad placement from publishers on the market places of different providers.
This ad placement is assigned using a bid process.
The value of ad placement is based on how current and relevant it is for the user.
This implies that data is made available to the publisher and the user and can be processed.
3.
==========
Subcontractors, affiliate networks & partners 
advanced store collaborates with selected subcontractors on many areas.
In the course of our collaboration, these companies receive restricted access to user data within the scope of GDPR.
==========
Furthermore, a large number of affiliate networks and publisher partners belong to the subcontractors with which we collaborate.
Affiliate networks, such as AWIN, Adcell and Affilinet connect publishers (also called affiliates or partners) with advertising clients in order to market products and services to specific target groups.
We use these networks’ platforms for reporting, billing, technical development and communications with our partners.
==========
The placement of our ads by exclusive marketing partners, such as eBay Advertising, Scout24 and Ströer, also enables the best possible placement on the most popular and well-known websites on both mobile devices and desktop computers.
We carry out maximum performance online marketing for our clients in collaboration with the following partners.
==========
We cannot identify you 
Again, for the purpose of full transparency: Contrary to the common misgivings that arise on hearing that “data is stored”, we do not know who you are.
We do not know your name, your date of birth or your address, let alone your employer or any similar information.
==========
Furthermore, we do not collect any confidential or sensitive information about you relating to your health or your political views.
We also do not collect any data, which allows children under the age of 16 to be targeted.
If this situation changes in the context of one of our partner’s campaigns, we will provide you with in-depth information on this website relating to how and for what purpose children are targeted.
==========
We collect information with the aim of increasing the relevance of the advertising shown to you.
In addition, we may use your data in reports or to provide our clients and partners with more information on the performance of their ad campaigns and how these can be improved.
==========
Working with Google Analytics, social media plugins & Co.
In addition to cookies, we use other market-standard techniques to control and improve our Internet presence.
For this, we use tools, such as Google Analytics or plugins from social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+, as applicable.
You can find extensive details on the programming of cookies and tools and the options to deactivate these in our Data Protection Policy.
==========
Transfer of aggregated data
In order to ensure the best possible performance of the campaigns we run, we may transfer aggregated data to our subsidiaries or partner companies.
Aggregated data does not allow the identification of the participating parties.
==========
We enter into partnerships with marketers in order to purchase ad placements for use in the context of advanced store’s activities.
We advertise online using ad placements, which are for sale and for which we actively bid, and we transfer the banner code to be displayed.
==========
Technical data security
The user data we collect is stored for 12 months from the point of collection.
Our cookies become invalid 12 months after they were last updated.
==========
Furthermore, we have voluntarily submitted ourselves for self-regulation as part of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA).
You can view the Self-Regulation Code for this using the following link: https://www.youronlinechoices.com.
You can manage your preferences relating to usage-based online advertising (Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA)) very easily in the Preferences Management area.
==========
Legal notices
In certain situations, advanced store may be obligated to disclose data in response to official requests from authorities relating to national security or criminal prosecution.
As prescribed by law, we also disclose our information in order to comply with a court order or within the context of a court case, for example.
We may also transfer your personal information if we are confident in good faith that this is in the best interests of your security or that of another person, if it is necessary for investigating cases of fraud or if we are obliged to respond to a request from a regulation body.
==========
We reserve the right to disclose your personal data in the context of a merger, business acquisition, business dissolution or as part of the sale of assets.
Should changes be made to the company’s ownership structure, the use of your personal data or your options for influencing this, we will inform you of this by email and/or via a very clear announcement on our website.
==========
Data protection regulations relating to the application and use of advanced store
We use various technologies from advanced store GmbH, Alte Jakobstraße 79/80, 10179 Berlin, Germany, for the optimised playout of relevant advertising material.

Glossary
We use the following terms in this Data Protection Policy: 
a. Personal data 
Personal data is all information that is used or can be used to identify a natural person (hereinafter “affected person”).
==========
Being able to identify a natural person is considered as the direct or indirect identification, in particular by means of the assignment of an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online ID or one or more specific characteristics, which express the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person.
b. Affected person 
The affected person is any natural person who is identified or can be identified and whose personal data is processed by the party responsible for data processing.
==========
c. Processing 
Processing is any operation carried out with or without the use of automated processes or any such operation sequence relating to personal data, such as the creation, collection, organisation, sorting, storage, amendment or modification, reading, retrieval, use, disclosure by transfer, distribution or another form of supply, reconciliation or combination, restriction, deletion or destruction of data.
d. Processing restriction 
Processing restriction is the labelling of stored personal data with the aim of restricting its future processing.
==========
e. Profiling 
Profiling is any type of automated processing of personal data, which involves using this personal data to assess certain personal aspects that relate to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to the job performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, place of residence or change of location of this natural person.
f. Pseudonymisation 
Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in a way in which personal data can no longer be assigned to a specific affected person without using additional information, as long as this additional information is stored separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures, which ensure that the personal data cannot lead to the identification or possible identification of a natural person.
==========
g. Responsible parties or parties responsible for processing 
Responsible parties or parties responsible for processing are natural persons or legal entities, authorities, institutions or other agencies, who are responsible for deciding the purpose and means of processing for personal data, either alone or together with other people.
If the purpose and means of processing are prescribed under European Union law or the laws of the member states, the responsible parties, or rather the specific criteria, can stipulate its designation according to European Union law or the laws of the member states.
h. Data processors 
Data processors are natural persons or legal entities, authorities, institutions or other agencies, which process the personal data on behalf of the responsible parties.
i. Empfänger
Recipients are natural persons or legal entities, authorities, institutions or other agencies, to which personal data is disclosed, irrespective of whether or not they are third parties.
Authorities, which may receive personal data in the context of a specific investigation mandate under European Union law or the laws of member states, do not count as recipients.
j. Third parties
Third parties are natural persons or legal entities, authorities, institutions or other agencies other than the affected person, the responsible parties, the data processors and the people who are authorised under the direct responsibility of the responsible parties or the data processors, which process personal data.
k. Consent
Consent is any willingness expressed voluntarily for a specific situation in an informed manner and unambiguously in the form of a declaration or another action clearly confirming willingness, with which the affected person enables it to be understood that they agree to the processing of their personal data.

==========
Amendments to our data protection policy as well as to this guidance
We would like to alert you to the fact that we amend and update our Data Protection Policy and this guidance in the event of innovations.
If amendments are made, we will publish these on this site and on other sites.
==========
Notes for our partners
On 25th of May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation, for short GDPR, was officially entering into force.
The regulation adopted by the European Union will regulate the handling of personal data in the future and apply uniformly to all EU companies.
Since advanced store handles with data responsibly, we have already implemented the requirements of the GDPR.
For this purpose, we have revised our privacy policy, clarified further explanations on the use of data to make it clear and understandable, published a list of cooperation partners and created the opportunity to opt-out.
==========
Basics
We use the user ID for our services in order to measure user’s behaviour and to be able to display advertising in a targeted, fair and performance-optimized manner.
Even if our user ID contains only pseudonymous information, it is likely to be assigned to the category “personal” according to the interpretation of the GDPR.
Approach & strategy
According to the current state of the discussions and statements, we assume that our services are legitimated according to Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR on the “legitimate interest”.
The following points speak for this:
Processing of pseudonymous data
comprehensive information on the website
expected knowledge of the user about the processing
no profound interference with the personality right
interest of the user already announced before
easy opt-out possibility
In the interpretation and balancing of interests, we rely in particular on the user’s regular expectation that when surfing the internet and on visited pages, he gets advertisements for products that he has viewed in another shop and for which he has already been interested.
==========
Online advertising is in this sense no longer a surprise for the user.
The connection between ads that are tailored to the interests of the user, and the processing of data is obvious to the user.
What is to do?
==========
In our privacy policy and in the additional information you can inform yourself in detail about our services and the technology used.
Both documents contain a direct link to the opt-out as well as the list of all our current cooperation partners.
==========
Although we cannot provide legal advice, we recommend pointing out the cooperation with us in the privacy policy, e.g.: with the following snippet:
“For the optimal displaying relevant advertising media and advertising campaigns advanced store GmbH, Alte Jakobstr 79/80, 10179 Berlin, is collecting, using ad4mat technology, on this page pseudonymous information and data about the surfing behaviour of users.
This is done by storing a randomly generated pseudonymous user ID in your computer's LocalStorage.
==========
advanced store uses these data which continue to exist and can be read even after you close the browser window - provided you do not delete the cache – in order to analyse your surfing behaviour based on a special algorithm and specifically relevant on other websites, e.g. to recommend products and offers according to your interest through advertising banners.
The data, these are the addresses (URLs) of the web pages you have visited on this website, is only used to optimize the recommended advertising content, the website user is not personally identified.
Third parties cannot access the data stored in the local storage.
advanced store GmbH is committed to the European industry standard for online behavioural advertising, the EDAA.
For more information and preference management, visit https://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
The services of advanced store GmbH are based on Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR.
If you want to object to the use of pseudonymous cookie IDs and the corresponding analysis of your surfing behaviour, then you have the opportunity here.
You will also find further information here and the privacy policy of advanced store GmbH.”
In addition, we recommend that you have your own data processing analysis of your page or your product carried out by your data protection officer or lawyer.
We all know that a lot is currently “in flux” and that further interpretations or corrections of the GDPR might follow.
Should any questions remain unanswered, we are always at your disposal for personal discussions.
==========
Our tools and opt-outs
In order to fulfil our services in the best possible way, depending on the campaign objective, other tools may be used in addition to our own advanced store technology, which in turn set their own cookies.
As we are committed to transparency, we list the tools in question here, including provider contact data, data protection declarations and opt-out options.
==========
Important: Please note that the respective partner may have changed their web presence and thus also the landing page with the opt-out.
We will update this page as soon as we become aware of such a change.

Advertising banners & cookie usage
The vast majority of internet pages are able to provide internet users information, services and en-tertainment free of charge because they are financed through advertising revenue.
==========
The website operators choose advertising partners for this purpose, who can generate this income for them and who offer reliable and confidential services.
advanced store is one of the most frequently chosen advertising partners in Europe because our excellent brand mix provides the greatest possible benefit for the website operator on the one hand, and on the other hand unites the consumer with relevant offers and promotions.
Thus both sides are united profitably with one another.
==========
Why cookies or similar technologies?
advanced store wants to show you advertising that matches your interests.
==========
This is why our banners use anonymised information on users’ surfing behaviour on the websites of our advertising client’s web pages.
This information is stored as a pseudonymized UserID in your browser’s LocalStorage.
All data collected during visits to websites and online offers is 100% anonymous.
==========
Nevertheless, they help to make advertising much more relevant to you.
However, we respect your wish not to receive personalized advertising.
If you do not want this kind of advertising, you have the option to place an opt-out cookie.
We will then no longer display interest-based advertising on you, i.e. advertising offers will no longer be based on websites you previously visited.
Further information can be found under privacy policy.
Opt out: deactivate interest-based advertisements
You are able to generally deactivate usage-based banners from us.
==========
To do this, please click on “opt-out” below.
This opt-out option relates to the advanced store service and will not stop displaying advertising banners from other companies.
Please also note that not all browsers support this opt-out function!
