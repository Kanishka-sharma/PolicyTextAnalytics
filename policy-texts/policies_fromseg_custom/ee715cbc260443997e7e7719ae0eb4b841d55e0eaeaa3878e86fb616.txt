Macromedia and your privacy
At Macromedia we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to macromedia.com, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences.
For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of macromedia.com, download free software, request new information, or subscribe to the Macromedia EDGE newsletter.
We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on macromedia.com (and related Macromedia sites) are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.
When you provide Macromedia with your name (or alias), mailing address, or telephone number, Macromedia and Macromedia representatives may use your postal address and phone number to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, and new services.
==========
("Representatives" include value-added resellers and authorized training partners.)
When you provide Macromedia with your e-mail address (as an alternative to, or in addition to, your mailing address and phone number), Macromedia may contact you via e-mail.
Macromedia never releases e-mail addresses to its representatives.
==========
Macromedia also does not offer, or allow for the selling of, any user-provided information to third parties.
If you do not want Macromedia or Macromedia representatives to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting Macromedia directly.
As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt [back] in and have Macromedia contact you based on your previous or new preferences.
For detailed instructions, please see the section "Contact Us," below.
==========
If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most of Macromedia's Web sites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.
Macromedia membership
Macromedia offers free membership to all macromedia.com visitors.
In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide both personal information and preferences.
This information is stored and protected by your user-established Member ID and Password.
==========
There is an additional "Remember Me" option.
By selecting it, you allow Macromedia to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you return to any Macromedia Web site.
Macromedia remembers you by placing a log file (cookie) that contains only enough information to identify you upon return visits.
A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps Macromedia provide better service to you.
Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent.
==========
No information, other than that found in the cookie, will be accessed by any Macromedia system.
Access to your user information always requires both your Member ID and Password.
How Macromedia will protect your personal information
Macromedia will always protect the personal information that you share with us.
Macromedia stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment.
==========
If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit card number only to secure your current payment.
The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand, and will not use the number for marketing purposes.
If Macromedia requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous.
Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.
Macromedia may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company.
To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information.
If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.
==========
DoubleClick Banner Advertisements
We use an outside ad company, DoubleClick, to serve ads on our Web site.
In the process of serving ads, DoubleClick places a DoubleClick cookie in your browser's cookie file.
By delivering ads on the macromedia.com site, DoubleClick is able to record what ads a browser (identified by the unique cookie) has seen, and what macromedia.com Web site pages the browser was viewing when the ads were delivered.
This Web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information DoubleClick has (e.g. what type of operating system your computer uses).
The information is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to target the ads you see online.
Unlike the cookies macromedia.com uses in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by DoubleClick and we do not have access to this information.
We recognize that not all users wish to receive ads targeted to their interests and we put the wishes of our users first.
==========
We want you to have the choice.
If you want to learn more about DoubleClick's ad serving, privacy policies and the use of cookies, please visit the DoubleClick site at www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/.
