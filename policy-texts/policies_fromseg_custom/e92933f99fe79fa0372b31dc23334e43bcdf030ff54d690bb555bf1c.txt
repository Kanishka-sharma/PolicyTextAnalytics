Collection of Personal Information

This information is provided to the advertiser or publisher who sponsored the ad or its authorized service provider and is not used or retained by Flashtalking for any other purpose.
The advertiser or publisher’s collection and use of personal information is governed by such advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy.
Flashtalking is not responsible for the privacy or information practices of its advertiser or publisher partners.
Flashtalking does not collect or use any sensitive data for advertising purposes, including social security numbers or other government issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, sexual orientation, or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions.

We do not target any ads based on any health-related topics.
