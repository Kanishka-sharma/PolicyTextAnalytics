==========
Please review "Your choices about collection and use of your information" below.
With whom we share your information
We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our web site or while using our services.
Personal information.
We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared.
We may share personal information with:
Authorized service providers: We may share your personal information with our authorized third party service providers that perform certain services on our behalf.
==========
These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, providing users with email addresses and email service, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website.
These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information (except, possibly, on an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis) for any other purposes.
Business partners: When you make purchases, reservations or engage in promotions offered through our website or our services, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes.
When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant.
==========
In addition, special sponsor promotions may often involve a request for information or a grant of permission to share personal information.
By submitting this information or participating in the promotion, you give MyWay permission to transfer this information to the sponsor or as otherwise stipulated in connection with the rules or privacy policy applicable to the promotion.
You should review any applicable sweepstakes and promotion rules or user agreement to see what is being shared.
If personal information about you will be shared, we will disclose this to you before we collect or transfer the information.
==========
Direct mail partners: From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you.
If you prefer not to receive mailings you may update your mail preferences by going to the My Account page, which allows you to access and edit your registration account information.
In addition, you may contact MyWay Customer Service to update your profile (account information and preferences).
==========
Other IAC businesses.
We are part of the IAC family of businesses (go to www.iac.com for a listing of these businesses).
We may share information we collect, including personal information, with other IAC companies.
Sharing information with our IAC companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.
All IAC companies comply with privacy policies available at each company's site.
IAC companies also comply with applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future.
==========
Other Situations.
We also may disclose your information:
In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
==========
In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information.
Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties.
These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.
==========
Aggregated and non-personal information.
We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances.
We may also share it with third parties and other IAC companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties.
We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources.
We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.
For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed.
==========
This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.
Non-personal information (such as your user name and recent contests, games and sweepstakes you have won) is publicly viewable via your user profile on the MyWay Site.
Any visitor to the MyWay Site can view any users' profile pages.
This is one reason why we recommend not using your real name as your user name.
==========
Third-party websites
There are a number of places on the MyWay Site or MyWay Services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control.
These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information from you, including personal information, and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites.
We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
==========
We offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by MyWay and selected companies.
In many cases, these co-branded services will contain MyWay branding, but may not be hosted by MyWay.
You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by", if standard MyWay branding is not displayed on the top of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information.
In such cases, if you use the co-branded service, MyWay may be entitled to receive information about what you do when using that service.
If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service.
==========
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
How you can access your information 

If you have registered with the MyWay Site, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account.
You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us.
More information about how to contact us is provided below.
If you have registered with the MyWay Site you also may choose to close your account at any time by clicking here.
==========
You will need to be signed into the member account that you would like to cancel.
If you are not currently signed into an account, you will be prompted to so do during the cancellation process.
You will also see the option to only cancel your MyWay email address, and not your entire MyWay registration, if this is your intention.
Please note that it may take up to 48 hours for your cancellation request to be processed.
==========
If you are unable to sign in to cancel your account, please visit our lost password page at the following URL: http://bfc.MyWay.com/ur/meminfo_idpass.html?PG=home&SEC;=foot.
After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information.
However, you can open a new account at any time.
==========
If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.
Your choices about collection and use of your information 
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in your inability to use or access certain features of the MyWay Site or MyWay Services; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.
==========
At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by going to the My Account page and editing your preferences with respect to the receipt of commercial or promotional emails or by contacting customer service.
When you register on our website, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive e-mail messages about new features, events, and special offers.
You may modify your choice at any time on the My Account page or by contacting customer service.
You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future.
It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.
We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us.
==========
If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by going to the My Account page and editing your preferences with respect to the sharing of information or by contacting customer service.
How we protect your personal information 
	We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
==========
We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
==========
Forums
The MyWay Site may offer various Forums -- areas for users to engage in public commentary or discussion, where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others.
Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service.
In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.
==========
Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages.
We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Once you have posted information, you will not be able to edit or delete such information.
==========

If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
