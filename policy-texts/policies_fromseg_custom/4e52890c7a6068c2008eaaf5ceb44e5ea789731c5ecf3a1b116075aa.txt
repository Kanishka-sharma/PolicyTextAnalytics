This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information on our privacy and data protection policies over and above the legal requirement.
For nugg.ad AG predictive behavioral targeting (nugg.ad), the protection of all forms of data is of utmost importance.
nugg.ad lives with and from the use of data, but above all from the trust given to us by our customers and our sensitive handling of their data.
==========
Our inviolable principles on data protection include the uncompromising respect for the right of informational self-determination of each citizen.
nugg.ad is uncompromisingly committed to the legal regulations on privacy and data protection in Germany and Europe and, moreover, to perceived privacy requirements.
This is why we would like to take this opportunity to inform you about how we handle data at nugg.ad, and the importance of data to our technology.
1.
What data do we record and process?
==========
nugg.ad offers website providers a technology that enables them to deliver interest-based advertising.
nugg.ad’s interest-based advertising is useful to advertisers because it increases the effectiveness of advertising.
It reduces the number of adverts placed, so that you as a user benefit from being shown less advertising, and what you do see is more likely to be relevant to your areas of interest as opposed to random insertion of advertising.
==========
nugg.ad achieves this by using general information based on your internet use.
To do this nugg.ad’s technology monitors the usage pattern of internet users by storing a cookie in the browser of your user device with a lifespan of 26 weeks: this means the number of website hits in various subject areas is counted.
nugg.ad stores aggregated information about usage patterns with a hashed ID in the nugg.ad system.
In other words the specific internet addresses you have visited are not recorded, but nugg.ad stores the frequency of use for various subject areas based on web pages accessed in a cookie (more information about this below under Point 3.)
.
This general information about your internet use can be used by nugg.ad’s technology comprehensively across websites.
==========
Sensitive areas such as religion, health or sexuality are not monitored.
Furthermore no other data is recorded.
In particular nugg.ad never stores information relating to your name, postal address, email or IP address.
We use data protection-friendly technology and a sophisticated anonymisation system, which means that we have no way of finding out who the user viewing a particular page actually is.
Data is never passed on to third parties, such as to the local authorities or other companies.
==========
Furthermore nugg.ad carries out surveys of customers on the websites.
These surveys are voluntary, unpaid and the user questioned can stop at any point.
The information gathered through this means is stored in the nugg.ad system together with a hashed ID.
We will never ask you questions about your ethnic origin, your political opinion, your religious/philosophical views, your trade union activities, your health or your sexual habits.
We will also never include these categories when analysing your user behaviour.
==========
Special precautions are taken in the nugg.ad system to comply with the principle of data economy.
In particular it is ensured, through an anonymising service operated by an independent party, that no user IP addresses enter the nugg.ad system.
Specific technical and contractual arrangements also ensure that this anonymising protection service cannot be circumvented by nugg.ad staff.
2.
Target groups and campaign management
nugg.ad identifies relevant target groups for advertising, according to socio-demographic criteria and product interests.
We make use of statistical patterns only, which are created by the behaviour of users towards online advertising and editorial content published on websites.
==========
To ensure that you are not constantly bombarded with the same advertisements or even feel that they are too intrusive, we count how frequently you are shown an advert in various campaigns.
Once you reach a certain level of exposure, you will not be shown any more adverts from that campaign.
3.

nugg.ad uses cookies.
