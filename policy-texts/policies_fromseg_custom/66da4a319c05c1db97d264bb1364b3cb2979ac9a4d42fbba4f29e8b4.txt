From time-to-time, Zazzle may provide its sellers with the first name and city/state/country of residence of Zazzle customers who have purchased such seller's products.

What about Children's Privacy?
==========
Children under the age of 13 are allowed to upload graphics and images and to order products with their parent's consent.
To order products, the child must indicate his or her age, submit his or her name and his or her mailing address and shipping address if different from the mailing address together with a valid credit card number.
In addition, in order to generate custom postage, we must collect and record the following information: the date and time of the custom postage order, a unique order i.d., the amount of postage ordered in the transaction, and the zip code of the recipient of the custom postage.
This is the only information collected from a child.
This information is used to fulfill the requested order; confirm shipment; complete record keeping including royalty entitlements and pay royalty fees, if any, to report the sale of custom postage to the United States Postal Service, and to advise the child concerning new Zazzle products, services or policies.
==========
Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to consent to the collection of this information from their children or not.
Such consent will not be used as consent for the dissemination of any of this information and the information will not be released by Zazzle to third parties without the parents' consent except as may be required by law or upon court order.
Personal information at Zazzle is kept confidential and is disclosed only with the consent of the Zazzle user or as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We do not engage in the selling of the habits, behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our users.
==========
Zazzle does not condition a child's participation in any on-line activity on the granting of any unnecessary information beyond that actually needed in connection with that activity.
Parents can review any information Zazzle has received from a child and the parent can have that information deleted and the parent can forbid the collection of additional information from their child.
If you want to review any information obtained from your child or if you want to have any information obtained from your child deleted from the Zazzle records or to forbid any use of such information, you may send a request to Zazzle Customer Support by logging into Zazzle, going to:
Contact Us, and sending an email relating to Parental Notification.
