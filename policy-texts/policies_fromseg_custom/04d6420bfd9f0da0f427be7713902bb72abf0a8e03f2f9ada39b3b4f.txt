Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice
Zendesk has certified compliance with the U.S. – EU and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.
Zendesk and the other entities that comprise the Zendesk Group are committed to adherence to the principles set forth in these frameworks regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland as well as related principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.
We frequently enter agreements with our customers located in the EEA to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers.
In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the Service (including to respond to support requests), as otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law.
==========
We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection.
Our EEA or Switzerland based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive.
In particular, Zendesk’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EEA member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing.
==========
We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.
As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service.
In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described above under the section above entitled, “Protection of Information”.
Hosting and Data Transfer
Unless we expressly agree otherwise (including through our Terms of Service), we may host and process data, including personal information, in the United States and in other countries through the Zendesk Group and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service.
When you access or use the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized Agents or End-Users, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence.
==========
Choice
We process and store information on behalf of our customers.
Zendesk has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service.

We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service.
Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the Terms of Service with our customers.
