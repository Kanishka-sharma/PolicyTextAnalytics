Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting an International Trade Administration (ITA) web site.
==========
ITA promotes U.S. exports and American manufacturing and services industries, protects U.S. business interests abroad, safeguards American industries and jobs against unfair trade, and enforces U.S. trade laws.
In support of these activities, ITA operates the Export.Gov trade portal and other websites that occasionally collect business or personal information from our customers.
We do not collect this type of information without the voluntary consent of the site visitor.
ITA and the Department of Commerce extends the same protection to business identifiable information that is afforded to personally identifiable information.
The main purpose of this policy is to inform our visitors that you have rights under the Privacy Act, that all business or personal information provided to ITA is on a voluntary basis, and that information provided will be protected to the extent permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Freedom of Information Act of 1966.
At each location where information is collected, we make every effort to explain explicitly how the information you provide will be used, and we allow you to determine if you consent to provide such information.
For more information on the Freedom of Information Act and your rights under the Privacy Act please visit the Federal Citizen Information Center site.
All information submitted by visitors is voluntary.

The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to websites maintained by or on behalf of ITA.
Generally, ITA websites do not provide content for children and we do not collect personally identifiable information from children.
Other organizations in the Federal government and the Department of Commerce may have slightly different practices, though the over arching commitment to your privacy will always be the same.
