The use of cookies is common on the Internet.

Cookies help IGN and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements.
Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate, or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings.
==========
This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences.
In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well.
We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best.
We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you.
You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the IGN Sites.

Access to Other Sites Through IGN
Our Affiliates Sites.

These sites are identified as our "Affiliates" and/or - "Partner Sites" These sites are not owned or operated by IGN, but are part of a larger network of sites with which the IGN Sites share content and advertising opportunities.
We do not share Personally Identifiable Information of our members with these Affiliate Sites.
Linking to Other Sites.
You may also visit independent web sites, not operated by IGN, that are connected to our network for our users.
Such sites are operated by external, third-party service providers.
Some of these sites will have their own separate membership processes and privacy policies.
The IGN Sites do not control sites that are operated by others and so cannot be responsible for the information practices of these sites.
==========
Other sites may set their own cookies, collect data or solicit personal information.
It is always a good idea to check the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of any site before offering any of your personal information.
