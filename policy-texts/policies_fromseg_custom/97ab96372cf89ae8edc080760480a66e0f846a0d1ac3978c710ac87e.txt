==========
This cookie lets us identify which users have been randomly selected to take part in a sample to monitor those users’ behaviour on our site.
Hotjar also provides us with a heatmap of the site which allows us to monitor, for example, how far you’ve scrolled down a page and where you may have hovered.
With session and screen recording, we’re able to get more context for complicated problems — by observing users going through our flows in an uninterrupted manner, in their real life setting.
This helps us identify subconscious thought patterns users have, which helps us pin-point where customers might struggle in our product.

We set the _hjClosedSurveyInvites cookie once a visitor interacts with a survey invitation modal popup.
We use it to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.

We set the _hjDoneTestersWidgets cookie once a visitor submits their information in the Recruit User Testers widget.
==========
We use it to ensure that the same form does not reappear if it has already been filled in.
We set the _hjIncludedInSample cookie to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the sample, which lets us generate funnels.
We set the _hjShownFeedbackMessage cookie when a visitor minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback.
We do this so that the form will be minimised immediately if they navigate to another page where it is set to show.
The _hjRecordingLastActivity cookie should be found in sessionStorage (as opposed to cookies).
==========
This gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).
We use the hjTLDTest cookie when the Hotjar script executes and we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname.
==========
We do this so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable).
To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails.
After this check, the cookie is removed.
==========
We use the _hjUserAttributesHash cookie as user attributes are sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.
The _hjCachedUserAttributes cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample.
These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.

We use the iz_sd_ss cookie to store data about a visitor in order to make decisions about when to show a survey, like the number of site visits and survey views.
We ask users to complete a survey from time to time in order to help Wise improve its pages and services.
For example, we might ask users whether they could find the information they were looking for, or ask users what products and services they are interested in.
We use survey responses in order to make content on our site more relevant and helpful to the individual user.
We do not study individuals during this process.

As well as referral source information, it contains a randomly assigned number in order to associate events belonging to the same session, and if logged in, the Wise customer number.

For example, if a user registers on wise.com, the cookie will share with Facebook encrypted emails used to register with Wise in the form of a hash.
If you have an account with Facebook, Facebook will be able to identify you as the same user on Facebook that has registered for Wise.
If you don’t have an account, this hash renders useless, and as such ‘new’ information previously unknown to Facebook is not shared with Facebook.
In this example, we can measure the effectiveness of our Facebook advertising.
It helps us understand how many users have registered with Wise via Facebook.
This is important as it means we can make informed investment decisions about our advertising.
==========
This may help us contribute to our overall mission of reducing prices for customers over time.
This can also help us prevent advertising irrelevant content to users, e.g. advertisements encouraging users to sign up to Wise when they have already done so.
