Erasure Rights (“right to be forgotten” or “right of deletion”, as applicable)
We are legally obligated to comply with a request to delete Personal Data if: the data is no longer needed for the original purpose and no new lawful purpose exists for continued processing; the lawful basis for processing is consent of the data subject and such consent is withdrawn; the data subject exercises his or her right to object to our processing of his or her Personal Data, and we have no overriding grounds for processing the data; the Personal Data is processed unlawfully; or the erasure of the Personal Data is necessary to comply with applicable laws.
In addition, if we transferred Personal Data to a third party, a data subject also has a right to oblige us to tell those third parties that the information should be erased.
The right to erasure is not absolute.
==========
Even if a data subject falls into one of the categories described above, we are entitled to reject the data subject’s request and continue processing data if such processing is (depending on the relevant law that applies to you): necessary to comply with legal or regulatory obligations; necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; is necessary for scientific research etc.; necessary to perform a contract between you and us; necessary to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity; necessary to debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; or solely for our internal use that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on our relationship with you (under the LGPD your Personal Data will have to be anonymized if used for this purpose) – all subject to applicable laws.
Right to Object
With regards to Personal Data processed by us under the lawful basis of our legitimate interests (such as direct marketing), you may object to our processing on such grounds.
However, even if we receive your objection, we will be permitted to continue processing the Personal Data in the event that (subject to applicable laws and regulations):
(i) our legitimate interests for processing override your rights, interests and freedoms.
(ii) the processing of such Personal Data is necessary to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim or right, etc.
The Right of Restriction
A data subject may limit the purposes for which we may process his/her Personal Data.
==========
Our processing activities may be restricted if: the accuracy of the data is contested; processing is unlawful and data subject requests restriction instead of erasure; we no longer need the data for its original purpose, but the data is still required to establish, exercise or defend legal rights; or consideration of overriding grounds in the context of an erasure request.
Data Portability
You may request us to send or “port” your Personal Data that is held by us to a third-party entity, however note, the GDPR, the LGPD and the CCPA apply differently to this right, thus, we will handle this according to your relevant jurisdiction.
Do Not Sell

You also have the right to request the data not to be sold.
