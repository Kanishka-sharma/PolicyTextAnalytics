If you do not use your account on a regular basis, your e-mail will be stored for the year of your subscription, then if you do not continue your subscription, and your account is not used on a regular basis, the contents of your account may be deleted.
==========
If you choose to cancel the MSN Extra Storage Service, then on the expiration date of the one year anniversary of your acceptance of this Agreement, your MSN Groups storage quota will revert to the default storage quota for MSN Groups.
If you have exceeded your quota and you attempt to upload additional files, you will be prompted to first delete files to reduce your quota below the limit.
If you choose to cancel your account (or if your account is canceled because you have not paid the annual charge), you will be required to delete your files to ensure you are now within the default storage quota for MSN Groups.
If after 30 days of cancellation, you have not yet deleted your own files, MSN will delete any files that take your storage over the default limit, starting with the oldest files first.
Any files that are deleted are not retrievable by Microsoft at any time.
Any of your files associated with MSN Groups that are deleted due to inactivity will automatically reduce your quota.
The MSN Extra Storage Service does not prevent any MSN Groups from being deactivated due to inactivity.

You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.
Charges on your Billing Account will be summarized for you online (your "Online Statement").
You will have one Online Statement per Billing Account.
==========
Microsoft reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE PRODUCTS ORDERED.
YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY MICROSOFT IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.
CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT HTTPS://BILLING.MICROSOFT.COM.
==========
IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE MICROSOFT ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT MICROSOFT MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY PRODUCT PROVIDED UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR SUCH PRODUCT (CONFIRMED IN WRITING UPON REQUEST).
Currency exchange settlements will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method (the "Payment Method Provider").
If Microsoft does not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.
Prices for all Products exclude all applicable taxes and telecommunication charges, unless expressly stated otherwise.
.
==========
To the extent permissible by law, you agree to be responsible for any applicable taxes and telecommunication charges, whether or not such amounts are itemized on your Online Statement or charged to your Billing Account or Payment Method.
If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized, you have the right to receive, and Microsoft shall so provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the transaction.
Any agreement you have with the Payment Method Provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.
You agree that Microsoft may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
==========
MICROSOFT MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (CONFIRMED IN WRITING UPON REQUEST) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.
SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE MICROSOFT REASONABLY COULD ACT.
TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO HTTPS://BILLING.MICROSOFT.COM.
==========
Your non-termination or continued use of the Products on your Billing Account reaffirms that Microsoft is authorized to charge your Payment Method.
Microsoft may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.
Those submissions will not waive Microsoft's right to seek payment directly from you.
==========
Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially ordered the applicable Product.
Refund Policies
Subject to any withdrawal right you may have under applicable law, charges are non-refundable unless the price plan terms expressly say otherwise.
Except as otherwise required by law, the costs of any returns if permitted will be at your expense.

Paper copies of your Online Statement will only be provided for 120 days from the date of the Online Statement.
==========
Microsoft will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any technical failures relating to an Online Statement within a reasonable time; however, your inability to view an Online Statement does not extend, or relieve you of, your obligation to pay any amounts owing to Microsoft.
Unless you notify Microsoft of any error within 120 days after it first appears in any Online Statement, such statement will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes, including resolution of inquiries made by your Payment Method Provider.
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YOU RELEASE MICROSOFT FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY AND CLAIMS OF LOSS RESULTING FROM ANY ERROR THAT IS NOT REPORTED TO MICROSOFT WITHIN 120 DAYS AFTER THE ERROR FIRST APPEARS ON YOUR ONLINE STATEMENT.
==========
Due Date: Late Charge; Collection Costs
The amount due to Microsoft for your Billing Account must be paid in full by your Payment Method Provider on the date such payment is requested by Microsoft, not later than 30 days after the billing date; you are not entitled to carry forward a balance.
You agree to pay late charges that may be assessed by Microsoft on amounts due but not timely paid.
The late charge will be 1% per month (or 12% per annum) on the total amount due but not paid; but if such rate is in excess of any allowable rate under applicable laws, then you will instead be charged the maximum rate that is permitted by law.
Microsoft reserves the right to refer your Billing Account to a third party for collection in the event of default.
You agree to pay all costs incurred in the enforcement of this Agreement and in collection of any delinquent amounts due, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
==========
Default
If Microsoft does not receive payment for any charge to your Billing Account, you will be in default and Microsoft may suspend or cancel your Billing Account and your access to any or all Microsoft Products.
If your Payment Method Provider seeks return of payments previously made to Microsoft, but Microsoft in good faith believes that you are liable for the charge and applicable law allows the Payment Method Provider to seek payment from you, you will also be in default and Microsoft may cancel your Billing Account and your access to any or all Products.
CANCELLATION OR SUSPENSION FOR DEFAULT MAY BE MADE WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO YOU AND UPON SUCH CANCELLATION OR SUSPENSION, MICROSOFT MAY STOP DELIVERY OF ANY PRODUCT, AND ANY INFORMATION YOU HAVE STORED ON A MICROSOFT SERVICE MAY NOT BE RETRIEVED AT A LATER DATE.
==========
Termination, Cancellation or Suspension
Microsoft may, in its discretion, terminate, cancel, or suspend an accepted order if Microsoft is notified that your Payment Method has expired or has been canceled, or if Microsoft has reason to believe that any Billing Account information provided to Microsoft is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete.
Termination, cancellation or suspension, whether by you or Microsoft, will not alter your obligation to pay all charges made to your Billing Account before such termination, cancellation or suspension (including charges made after termination by you but before Microsoft could reasonably act on your termination notice ).
You will not be entitled to any refunds upon termination, cancellation or suspension unless the applicable agreement expressly so provides.
General
