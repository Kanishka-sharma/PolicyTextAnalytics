==========
For the safety of our customers and employees, we may use information we collect to detect and prevent potential or actual claims and prohibited behaviors, such as fraud or attempts to breach our information security.
Information Sharing
In order to serve your requests and needs, we work with trusted third parties that help us run our business.
These companies may process payments, fulfill orders, send email or conduct other activities on our behalf.
==========
We only share the information needed by them to serve the specific purpose for which they are engaged and we do not allow them to use your information for unauthorized purposes.
We share your information with our business divisions and affiliated companies for purposes described in this notice and only for legitimate business purposes.
We will share your information when you specifically permit that sharing.

We may disclose personal information if we are required to by law or legal process or in response to requests by government agencies or as required for national security.
Should Parallels merge with or be acquired by another company or we sell product lines, service activities or other assets, it is likely your information will be transferred as is appropriate and relevant.
We may share aggregated and anonymized information (non-identifying) such as statistics about website visitors, product users or other uses of our products and services.

==========
Information Retention & Destruction
We maintain customer information for as long as we need it to provide the requested services.
When personal information is no longer needed to serve the purpose of its collection, we strive to de-identify the data, creating aggregated, anonymous records to aid our research and to improve our products, services, and communications.
When we do discard personal information, we employ data destruction techniques designed to completely destroy data and prevent any future recovery.
