Walmart.com supports Verified by Visa (VbV), a security technology that authenticates your Visa card and ensures that only the authorized cardholder is placing the order.
If the bank that issued your Visa card supports VbV, you will be prompted to enter your password or to sign up for VbV as you check out.
You can also activate your current card now.
