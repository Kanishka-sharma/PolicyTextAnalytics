Nextdoor Privacy Policy
Welcome to Nextdoor.
We invite you to read about our privacy and security practices and contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
The effective date of this policy is February 4, 2014.
This policy is a part of the Nextdoor member agreement, but it controls over any conflicts with that agreement.
==========
This policy only addresses our practices associated with the Nextdoor.com website and the associated iPhone and Android apps.
Other websites, apps and services we operate may be subject to other policies and practices.
General Practices (also applicable to non-members)
Server Logs.
==========
We automatically collect information about your visits to our website, usage of the service, and your interaction with the messages we send, including the browser you are using, the URLs you came from and go to, your operating system, your IP address, and usage and browsing habits.
We use this information to diagnose and resolve server problems, analyze trends, help target offers and other ads, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.
Cookies.
Like most websites, our website uses "cookies," small data files stored on your computer which include a unique identifier.
These include cookies from us and from our business partners.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.
You can configure your browser to reject cookies, but doing so will prevent you from logging into our website.
Our systems are not configured to accept browsers’ Do Not Track signals.
Web Beacons.
Our website and emails may contain "web beacons" that help us measure and track member activity.
Some of these web beacons come from us; others come from our service providers.
==========
Invitations.
Existing Nextdoor members may invite you to join the service via postal mail, email, SMS/text message or other ways.
To help Nextdoor members extend those invitations, we gather information about neighbors in a neighborhood, including non-members.
If you aren’t a member, you can opt-out of future email invitations, or ask us to delete any non-public information about you that we use to facilitate member invitations, by contacting us.
If we haven't built your neighborhood service yet, you can ask us to notify you when we create a neighborhood where you live.
==========
We retain your request information indefinitely and use it to provide the requested notification and assist with your verification.
If you change your mind about wanting to be notified, contact us.
Signing Up
Verification.
==========
You can verify your neighbor status by:
(1) having a neighbor (who already has an account in the neighborhood) invite you to the neighborhood and then confirming your address, or
(2) providing us your name and street address (and email address, if we don't already have it) and then providing us (or a third party vendor directly) with additional authenticating information that we request, such as a credit card number, the last four digits of your social security number, a unique code we mail to you, or your home or mobile phone number (you’ll need to provide a unique code we communicate to you when we call).
In addition, neighborhood Leads can see unverified neighbors and their addresses and manually verify them.
To further help with neighbor verification, Leads also may be able to see all neighbors’ addresses, regardless of their display settings.
We may inform Leads who has joined the neighborhood.
We may offer other verification methods as well.
==========
If we ask you to confirm your email address and you don’t, we may choose to restrict or terminate your account.
We may share your verification information with third party vendors to help with our verification.
In addition to the information described above, we obtain non-public information from third party vendors to facilitate verification.
We may choose to retain all verification-related information indefinitely to assist with future verifications, even if you do not complete the verification.
If you decide not to verify the account and would like us to delete your non-public verification information, contact us.
==========
To start a neighborhood, we obtain public information about residences in the neighborhood, such as street addresses and property lot maps.
Your neighbors may provide us with, and share with your other neighbors, information about you (even if you are not a member), such as your name, email address, street address, phone numbers and other information typically found in neighborhood directories.
If you aren't a member but would like us to delete non-public information about you, contact us.
==========
Facebook Connect.
If you register for Nextdoor using your Facebook account, we automatically attempt to obtain your account ID, your name, email address and gender as well as information about your Facebook friends.
We use the information to automatically create a Nextdoor account and profile for you (and ask you for a password) so you can log into Nextdoor in the future without connecting through Facebook if you wish.
Or, if you revisit Nextdoor while logged into Facebook, we’ll automatically log you into Nextdoor when you visit our website again.
If you don’t register for Nextdoor using Facebook but later attempt to log into Nextdoor using your Facebook credentials, we’ll connect your Facebook and Nextdoor accounts and attempt to obtain the information from Facebook as if you were newly registering.
Facebook may be able to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites.
==========
If you register or log in via Facebook, we may give you the option to invite your Facebook friends to Nextdoor.
Those friends will see some information about you along with your invitation.
Using the Service
Profile Information.
==========
We allow you to create a personal profile and submit information such as your phone number, photo, occupation, family members, biography and personal interests.
We may give you ways to hide some of this profile information, but your name and street address may be visible to your neighbors so long as you maintain your account.
Irrespective of your subscriptions to nearby neighborhoods, neighbors outside your neighborhood cannot see your personal profile unless you configure your settings otherwise.
If you are the subject of an unauthorized profile, please contact us.
==========
Communications with Other Members.
We give you a variety of ways to communicate with your neighbors and share Content (as defined in the member agreement).
Some of these communications are visible to the entire neighborhood and (if you choose) nearby neighborhoods, although we may give your neighbors ways to block your communications.
Other communications (such as messages between you and another individual member) may be visible only to a subset of your neighbors.
In some cases, we may limit your ability to edit or remove Content from Nextdoor.
You can manage your email preferences on your settings page.
Certain member-related administrative emails cannot be turned off; the only way to end those is to deactivate your account.
==========
Respecting Your Neighbors' Privacy.
One of Nextdoor's central tenets is that neighbors should be able to communicate amongst themselves.
For this reason, we restrict who can access your neighborhood and take efforts to exclude non-neighbors from the conversation.
==========
For example, we don't let public Web search engines (such as Google) index member-submitted Content.
Given this norm, taking information shared by one neighbor to another and sharing it outside the neighborhood(s) violates your neighbors' expectations and is a serious breach of trust.
Therefore, you may not share your neighbors' information or any communications sent through Nextdoor with anyone outside the neighborhood(s) to which the post was distributed without the author's permission.
==========
Also, you may not gather information from Nextdoor, either manually or on an automated basis (such as through scripts, robots, crawlers or spiders).
Without limiting the foregoing, it is not OK to provide your neighbors' information from Nextdoor to third party marketers.
Violating this provision may lead to a loss of account privileges, potentially including a permanent ban from Nextdoor.
==========
Apps.
Our mobile apps obtain and use your geolocation information.
On iPhones and other iOS Products, you will be prompted to approve access by the Nextdoor iPhone app to your location within the app itself.
On Android phones, you will be prompted to approve all permissions, including access by the Nextdoor Android app to your location before you download the app.
Currently, we use your location information to display your location to you on your neighborhood map.
In the future, we may use your location information to allow you to tag your posts, photos and events, and display activities and content that may be relevant to your current location.
Through your app, you may also choose to post photos and invite the friends in your address book to Nextdoor.
==========
Third Party Offers.
We know that you do not want marketing from third parties just because you join a neighborhood website, so we do not turn over your personally identifiable information to third party marketers without your express consent.
In the future, we may create a feature that presents offers for goods and services we think you'd like.
==========
If you decide to participate with an offer, you may be presented with an opportunity to share information with the merchant.
If you accept the offer, then we'll send the information you requested to share with the merchant.
We won't transmit that information to the merchant until you explicitly ask us to do so.
At that point, the data we deliver to the merchant will be governed by the merchant's privacy policy, not ours.
==========
Moving Neighborhoods.
If you move your account from one neighborhood to another, you will need to verify your address in the new neighborhood, and some of your personal profile (such as name, photo, interests, responses to your invitations, phone and email contact) will migrate to the new neighborhood.
You will no longer be a member of the old neighborhood.
You won’t appear on that neighborhood’s directory or map, receive notifications from the old neighborhood, or be able to access the content in the old neighborhood (although, if you move to a nearby neighborhood, you may be able to access posts from the old neighborhood accessible to nearby neighbors).
Your previously posted Content will remain in the old neighborhood, attributed to you, unless you delete individual Content items before moving; and remaining Content items will link to a limited user profile that includes your name.
We may notify the neighborhood Leads of your move and give you an opportunity to explain your move to the Leads.
==========
Account Deactivation and Reactivation.
You can deactivate your account through your account settings.
Deactivation will end your email notifications, and you will no longer appear in your neighborhood directory or map.
Your previously posted Content will remain in your neighborhood, attributed to you, unless you delete individual Content items before you deactivate; and remaining Content items will link to a limited user profile that includes your name.
You can undo an account deactivation by reactivating your account (though we may set a time limit for reactivation).
We may notify the neighborhood Leads of your departure from the neighborhood and give you an opportunity to explain it to the Leads.
==========
Other Provisions (applicable to both members and non-members)
Contractors/Service Providers.
Third party contractors may have access to our databases.
These contractors sign a standard confidentiality agreement.
==========
Some of Nextdoor’s functionality may be operated by third party service providers, and in the course of providing this functionality, these service providers may have access to some of your personal data to facilitate your usage of this service.
We may allow third parties to place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data (including, possibly, personally identifiable information) from your visits to this and other websites to provide us with analytics services and to serve ads to you.
Our "Corporate Family."
We may share your data with any parent company, subsidiaries, other entities under a common control or third party acquirers.
We expect these other entities will honor this policy.
Also, we may allow a potential acquirer or merger partner to review our data, although we would restrict their use and disclosure of this data during the diligence phase.
==========
Government Relations and Lawsuits.
We may disclose data about you to the government if we are required to do so or as we think is prudent for safety or security reasons; and you authorize us to make these disclosures.
We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential legal proceedings (a) in response to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders, (b) if we are required to do so in other ways, (c) if such disclosures might mitigate our liability, or (d) to enforce our rights.
Posts by government entity accounts, and your replies to them, may be subject to laws mandating public access to government records (such as the Freedom of Information Act/FOIA or state "sunshine" laws).
==========
Limits on Our Abilities.
While we work hard to respect your privacy, like any other complex online service, we might inadvertently use or disclose your data in ways inconsistent with this policy.
For example, a temporary software glitch could lead to public display of your personal data despite your contrary preferences.
We might also make ad hoc uses of your data in ways not mentioned here.
In these anomalous situations, we will try to rectify the anomaly as soon as we can.
Data Retention.
Subject to any legal obligations to delete data, we may choose to retain information in our server logs, our databases and our records indefinitely.
==========
Security.
Nextdoor uses https on its web pages to reduce the risk of unauthorized interception of your communications during your visits to the website.
However, we cannot guarantee that your personal data won’t be intercepted or improperly accessed.
==========
Amendment.
This privacy policy is part of the Nextdoor member agreement and can be modified in accordance with the amendment procedures described in that document.
