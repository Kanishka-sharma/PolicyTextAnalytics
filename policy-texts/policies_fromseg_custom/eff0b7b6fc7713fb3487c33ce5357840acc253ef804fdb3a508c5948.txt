Web Beacons

Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.
Web beacons are typically 1-by-1 pixel files, but their presence can usually be seen within the Internet Explorer browser by clicking on "View" and then on "Source" on the Internet Explorer menu.
We include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read.
