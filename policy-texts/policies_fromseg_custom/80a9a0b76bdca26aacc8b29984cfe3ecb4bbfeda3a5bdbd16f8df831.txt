If you request it, on payment of a fee, which is currently Â£10, we will provide you with a copy of the personal information to which you are entitled that we hold about you.
The information we hold about you is confidential.
We will only disclose it outside the Carphone Warehouse Group when:

you give us your consent,
it is needed by certain reputable third parties involved in running accounts and/or providing services for you (for example, credit reference agencies who do credit checks for us),
in order to obtain professional advice,
we or others need to investigate or prevent crime (e.g. to fraud prevention agencies),
the law permits or requires it, or any regulatory or governmental body requests or requires it, even without your consent, or,
there is a duty to the public to reveal the information.
We may administer your account and provide other services from centres in countries outside Europe that do not always have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK.
However, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act even when your personal information is processed outside Europe.
