											to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has

Identification of works or materials being infringed;

									was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or 
									the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to 
									post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright 
									owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or
