Information Collected On All Site Visitors
We gather certain generic information with respect to visitors' use of the Site such as the number of visitors, the frequency with which they visit and the areas on the Site that they favor, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program.
==========
We only use this type of data in aggregate-that is, we look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis.
This collective data helps us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of the Site, which, in turn, enables us to make the Site as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.
We also may provide aggregate statistical "ratings" to our AmericanGreetings.com Partners about how our customers, collectively, use the Site.
We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of our Site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well.
These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our users.

Paid subscribers are required to provide the foregoing information as well as certain credit card information and the corresponding billing address.
Our registration process also allows you to provide us with permission to send you our email newsletter as well as other promotional emails from AmericanGreetings.com or our sponsors and partners.
