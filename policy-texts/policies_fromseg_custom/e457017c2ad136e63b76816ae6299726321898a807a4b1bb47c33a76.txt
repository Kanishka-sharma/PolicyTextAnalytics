If you are located outside of the United States, please note that this Site is hosted on our computer servers in the United States.
Any personal information collected through this Site may be transferred to the United States and other countries that might not provide an equivalent level of protection as the data protection laws in your home country.
Your use of this Site or submission of any personal information will therefore constitute your consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of your home country.
Starbucks may collect personal information.
Personal information means information about an identifiable individual and may include: 



identifying information, such as name, address, e-mail address;



financial information, such as credit card number; and



employment-related information, such as may be found on resumes, applications, background verification information, or in employment references.
Personal information does not include business contact information (e.g. office address, telephone number) in those jurisdictions that recognize such information as not being personal information.
We may receive personal information from the website of any Starbucks brand, including Tazo® Tea, Hear Music or EthosTM water.
Personal information will be collected, to the extent possible, directly from the individual concerned.
In addition to the personal information you actively provide us, we also collect web site use information which includes information about your internet service provider, browser type, domain name, IP address, the web site that referred you to us, the web pages you request, the date and time of those requests, and entry and exit points.
Our collection of web site use information may involve the use of cookies and pixel tags.
Starbucks may also collect aggregated data, which is data from which the identity of an individual cannot be determined.
Since it is not personal information, Starbucks may use aggregated data in any way that it considers appropriate.
==========
Starbucks may use personal information provided verbally or in writing (including via electronic media) by customers and potential employees in order to: 



Process and manage your purchase of Starbucks products and services, including the purchase and use of your Starbucks Card;

Communicate, to the extent required, with and manage our relationship with Starbucks consultants, strategic partners, agents, distributors, suppliers, contractors and other companies affiliated with Starbucks in order to improve Starbucks offering of products and services; and

We may arrange to have marketing and promotional information of other companies sent to you that we think might be of interest to you only if you tell us that you would like to receive these sorts of materials in your communication preferences.
Our website may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as credit card processors, mailing houses or web hosts) or that help us market our products and services (such as email vendors).
==========
These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions.
These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.
We may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our corporate policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety.
We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

In the event of a sale of some or all of our business, Starbucks may disclose personal information to those involved in a transfer of all or part of the assets or business.
Also, if you participate in any blog or other online forum, any personal information that you post on the website may be shared with other participants in the forum.
In any of these situations, the recipient of the personal information may be located in the United States or another jurisdiction that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home country.
Unless permitted by law, no personal information is collected, without first obtaining your consent for the collection, use and sharing of that information.
The provision of personal information to Starbucks means that you agree and consent that we may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.
In addition, where appropriate, specific authorizations or consents may be obtained from time to time.
For example, we may seek consent to use and share personal information after it has been collected in those cases where Starbucks wishes to use the information for a purpose not previously identified or for which the individual concerned has not previously provided consent.
In most cases, and subject to legal and contractual restrictions, an individual is free to refuse or withdraw his or her consent at any time upon reasonable, advance notice.
==========
It should be noted that in some circumstances, certain Starbucks products and services can only be offered if a person provides personal information to Starbucks.
If you choose not provide us with any required personal information, we may not be able to offer the products or services requested.
We will inform you of the consequences of the withdrawal of consent.
