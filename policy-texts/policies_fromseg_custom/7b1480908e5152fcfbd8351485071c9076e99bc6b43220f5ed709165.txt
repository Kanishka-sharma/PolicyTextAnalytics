Privacy policy

                This is the privacy policy for Rippll Ltd and all associated campaign landing pages linking to our cashback program.
Rippll take your data privacy very seriously, we intend to be as transparent as possible about our data processes, what data we use and how we store it.
What data does Rippll collect?
Rippll collect both anonymous and identifiable consumer information for market research in the following ways:
                 
                (1) If you click on an ad by Rippll and declare your age and recent purchases in order to see if you qualify for cashback
                we store this data anonymously and it is not possible to link back to your personally identifiable information in any way.
(2) If you then qualify for cashback and choose to share your purchase history with us via open banking in exchange for cashback (effectively selling that data to us)
                we will then store your personal information for as long as we need to process your cashback and comply with all anti-money laundering laws under our 'legitimate interest' to that data.
We will also anonymise your purchase data and use that for market research

                such that none of your shopping data can be linked back to your personal information.
How is the data used?
==========
Rippll use the purchase data collected from consumers to help advertisers understand if the advertising they have been served has affected
                their purchasing behaviour.
We are able to do this because it is the same advertisers that served the Rippll ad which started your interaction with our website.
==========
Hence we do not directly link our data to theirs.
We also help market research agencies collect data from consumers to analyse shopping trends.
What data is shared with other companies?
We only share insights about consumers trends with other companies and never share your personal data or any identifiers than could help them enrich their data with new information about you.
However from time to time companies may use Rippll services to collect data for their own databases and in such a case the name of this company collecting the data will be given when you choose to share the data.
