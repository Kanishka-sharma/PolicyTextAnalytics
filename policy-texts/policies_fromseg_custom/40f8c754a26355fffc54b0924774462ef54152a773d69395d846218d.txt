This analytical cookie monitors your behaviour on our Website, such as the duration of and which pages you visit.

Advertational cookies are tracking cookies placed by the advertisers in our widgets on your computer.
They use these cookies to monitor which pages you visit and to create a profile of your online behaviour.
This profile is partly based on comparable information which they gather from your visits to other websites on which they advertise.
This profile will not be matched on your name, address, e-mail, etc., as known by us, but only to tune our advertisements as much as possible to your profile, so these advertisements are relevant for you.
