The BlueKai Registry helps increase transparency by showing you what types of interest data are collected by Oracle's BlueKai services for use in interest-based advertising.
For more information about Oracle BlueKai services, including information on how to opt‐out.
The BlueKai Registry shows third-party interest data that is applicable to the computer viewing the registry.
Within the BlueKai Registry, you may remove individual interest segments at your sole discretion.
Keep in mind that the interest data you see within the registry is information from the profile associated with the specific browser, computer or device that you are visiting it with.
Unless Oracle has linked browsers, computers or devices into a common profile (as described in the "Cross-Device/Cross-Context Technology" section of the Oracle Marketing Cloud & Oracle Data Cloud Privacy Policy), you may see different segments when viewing the registry from a different browser, computer or device.
Below are the applicable interest segments associated with your computer and web-browser.
You can click the “X” next to each to remove it, at your discretion.
Please note that interest data is noted based on collective activities from your computer and browser.
If your computer is shared, this may reflect interests from other members of your household.
