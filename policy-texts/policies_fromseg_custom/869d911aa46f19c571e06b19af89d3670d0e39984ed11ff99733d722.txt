The American Psychological Association (APA) is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and values your privacy and recognizes the sensitivity of your personal information.
Our employees share the same concerns.
Together, we work towards protecting your privacy.
We have carefully crafted our Privacy Policy to address any concerns you might have, and to assure you that your personal information, if provided to us, will be treated carefully and appropriately.
Basic Confidentiality Policy

The personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by appropriate staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information, such as to reply to your request or to send you requested materials.

Note that the membership roster is a benefit of membership.
Use of the roster is subject to specific rules, see terms of use.
The roster's information is based on that information which members have indicated is publishable and it is available to other members in the members-only section.
==========
If you also indicate on our site that you would like to receive announcements and notices from the APA, your personal information will be added to the appropriate APA mailing list.
If at any time you change your mind and would like to add or remove your name from the APA's mailing list, or correct your personal information, please e-mail us at Webmaster.
No Release of Information to Third Parties
Personal information collected as a function of this Web site will not be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which you provide the information or if such release is required by law.
==========
Note, the membership roster is available to members and affiliates of APA in the members-only section.
See roster use-specific rules in the terms of use.
The roster is compiled from information provided by members for reference uses such as searching for and contacting colleagues or for making referrals, etc.
Collection and Use of Information
The APA site requires you to provide certain personally identifiable information in order to use certain "Members Only" features and functions of the site.
By providing such information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Policy.
The information you provide may include information provided during the registration process, including contact information, (such as your name, address and e-mail address) and financial information, such as a credit card number, if you order products or services through the site.

This information will be used to process your order and if necessary, to contact you regarding the status of your order.
You agree and acknowledge that your order may be processed, fulfilled or serviced by third parties other than APA and you understand that such third parties are not limited by APA in their use of the information provided to them to process, fulfill or service your order.
Therefore, in order to process, fulfill or service your order, you expressly consent to our sharing your information with any necessary third parties.

APA may use your contact information to get in touch with you regarding the status of your membership, registration or any orders you may place, for instance.
You may also be contacted by us or our agents regarding additional services and features, or we may request your feedback about your experience with APA.

No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information
Our Web site does not track, collect or distribute personal information about visitors.
We regularly compile aggregate statistics that show the number of visitors to our site, the requests we receive for particular information on our web site, and the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that those requests come from.
These aggregated statistics are used by internal APA technical support staff to improve the Web site in an ongoing effort to provide better information and services to the public.
Cookies
Like most Web sites, the APA site uses "cookies" to allow you to move more quickly through the APA site.
We use this information only for purposes of planning and tracking, as well as assisting the technical function of our site.
By understanding how our site is accessed, we can continually improve it to respond to user's interests.
==========
However, APA cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or third parties hosting data for APA.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature.
Please note that cookies may be necessary to enable you to use certain features on the APA site.
Third Party Web sites
The APA Web site may provide you with links to the Web sites of third parties, although we do not necessarily advise that you are linking to another Web site.
In the event you choose to access such Web sites, the APA is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
Further, please note that the third party's privacy policy and security practices may differ from APA standards.
APA assumes no responsibility nor does it control, endorse or guarantee any aspect of your use of the linked site.
We recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of such party before providing personally identifiable information to it, as its privacy policy may differ from the APA's.
Changes in our Privacy Policy
Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of our policies.
We may also contact you by e-mail with any changes.
APA utilizes Web site security measures, consistent with current information practices, to protect its Web site, e-mail, and mailing list servers.
==========
These measures include technical, procedural, monitoring and tracking steps intended to protect data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction.
Credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.
Member and purchaser information security is a high priority and we utilize our own protective measures as well as the capabilities of our software and hardware vendors.
We realize that there can be incidents of misuse and unauthorized program incursions - as most every Web site, service, and user encounters.
In those instances our goals are to move quickly to isolate the problem, ensure or restore proper functionality, and minimize any inconvenience to our users.
==========
Please report problems to the Webmaster.
While we may not be able to respond to each and every report, each report is taken seriously and each report will be investigated thoroughly.
We appreciate your patience, understanding, and confidence in our intention to provide high levels of security and integrity in our Web site and all APA electronic resources.
