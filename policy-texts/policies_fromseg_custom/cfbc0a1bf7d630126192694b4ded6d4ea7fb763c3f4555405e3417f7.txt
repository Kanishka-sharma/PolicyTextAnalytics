Seagate Technology Privacy Policy
  
Seagate Technology LLC and our affiliates ("Seagate", "we", "us", "our") respect your right to privacy and we have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected through this website ("Site") and through the use of our products and/or services (collectively "Offerings"), how such information may be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and control its use.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by using this Site and/or our Offerings, you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
When you visit this Site, our third party service provider websites, and/or use our Offerings, we may collect certain types of information from you, including personally identifiable information (“PII”), including information that you, your computer, or your devices (including mobile devices) voluntarily provide via forms, surveys, applications and through the use of various Offerings or participation in various Seagate programs or services.
We may also collect information about you from your online browsing and transactions, including your preferences, pages visited, technical information regarding your computer, devices and operating systems.
Information You Provide
In certain circumstances, you may be asked to provide some specific information about yourself in order to use certain features on this Site and/or the Offerings or to take advantage of certain opportunities that we may offer through this Site and/or the Offerings.
==========
For example, we may collect personal contact, billing, and credit information when you register, sign up for, or purchase our Offerings.
Please note that the Seagate online store may be administered by a third party E-commerce service provider who may collect payment or credit card information and the online store privacy policy may differ from this Privacy Policy but the relevant privacy policy will be posted as a link on the online store.
We may also collect PII in connection with the return of products, warranty and product registration, when you call, participate in community discussions, chat or e-mail our customer service representatives, enter information on our Site, submit survey responses, participate in promotions, sweepstakes or contests or for the purposes of receiving information about our Offerings and promotions.
The foregoing is more fully described below.
Information Collected
We and our authorized third party service providers collect certain information, some of which may be associated with PII, whenever you use our Offerings or Site.
==========
For example, when your computer web browser or other communication device (including phone, PDA, etc.) accesses our Site, we automatically receive certain information, such as your device ID or unique identifier, device type, unique device token, referring domains, language, IP address, browser type, date and time, and the web page you visited before visiting our Site.
This statistical data provides us with information about the use of this Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on this Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on.
We collect this information through the use of technologies such as "cookies", “web beacons” and "IP addresses", which are discussed in greater detail below.
==========
In some cases, we may provide the original shipped-to customer information for warranty inquiries by third parties, in order to provide service support to customers.
We collect information in order to determine which areas of this Site are most popular and to enhance this Site for visitors.
From time to time we may also collect general, statistical information about information and data stored and shared through the "Network Attached Storage" features of our Offerings and the Offerings we provide to support "Network Attached Storage" features ("Web Service").
==========
We also may collect aggregate metadata concerning your files.
We will use this aggregate data to provide you with our Offerings, improve our Offerings and improve our general marketing efforts related to the Offerings.
We may group this information into aggregate data in order to describe the use of this Site and/or our Offerings to our existing and/or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request.
However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other individuals.
==========
IP Addresses
An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when it accesses the Internet or another computer network.
Web servers and network devices automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to track the use of this Site.
When visitors request pages from this Site, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses.
It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.
However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with this Site's policies or to protect our services, members, this Site, or others.
==========
Cookies
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a device accessing the Internet.
We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our Site or the pages we use to deliver our Offerings to you.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your device for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
==========
You can learn more about cookies at allaboutcookies.org.
On our Site, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site by saving your preferences and to improve and track the overall Site experience.
For our Site, we set a persistent cookie to determine your language and country so we can provide you with relevant content.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited.
Please see the Section "Advertising" to learn more about cookies placed on this Site and third party websites.
Cookies and similar files do not contain or capture unencrypted personally identifiable data.
For many cookies, you may disable our placement of cookies on your device.
==========
Web Beacons
Web beacons are small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that may be included on our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.
Web beacons tell our advertising service providers the Internet address of the Site pages viewed by users, browsing patterns within the Site, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the Site.
Cloud-based or back-up data
If you use a Seagate cloud-based or back-up service, the information from your device and/or account that you choose to backup such as your contacts, email addresses, calendar, memo, tasks, display pictures, status messages, media files and other on- device information may be sent to Seagate or Seagate service providers.
Seagate or Seagate service providers may store this information for you and may use this information in order to facilitate or improve the use, remote access and restoration of that data on your device through the Offerings provided.
==========
Use of Information
Any information you submit on this Site and/or through our Offerings will be used for a variety of business purposes, including for example, to complete transactions and bill for Offerings; provide you with our Offerings; verify your identity; respond to your requests for service or assistance; anticipate and resolve actual and potential problems with our Offerings; create and improve Offerings; contact you, either via email, telephone or otherwise as authorized by you to answer questions, resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems with your account, product or our Services; suggest additional or different Offerings; make internal business decisions about current and future offers; provide personalized service and user experiences; protect our rights and property; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities and as otherwise disclosed at the point where such information is collected or in any additional terms and conditions applicable to the particular feature of this Site and/or the Offerings.
Information Sharing
In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through this Site, to respond to your inquiries, and/or to provide our Offerings to you or enable a third party service provider to provide Offerings to you, we may share your PII with third parties.
Such third parties are companies or individuals that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that analyze data, provide customer service or other Offerings, advertisers, sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance (but such information will be shared only to the extent they need such information to perform their functions).
==========
These service providers may use these technologies to help us deliver our own content and advertising, and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics.
We do not permit any of these service providers to collect any of your personal information on our sites or in our services, applications, or tools for their own purposes.
These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions on their use or collection of any personal information.
==========
Your PII may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties to provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.
We may use third parties, such as advertising networks and exchanges, to allow us to serve you advertisements.
These third-party ad networks and exchange providers may use third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information.
They may also collect your device identifier, IP address, or identifier for advertising (IDFA).
The information that these third parties collect may be used to assist us in providing you with more relevant advertising that we serve on our sites or elsewhere on the web.
For more information on third-party advertising-related cookies and how to opt-out of them, please visit one of the following third party websites:

Some of the aggregate or PII that Seagate receives is collected through third party service offerings that are available through our Offerings.
==========
In these cases the third party service provider will require you to sign up for the applicable service offering and will include a link to the relevant privacy policy that applies to such collection (i.e. this Seagate Privacy Policy or the third party's privacy policy).
We may allow you to share information with third party social media sites, or use social media sites or other sites to create or connect to your account.
Those social media sites may give us access to certain personal information stored by them (e.g., content viewed and information about the advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with the online services.
Remember that you control the personal information you allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on that third party site and the permissions you give us when you grant us access.
We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served on us; (c) to protect or defend our legal rights or property, this Site or our Offerings, or its users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of this Site's users or the general public.
Except as provided herein, your personally identifiable information will not be provided to any third parties without prior approval from you.
==========
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.
If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to this Site and/or the Offerings, personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of this Site and/or our Offerings will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets.
Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.
Choice and Access
You may always direct us not to share your PII with third parties, not to use your PII to provide you with information or offers, or not to send you newsletters, e-mails or other communications by: (i) sending us an e-mail at webmaster@seagate.com; (ii) contacting us by mail at Seagate Technology LLC, 10200 South De Anza Boulevard, Cupertino, California 95014, Attention: Webmaster; or (iii) following the removal instructions in the communication that you receive.
==========
Your opt-out request will be processed within 30 business days of the date on which we receive it.
In addition to your normal access to your web account information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personally identifiable information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.
==========
Advertising
Seagate advertises on pages within the Site as well as on other websites not affiliated with Seagate.
We contract with advertising service providers who serve advertising to you through the use of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons.
Behavioral Information/Targeted Marketing
We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you while you are on the Site.
==========
These advertising service providers may use anonymous behavioral information, such as how you navigate the Site, to provide relevant advertisements to you while you are on the Site.
These advertising service providers do not have access to or collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, account number or telephone number.
If you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site, as described above.
Advertising on Other Websites
Seagate contracts with advertising companies to advertise our accounts and Offerings on websites not affiliated with Seagate.
If you click on one of our ads, you link to the third party website that offers the advertised account or Offerings.
These ads may contain cookies that allow tracking of your response to our advertisements.
These cookies do not identify you personally.
==========
Seagate's advertising service providers, such as Google, Yahoo!, or MSN/Microsoft, may offer a way to opt-out of targeted advertising based on the use of their cookies.
In addition, if you prefer that our advertising service providers not know which Seagate website pages you have viewed visit the Network Advertising Initiative site: http://www.networkadvertising.org to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies.
In order for the opt-outs to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies.
==========
If you delete cookies, buy a new computer, access the Site from a different computer, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again.
If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as behavioral marketing technology does not work when scripting is disabled.
Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.
Alternatively, if you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site.
==========
Children Under 13
This Site and our Offerings are not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.
If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
==========
Keeping Your Information Secure
We have reasonable security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.
If you have registered on this Site, for our Offerings or are a member of the Seagate Partner Program, access to your account will be protected by your password.
We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.
==========
Additional Information Regarding Network Attached Storage
Our "Network Attached Storage" feature enables you to share files from your storage device over the Internet only with people you authorize.
Authorized users have access only to those files you specifically designate.
Although the "Network Attached Storage" feature is designed so that no one can access your files over the Internet without your permission, Seagate cannot guarantee or warrant that others will not be able to access your files.
==========
You connect with our servers during sign-in.
After you have successfully signed in, you can view and download files that you have enabled for web access or that have been shared with you by others.
We give you the option of creating private, password-protected folders and files on your storage device.
Except as stated below, your files are stored only on your storage device, not on our servers.
==========
The "Network Attached Storage" feature is designed so that only you and the people with whom you choose to share your files should be able to see your data.
Keep in mind that any files or pictures you share using the storage device can be saved and forwarded by the people with whom you share them.
We may store the file directory of your storage device on our servers.
==========
You use this directory to navigate and select the files you want to view or download when you are away from your storage device.
When you download a file from the Web Service, you are pulling the file directly from your storage device, not from our servers.
We may also store some directory names (but not file names) in our secure data center in order to provide persistent share information and descriptions to your recipients.
The storage device service automatically times out signed-in users after a period of inactivity.
==========
If we suspect that your account has been compromised or is being used suspiciously, we will deactivate the account and notify you.
Notify us immediately by sending an e-mail to webmaster@seagate.com if you think your account has been compromised.
All data transmissions between your storage device and your authorized web users are protected by 128-bit SSL encryption.
Our service hardware is housed in a secure, access-controlled data center where each access is logged.
Only authorized employees with a need for access are granted access.
==========
Other Sites and Third Party Offerings
This Site may contain links to other websites that we do not control or maintain.
We encourage you to note when you leave this Site and to read the privacy statements of such other websites before submitting any personally identifiable information.
Additionally, if you access a third party branded service through an API or otherwise, you are solely responsible for understanding, agreeing to and complying with the third party service terms and conditions of use and privacy policy.
Seagate is not responsible for the privacy policies or security of third party websites and/or services.
==========
International Processing and Transfer of Data
Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission and processing of data on an international basis (including in and to the United States and countries other than the country where the data was collected from you, which may not have data protection laws as stringent as those that exist in your country of residence).
By using this Site and/or the Offerings, or providing personally identifiable information to Seagate you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories outside of the country where the data was collected from you.

Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature and/or as required by law or regulatory change, Seagate may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If so, Seagate will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site along with a change notice on the Site.
Seagate may also send registered users of our Offerings a notice that this Privacy Policy has been changed.
Seagate encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
Your continued use of this Site and/or our Offerings and/or your continued provision of personally identifiable information to us after the posting of such notice will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.
