If you come in contact with our technology as an end user
Tracking technology of Ingenious Partner Management Platform | User of cookies
Under their contract with us, our customers use the tracking technology we have developed to create the connection between a click by you on an advertisement, (or the display of an advertisement (touch point) in your web browser) and an action by you (e.g. a purchase in the online shop or signing up to receive a newsletter).
At every touch point, your browser sends an HTTP request to Ingenious server which transmits specific information.
==========
This information includes the URL of the website where the advertising is placed (referrer URL), the browser identification (user agent) of your end device (including data on the type of device and the operating system), the IP address of the end device (this IP address is anonymised by us prior to storage), HTTP header (data package with various technical data automatically transmitted by your browser), the time of the request and, if already stored on the end device, the cookie and its entire contents.
A cookie is a small piece of data exchanged between your browser and the server.
==========
In it, information relevant to the web application, e.g. the contents of a virtual shopping basket, can be stored and transmitted.
The tracking technology stores cookies on your end device in order to document actions.
In the cookie, information on the most recent touch points is stored (i.e. when a specific piece of advertising was displayed or clicked on an end device).
==========
A cookie ID created by us is also stored in the cookie.
Data on the touch points that have occurred and information on your actions are stored with this cookie ID.
The touch points stored can, where appropriate, be assembled to form a user journey.
If there is an action-request, the order number and the shopping basket value of your order are usually also transmitted and stored by us.
==========
In addition, the following data may be transmitted and saved: your customer ID, new customer attribute, your age and gender and the information you have provided in a customer survey.
The information transmitted to us and the cookies serve the sole purpose of properly assessing the success of an advertisement and the corresponding invoice.
This purpose is justified on the ground of our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR.
==========
If you do not want cookies to be stored in your browser, you can prevent this by changing the corresponding browser settings.
Under extras/internet options, you can deactivate the storing of cookies, restrict it to certain websites, or set your browser in such a way that it informs you every time a cookie is sent.
However, you must be aware that in this case you will have to expect a limited presentation of the online services and limited user guidance.
==========
You can also delete cookies at any time.
In this case, the information deposited there will be removed from your end device.
==========
The collecting and processing of tracking data can also be deactivated by clicking on this tracking opt-out link:
https://<Tracking-Domain>/ts/<Advertiser-ID>/tsv?settrackingoptout
When there is a click on the tracking opt-out link, a special cookie is written that deactivates tracking in the web browser currently in use on the end device.
However, tracking will be reactivated if you delete the tracking opt-out cookie.
The following outline informs you which specific cookies are used by our tracking technology:
a. Domain: <Tracking domain of the customer>
Cookie Name: tsv
Purpose: This cookie is written when an advertisement is displayed.
This cookie contains a cookie ID and a list with information on the most recent view touch points, consisting of time, referrer URL and Admedia code (unique identification of the advertising containing information on distribution channels, publisher, publisher’s website and advertising).
b. Domain: <Tracking domain of the customer>
Cookie Name: tsc
Purpose: This cookie is written when there is a click on an advertisement.
This cookie includes a cookie ID and a list with information on the most recent click touch points, consisting of time, referrer URL, ID of the page in the customer’s shop system and Admedia code (unique identification of the advertising containing information on distribution channels, publisher, publisher’s website and advertising).
c. Domain: <Tracking domain of the customer>
Cookie Name: trackingoptout
Purpose: This cookie is written when there is a click on the opt-out link in order to deactivate tracking for the web browser currently being used on this end device.

An opt-out cookie will be installed that prevents recording of your data on future visits to this website.
The opt-out cookie only works in this browser and for our website and is saved on your device.
If you delete the cookies in this browser, you will have to re-install the opt-out cookie.
