An Overview 
Agora Media, Inc. ("AM," "we" or "us") provides a variety of online services and products ("Services or Sites") to its subscribers.
AM is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information, and providing a safe and secure environment for our subscribers.
The purpose of this AM privacy policy (the "Policy") is to help you understand what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit the Services or Sites, how we may use that information, whether we will disclose it, and how you can correct the information.
Please note that by using the Services or Sites, you signify your agreement with this Policy.
If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services or Sites.
Your continued use of the Services or Sites after any changes to the Policy will mean that you have accepted the changes; therefore please bookmark this page and review it frequently.
If we decide to change the Policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it.
Please note that the Policy applies only to the Services or Sites, and not to other websites to which we link, or to advertisers on the Services or Sites.
Your use of the Services or Sites is governed by AM's Terms of Service and by other published rules pertaining to particular products and services offered throughout the Services or Sites.
==========
Children's Information 
The Services or Sites are not directed toward children under thirteen years of age.
AM does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under thirteen years of age.
If you are under 13 years of age, you should not register to become a Subscriber or provide any personally identifiable information through the Site.
==========
The Information We Gather 
AM collects information from you at several different points on the Services or Sites in the manner set forth below.
AM collects information that can identify you only when it is voluntarily offered.
Whenever we collect personal information, we will make an effort to include a link to the Policy on that page.
==========
Message Board and Chats 
We provide a message board and chats on the Site for discussing topics relating to spirituality.
Although any visitor may read postings on a message board or in a chat, only Members may make posts.
Please note that information you post to a message board or chat, including your profile information, will be available for any user of that service to read, and is therefore no longer private.
AM owns the rights to publish message board posts in other formats.
==========
How We Use The Information That We Gather 
 
AM uses certain technologies, such as "cookies," to improve your experience.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive.
Cookies store information about your visit to the AM Services or Sites and allow you to access AM's features.
The information in the cookie is transmitted from your computer to AM or one of our third-party service companies.
The information contained in these cookies makes it possible for our systems to know if you have logged into the Services or Sites during this visit or during a prior visit, allowing you to navigate the Services or Sites without having to repeatedly log in.
Cookies from AM and/or one of our service providers are also used to collect standard information transmitted from your web browser including: your Internet address, browser type, pages you visited with date and time, purchases you have made on the AM site and the operating system type on your computer.
This information is used to help us understand the needs of our subscribers.
==========
AM may also use cookies to track access into the message boards and forums areas of our Services or Sites and to track whether you have already completed one of our online surveys.
You always have the choice to set your browser to either warn you when a cookie is being accessed on your computer or to refuse to accept cookies.
However, to take full advantage of the features on AM's Services or Sites, we suggest you set your browser to accept cookies.
Setting your computer to accept or refuse cookies varies depending on the software you are running.
Please check the help tab of your browser for specifics on your software.
==========
AM also uses web beacon technology to help us track site usage.
Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow us to track page viewing counts and patterns which we use to focus future content development, measure effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns and assist with capacity planning for the site.
AM also uses web beacons in certain e-mails we send to judge the effectiveness of these mailings.
These web beacons 'sense' if you open the e-mail, if your e-mail program is capable of displaying HTML messages and where you navigate within these HTML messages.
==========
AM always and only uses information obtained from its Subscribers and other users as stated in this Policy and to enhance Subscribers' and other users' experiences on the Services or Sites.
AM does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:  
Disclosure of Personal Information in the Event of Merger or Sale of Assets 
AM, or its related entities, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or all or substantially all of their respective assets could be acquired.
Should such a combination, acquisition or transaction occur, you should expect that AM would share some or all of your personal information with the acquiring or merged entity to continue serving you and other users of the Services or Sites.
==========
Co-branded and Other Affiliated Sites 
Certain information or services offered or provided on or through the Services or Sites from time to time may be provided on or through other sites operated by or in conjunction with third party providers ("Partners").
These sites may have the same "look and feel" of the Services or Sites, and are often co-branded, such that a Partner's logo or name may appear on the site, or the Partner's name may appear in the URL.
Aggregate or personally identifiable information collected about you on these sites may be shared by AM with that Partner.
A Partner will not rent, sell, or disclose any of your personally identifiable information to third parties unless you consent to its doing so, for example, by opting-in while on a particular site to receive information or offers from a Partner's affiliates, partners, or other third parties.
==========
Third Party Links 
You acknowledge that we do not monitor, control or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, including but not limited to any co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in conjunction with AM, or any credit card order processors, product shippers or other third parties who provide services throughout the Services or Sites.
AM assumes no liability or responsibility for the information collection and privacy practices of any third party.
In addition, AM is not responsible for the content of any third party websites, including a third party's use of any cookies or any other information (such as IP address, browser type or operating system) collected when you "click-through" links to their sites or view advertisements served by them.
Even though certain information collected by such third parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies.
==========
In addition, the Services or Sites may provide links to other Internet websites or resources ("Linked Sites").
AM neither controls nor endorses such Linked Sites nor have we reviewed or approved any content that appears on such Linked Sites.
You acknowledge and agree that AM is not responsible for the legality, accuracy or inappropriate nature of any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such Linked Sites.
You further acknowledge and agree that AM shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, and services available on or through any such Linked Site.
Please keep in mind that whenever you participate in an online message board, chat room or other forum or public area on the Services or Sites you provide information that can be collected and used by others that you do not know for the purpose of distributing unsolicited communications.
AM cannot guarantee the security of such information that you disclose online in public areas on the Services or Sites and Subscribers and other users do so at their own risk.
==========
Security 
We use reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers.
However, no security system is impenetrable.
AM cannot warrant or guarantee the security of its servers, nor can it guarantee that information that Subscribers or other users supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to AM over the Internet.
==========
When our registration asks users to enter credit card numbers, that information is encrypted.
Correction/Updating Personal Information 
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire one of our Services or Sites, we allow you to correct, update or remove the personal data that you provided.
This can be done at the "Manage My Account" pages.
Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within AM's databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information.
