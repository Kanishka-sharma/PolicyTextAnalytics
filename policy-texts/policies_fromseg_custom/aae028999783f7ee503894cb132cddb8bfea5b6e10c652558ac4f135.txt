NPR Online's Privacy Policy
At NPR Online, we recognize the importance of privacy to visitors of our Web site.
This privacy policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit our Web site.
NPR does not collect personally-identifying information from the NPR Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.
Visitors under the age of 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally-identifying information to NPR.
All of the information collected by NPR is used for internal NPR or NPR member station purposes only and is not distributed to other outside parties, except when a visitor orders a transcript or audio tape through the NPR Web site.
In that case, relevant information is provided to NPR’s outside fulfillment service for the sole purpose of delivering the requested transcript and/or audio tape.
Like all other Web servers, NPR’s Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site.
These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors.
The access logs do NOT record a visitor’s name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information.
Rather, they contain some or all of the following information:
The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed our Web site.
==========
The date of the visit.
The time of the visit.
The path taken through our Web site.
The browser being used.
==========
A list of files downloaded or viewed.
The amount of time spent listening to RealAudio® or NetShow files.
Any errors encountered.
==========
Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses.
This means that a visitor may have a different IP Address each time he or she visits the NPR Web site.
Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use "Proxy servers" which provide even more anonymity for visitors.
For example, all visitors accessing NPR’s Web site through America Online will be recorded in our access logs as having the same IP Address.
NPR does NOT use "cookies" or other methods of user tracking for the non-participatory sections of our Web site.
==========
NPR does ask visitors to provide certain personal information when they register for a contest or the NPR Your Turn Discussion Board and when they request a transcript and/or audio tape of NPR shows through an online form.
This information is gathered by NPR on a voluntary basis and its use by NPR is limited to the following: contest management, editorial and feedback purposes, fulfillment of transcript and/or audio tape orders, and NPR’s marketing and promotional purposes.
By providing this information, a visitor may receive an e-mail from NPR in limited circumstances.
NPR reserves the right to change this policy.
==========
Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page periodically.
Use of the NPR Web site constitutes consent to any policy then in effect.
