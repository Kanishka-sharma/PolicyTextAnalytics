Key Privacy Points: The Stuff You Really Care About

Your survey data is owned by you.
Not only that, but SurveyMonkey treats your surveys as if they were private.
We don't sell them to anyone and we don’t use the survey responses you collect for our own purposes, except in a limited set of circumstances (e.g. if we are compelled by a subpoena, or if you've made your survey responses public).
==========
We safeguard respondents' email addresses.
To make it easier for you to invite people to take your surveys via email, you may upload lists of email addresses, in which case SurveyMonkey acts as a mere custodian of that data.
We don't sell these email addresses and we use them only as directed by you and in accordance with this policy.
The same goes for any email addresses collected by your surveys.
We keep your data securely.
Read our Security Statement for more information.
Survey data is stored on servers located in the United States.
More information about this is available if you are located in Canada or Europe.
==========
Surveys are administered by survey creators.
Survey creators conduct thousands of surveys each day using our services.
We host the surveys on our websites and collect the responses that you submit to the survey creator.
==========
If you have any questions about a survey you are taking, please contact the survey creator directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that survey or your responses to it.
The survey creator is usually the same person that invited you to take the survey and sometimes they have their own privacy policy.
Are your responses anonymous?
This depends on how the survey creator has configured the survey.
Contact them to find out, or click here to read more about respondent anonymity.
==========
We don't sell your responses to third parties.
SurveyMonkey doesn't sell or share your survey responses with third party advertisers or marketers (although the survey creator might, so check with them).
SurveyMonkey merely acts as a custodian on behalf of the survey creator who controls your data.

Survey Creators & Survey Respondents
SurveyMonkey is used by survey creators (people who create and conduct surveys online) and survey respondents (people who answer those surveys).
The information we receive from survey creators and survey respondents and how we handle it differs, so we have split this privacy policy into two parts.
