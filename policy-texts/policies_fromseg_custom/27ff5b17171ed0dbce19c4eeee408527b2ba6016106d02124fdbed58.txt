Disabling Cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your browser options to block them in the future and you may be able to use other “Do Not Track” browser settings.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to disable cookies altogether, or how to alter the browser’s setting to disable user tracking.
Site visitors who disable their web browser’s ability to accept cookies or alter user tracking will be able to browse the site; however, some site features, may not function if you disable cookies.
Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting.
IETF does not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the site, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
