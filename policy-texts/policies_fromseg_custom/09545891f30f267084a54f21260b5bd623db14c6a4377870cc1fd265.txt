Information We Collect Automatically
The Adelphic Services collect information about your device and the ads that we deliver onto your device.

This practice is sometimes referred to as behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising.
We use this information as part of the Adelphic Services to perform a variety of tasks, such as limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same User (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of Users, or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked.
