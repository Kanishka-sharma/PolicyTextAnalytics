- iOS® Identifier for Advertising (on iOS only), Android™ Advertiser ID (on Android only)

We never access personal identifiable data
For sake of clarity, We do not collect the following Personal Information from an End User: UDID, Android ID, IMEI, MSISDN, name, non-encrypted email address, phone number.
Any publisher of apps using our SDK is obliged to enable You to opt-in for the collection of the information as described above or applying other measures required by local privacy laws applicable to the Service.
Therefore, the publisher of Your app must, as a minimum, enable You to opt-in before the collection of information, for instance by integrating the possibility of an opt-in for the data collection in the starting screen of the app and by providing an opt-out link in the Settings of the app.
==========
If You have opted out, We will delete your data and not continue to collect such information.
Please turn to the publisher of Your app in case You are unable to find the mechanism for such opt-in and opt-out.
You (End User) can also opt-out of the data collection by Predicio from our website.
To do so You have to click the opt-out link below and submit your iOS® Identifier for Advertising (on iOS only), Android™ Advertiser ID (on Android only), and email.
Opting out will not stop advertising from the mobile app(s) integrating our SDK, but will cause Predicio to no longer collect and analyze data from the device of a user.
We may use the data collected through our SDK for the following purposes:
(i) to provide the user with customized services and the display of customized content and products and targeted advertising both on the app of the developer and on other third party apps and websites,
(ii) to ensure the technical functioning of the services of Predicio,
(iii) to improve the algorithms used by Predicio for inferring profile information and other analytics.
Predicio may also aggregate the data with other users' data in order to create statistics about the general use of mobile applications, which helps Predicio to improve existing services or develop new services.
