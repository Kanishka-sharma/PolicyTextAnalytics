Privacy Policy
Effective Date: April 13, 2011
iContact Privacy Policy
This "Privacy Policy" is incorporated by reference in iContact Corporation's end user services agreement posted at www.iContact.com ("EUSA").
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your information.
==========
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and maintain about you when you visit www.iContact.com ("Site") when you use our services, and information collected from other sources, such as information you provide at tradeshows or seminars or to our business partners.
Data Definitions
Generally, we collect and maintain three categories of data: a) account information generated when an individual or entity activates our services - which generally includes contact information and payment information (we call this "Customer Information"); b) data provided by our customers about individuals or entities who consented to our customers transmittal to them of email messages or other types of communications (we call this "Customer Recipient Data"); and c) data about visitors to our Site who may or may not also be our customers.
Although the majority of our customers are businesses, some of the account information submitted to us, and maintained by us, could be used to identify or relate to an individual ("personal data") rather than a business.
What We Do With the Data Collected on Our Site
As explained above, our services are intended for businesses, not individuals.
If you have provided your contact information (which may include personal data) to us, we may use such information to contact you for marketing purposes by various means, including regular mail, email or telephone.
When you activate an iContact account (including a trial account), you expressly consent to receive marketing communications about iContact's services via direct mail, email (at the email address you provided when you activated your account), telephone (at the number you provided when you activated your account), pre-recorded messages (at the number you provided when you activated your account), text messages (if you provided a wireless telephone number), instant messages or other communications methods.
We may also use personal and non-personal (e.g., business-related) data for other purposes, including, but not limited to: 1) providing the services you request; and 2) providing technical support.
==========
In accordance with the applicable terms and conditions set forth in the EUSA, we do not disclose, sell or rent Customer Information or Customer Recipient Data without your prior consent or unless we are required to disclose such information by order or other requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body or applicable law.
Such data is available: 1) to you after you sign up for our service offering(s); 2) to iContact employees who access and manage this information in connection with our services; and 3) to our service providers for purposes of providing functions or services related to our services and customers' accounts (for example, billing functions).
Our data retention policy is described in the EUSA and in the termination policy which is posted on the Site.
==========
Why Do You Receive Email From Us?
If you received one or more e-mails from us, it means that a) your email address is on our list of customers, trial users or prospective customers; or b) you have provided us your email address so that we could contact you.
If you believe you received an email from us in error, please contact us immediately at 
				abuse@icontact.com.
How Can You Stop Receiving Emails From Us?
Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from the lists to which you are subscribed, or to change your expressed interests.
If you do not wish to receive additional emails from iContact, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email.
How Do We Secure the Personal Data We Collect?
==========
We use technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system.
Also, we provide each customer with a unique user name and password that must be entered each time a customer logs in to its account.
No data transmissions over the Internet, however, are guaranteed to be completely secure.
While we strive to protect your data from unauthorized use or disclosure, iContact does not warrant or guarantee the security of the data that you provide to us.

Cookies
When you interact with the Site, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful.
When you come to the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer.
Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer's hard drive to tell site owners whether an individual has visited the website previously.
Standing alone, cookies do not contain personal data, and therefore do not identify you personally.
They merely recognize your browser.
Unless you choose to identify yourself to iContact, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a free trial, you remain anonymous to iContact.
==========
There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based.
Session cookies exist only during an online session.
They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.
They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.
iContact uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged onto the Site.
This information allows iContact to process your online transactions and requests.
==========
Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in to the Service.
You will not be able to use the Service unless you enable your browser to accept cookies from the Site.
iContact uses persistent cookies that only iContact can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a iContact customer or prior Site visitor (whatever the case may be).
We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies.
For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, you must enable cookies in order to use our Service.
==========
Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the Site to help us administer the Site and improve its quality.
Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior.
Such cookies will not be used to associate individual Site visitors with any personal data.
All data collected by such third parties on behalf of iContact is used only to provide us with information on Site usage and will not be shared with any other third parties.

BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY EACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE THE SERVICES.
==========
Services.
The Services assist customers to distribute electronically customer-created content to customers' lists of subscribers, each of whom must have consented previously to the receipt of such content ("Recipients").
While Customer retains iContact to assist with the transmittal of content to its Recipients, Customer acknowledges that iContact does not actually send Customer content to Recipients on Customer's behalf.
The Services comprise primarily of a web-based technology platform through which such content is delivered once Customer sends such content.
==========
Among other things, iContact provides customer support and formatting assistance for the electronic content Customer desires to distribute.
In all cases, iContact simply acts as agent for Customer with its authorization.
Customer agrees that the Services are used only for Customer's business purposes.
If Customer does not intend to use the Services for business purposes, Customer must contact us at customercare@icontact.com.
==========
Site and Policies.
During the Term (as defined below) and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in any guidelines, rules or operating policies that iContact may establish and post from time to time on www.icontact.com (the "Site"), including, without limitation, iContact's anti-spam policy, privacy policy and prohibited content and commerce statement, each of which is incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the "Policies"), iContact agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with the Services.
From time to time, iContact may modify the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and/or in the Policies.
All such changes shall become effective once posted on the Site, and Customer's use of the Services thereafter shall be subject thereto.
In the event of any conflict between any term or condition set forth in this Agreement and in a Policy, the former shall govern.
==========
Customer agrees that its purchase of the Services is neither contingent upon the delivery of any future functionality or features, nor is it dependent upon any oral or written comments made by iContact with respect to future functionality or features.
Professional Services.
In addition to the Services, Customer may purchase certain premium services by making its selection therefor in accordance with the instructions posted at www.icontactplus.com (the "Professional Services"), which Professional Services may be customized pursuant to a mutually agreed upon written statement of work provided to Customer upon the earlier of its request or its selection of desired Professional Services (each, a "Statement of Work").
The Professional Services are provided by iContact separate and distinct from the Services and are not required for Customer's use or enjoyment of the Services.
In the event of any conflict between any term or condition set forth in this Agreement and in a Statement of Work, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in such Statement of Work.
Any Statement of Work may be modified or amended only with the written consent of each of iContact and Customer.
==========
Free Trial Period.
In the event Customer elects to use the Services on a trial basis, Customer will not be billed for such use for a period equal to thirty (30) days or, if a different number of days are posted on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to use the Services, that different number of days, beginning on the date on which Customer first subscribes to use the Services and indicates its agreement with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "Trial Period").
During the Trial Period, Customer's subscriber level limit may not exceed 500 Recipients and Customer's monthly email send limit may not exceed four (4) times the number of permitted Recipients (i.e., 2,000 emails per month), unless a higher subscriber level and/or a higher monthly email send limit are posted on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to use the Services.
The subscriber level and email send limits for the Trial Period are subject to change at any time.
Once Customer completes its free trial period or exceeds any such limit (even if Customer manually removes names from its Recipient list), whichever occurs first, the Trial Period will terminate.
==========
Upon such termination, Customer may purchase a monthly or annual subscription for the Services.
Customer's access to the Services will be disabled until payment therefor is received.
iContact reserves the sole and exclusive right to modify the duration of the Trial Period.
iContact Free Edition.
If Customer subscribes to use the Services through a free customer account ("iContact Free Edition"), Customer's use of the Services will be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions (including subscriber level limits) set forth herein and posted on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to iContact Free Edition.
==========
If Customer exceeds any such limit (even if Customer manually removes names from its Recipient list), its access to the Services may be disabled.
In such event, Customer may purchase a monthly or annual subscription for the Services.
Customer's access to the Services will be disabled until payment therefor is received.
iContact reserves the sole and exclusive right to modify any of these terms, conditions and restrictions.
All such modifications shall become effective once posted on the Site.
==========
Customer acknowledges and understands that its use of the Service through iContact Free Edition may be limited in terms of functionality, features and support as compared with the Services provided through iContact's standard paid customer accounts.
Customer may upgrade from iContact Free Edition to a standard paid customer account at any time.
Purchase.
Pricing for the Services is based upon the subscriber level Customer chooses to purchase as indicated on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to use the Service or in a negotiated sales order, as the case may be (in either case, the "Sales Order").
The Sales Order records Customer's subscriber level, term, subscription fee, payment method and other account information.
If the number of Recipients stored in Customer's account exceeds the subscriber level set forth in the Sales Order, Customer's access to and use of the Services will be disabled until Customer: (i) reduces the number of Recipients stored in Customer's account; or (ii) upgrades its subscriber level to at least equal the number of Recipients stored in its account.
Customer may upgrade (but not downgrade) Customer's subscriber level at any time during the term of this Agreement.
The total number of emails per month that may be sent by Customer cannot exceed six (6) times the subscriber level limit.
For example, if Customer's subscriber level limit is 100,000, Customer can send up to 600,000 emails per month.
If Customer requires a sending limit higher than six (6) times Customer's subscriber level limit per month, Customer should contact iContact's sales group at sales@icontact.com or 866-775-4254.
Fees and Payment.
In consideration for the Services to be provided by iContact (other than through iContact Free Edition), Customer agrees to pay the monthly subscription fees set forth in the Sales Order (the "Subscription Fees").
Paid Subscription Fees are non-refundable.
Customer acknowledges that from time to time, delivery of email messages sent using the Services may be blocked or prevented at destination email servers.
Customer's payment obligation set forth herein continues regardless of whether delivery of such email messages is prevented or blocked.
In consideration for the Professional Services to be provided by iContact, if any, Customer agrees to pay the fees posted at www.icontactplus.com, set forth in the Statement of Work or as otherwise provided to Customer by iContact, (the "Professional Fees," together with the Subscription Fees, the "Fees").
Payments for Fees and reimbursements for expenses, if any, will be billed monthly and will be due immediately upon receipt of invoice; or may be pre-paid in advance; or otherwise may be paid pursuant to the terms set forth in the Sales Order.
==========
The Fees shall include all applicable foreign, federal, state and local taxes payable with respect to this Agreement.
If Customer is paying for the Services by credit card and such credit card is declined, iContact will send Customer notice thereof to Customer's email address on record.
If Customer misses a payment, iContact may notify Customer by phone or mail, but has no obligation to do so.
Any payment due and not received by iContact by the due date may be subject, at iContact's sole discretion, to a late fee equal to 1.5% (or the maximum rate permitted by law) of the amount then due, for each month overdue until paid in full.
In the event Customer fails to make timely payments when due, iContact may, at its election, discontinue, terminate or suspend the Services, without incurring any liability to Customer.
Despite any such discontinuation or suspension, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it will be required to pay the Fees until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the termination provisions set forth herein.
For amounts outstanding after ninety (90) days from its receipt of the invoice therefor, Customer shall be responsible for and agrees to pay reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including, but not limited to, court and attorneys' fees and expenses.
==========
From time to time, and at any time, iContact may require reasonable credit guarantees before continuing its provision of the Services or the Professional Services hereunder.
Customer's Recipient Data.
In offering the Services, we may collect personal information about Recipients.
iContact will not own any data, information or material that Customer submits to iContact in connection with the Services ("Customer Recipient Data").
Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all Customer Recipient Data, and Customer is responsible for maintaining, securing and storing all Customer Recipient Data in accordance with applicable law.

Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement and Customer's payment of all unpaid and outstanding Fees, and Customer's written request received by iContact within thirty (30) days of such expiration or termination, iContact will provide Customer with an electronic file of the Customer Recipient Data.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that after the thirtieth (30th) day following any such termination or expiration, iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data and may delete and destroy such Customer Recipient Data without providing Customer with notice of such deletion.
If Customer uses the Services during a Trial Period and fails to convert its account to iContact Free Edition or a standard paid customer account upon the expiration or other termination thereof, iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data after the date of such expiration or termination.
If Customer uses the Services through iContact Free Edition and fails to use the Services for at least sixty (60) consecutive days, as of the sixty-first (61st) day after Customer's last use of the Services, Customer acknowledges and agrees that iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data and may delete and destroy such data without providing Customer with notice of such deletion.

Customer agrees to maintain the Passwords in strict confidence and not to provide the Passwords to any third party.
Customer will notify iContact promptly if there is a loss or compromise of any Passwords and Customer will be solely responsible for all actions and fees incurred as a result of such incident resulting from the Customer's negligence or intentional misconduct.

Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive terms equal to the same period of time as the Initial Term (each, a "Successive Term," together with the Initial Term, the "Term"), and you will continue to be billed for the Fees until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.
At any time during the Term, either Customer or iContact may terminate this Agreement for any reason.
If Customer desires to terminate this Agreement, Customer may request a termination by calling iContact at 866-936-5680, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. (EST) and 8:00 p.m. (EST) (a "Valid Termination Notice").
Customer acknowledges that allowing a credit card to expire or failing to submit payment by check does not constitute a Valid Termination Notice.
==========
Any Customer termination request that occurs in the middle of a payment term (whether monthly, quarterly or annually, as set forth in the Sales Order) will be made effective on the final day of such term.
If Customer wishes to terminate only the Professional Services, it should contact its account manager prior to such services being performed.
iContact may terminate this Agreement immediately effective upon delivery to Customer of notice thereof.
Such right to terminate this Agreement shall include iContact's right to terminate its provision of the Services and/or the Professional Services (as applicable) and to pursue all available equitable and legal remedies (in the event Customer breaches any term or condition, or any of its representations or warranties set forth herein).
Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all Customer Recipient Data may be destroyed and deleted in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section 8 above.
Notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer will remain obligated to pay iContact Fees which were incurred prior to (and on) the effective date of such termination or expiration, as the case may be.
