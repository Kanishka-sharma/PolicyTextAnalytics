If you would like to consider your options for limiting use of such information by these advertising companies, or would like to learn more about their practices, please consult the Network Advertising Initiative website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/.
==========

Cookies from other service providers:  We also use third-party vendors to help us better understand our user demographics.
These vendors may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags in connection with the Sites to provide their services to us.
Some of the games available on the Site are also provided by third parties and such third parties may place a flash cookie on your computer to enable you to play the game.
