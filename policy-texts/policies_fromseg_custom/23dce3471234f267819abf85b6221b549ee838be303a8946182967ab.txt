What information we collect
When you visit our website, you provide us with two types of information: personal information that identifies you (such as your name and email address) and non-personal information (such as your IP address and browser type) that does not identify you personally, but gives us information about your computer and about your activities on our site.
This information includes your IP address, your browser type, the date and time you access the site, and the website that referred you to our site.
==========
We also collect and store information from your computer using “cookies.”
A cookie is a small file stored on your computer that is tied to information about you.
For example, when you sign in to your My Ticketmaster account, cookies will be used to save your email address and name so the next time you visit your my Ticketmaster account from the same computer we will “remember” your email address and name in order to make your experience faster and simpler.
For more information on cookies, click here.
We may also use “web beacons,” which track your use of our website in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience the next time you visit.
To learn more about web beacons, click here.
If you buy or sell a ticket or enroll in a program or special offer on our website, we will collect financial information from you (your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.).
==========
From time to time, we also may ask you some questions about yourself (such as your interests and activities, your age, etc.) so we know how to serve you better.
You don’t have to answer these questions if you’d rather not.
Finally, we also may receive information about you from third parties (such as updated delivery and address information, purchase history and additional demographic information), and we may allow third parties to display advertisements on our site.
These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about people who view or interact with their advertisements on our site.
This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and judge their effectiveness.
We do not provide any personal information about you to these third parties.
Some of these third parties may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a website to opt out of ad targeting from several advertising companies (www.networkadvertising.org).
==========
We protect your information
We know it is very important to protect the information you share with us.
We take appropriate security measures to help safeguard this information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access your personal information, and they may do so only for limited reasons.
We also encrypt credit card numbers and other sensitive information before it is sent from your computer to ours.
We also use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.
==========
You should feel confident using our website.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Although we take very significant steps to secure your information, there is always a chance that your information will not always remain secure, and you should always take great care in handling and disclosing your personal information.
For example, avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
==========
How we use your information
In general, we may use information that we collect about you in the following ways:
to process payment for purchases or sales you make;
to deliver the tickets, products and services you request;
to enroll you in programs in which you choose to participate;
to manage your account and provide you with customer service;
to perform research and analyze your use of, or interest in, our products, services or content (or products, services or content offered by others on our website);
to communicate with you by e-mail, regular mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, our affiliated companies or other third parties;
to help us develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our website and other websites;
to verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;
to enforce our terms and conditions;
to protect against or identify fraudulent transactions;
to generally manage our business; and
to perform other functions, which we will describe to you at the time we collect the information.
When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.
We may share your personal information with:
Authorized service providers.
Our authorized service providers are companies that perform certain services on our behalf.
These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analyses, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features we offer.
These service providers may have access to your personal information to the extent necessary to perform their functions, but we do not allow them to share or use any of your personal information for any other purpose.
==========
Ticketmaster affiliates.
We may share information we collect, including personal information, with Ticketmaster-owned or affiliated businesses.
For a complete list of all Ticketmaster businesses, visit www.ticketmaster.com/h/about_us.html.
Sharing information with our affiliates enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.
All Ticketmaster companies comply with applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future.
Business partners.
==========
When you make a purchase or participate in a promotion, we may share your personal information with the merchants offering the products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes.
We won’t share your personal information with these businesses unless you choose to participate in their offer or program.
When you choose to engage in a particular offer or program, you authorize us to share your email address and other information with the relevant merchant.
==========
Event providers.
We sell tickets on behalf of others; we don’t organize, produce or otherwise bring you events.
The venues, promoters, artists’ representatives and fan clubs, teams, leagues and others who are involved in or bring you events are known as “event providers.”
When you buy or sell tickets or bid in an auction on our site (or try to do these things), you consent to allow us to provide your personal information to the event providers and their contractors.
We share this information so event providers can contact you about the event or other events you may be interested in.
==========
Direct mail partners.
From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you.
If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any time by emailing us at legal@ticketmaster.com.
==========
Other Situations.
We also may disclose your information:
In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
==========
We may share your non-personal information in any of the above circumstances.
Also, we may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for general business analysis purposes.
For example, we may provide our advertisers with the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed.
This information does not contain any personal information.
==========
It may be used to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our website and on websites of third parties.
Third-party websites
Third parties have their own privacy policies that govern their use of your information.
There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that don’t operate under this Privacy Policy.
For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we don’t control.
==========
These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you.
Importantly, these third parties will have their own privacy policies describing how they use and disclose your personal information.
Those policies will govern the use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once you or we have shared it with those third parties.
If you want to learn more about other entities’ privacy practices, please review the websites of those third parties.
Privacy policies are typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
If you have any questions about how a third party handles personal information, please contact that third party directly.
Job applicants
If you apply for a position with Ticketmaster and submit your personal information through our website, the information you submit will be used only in connection with considering and acting upon your application.
We may retain your personal information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future available positions.
==========
How you can access your information
If you have a My Ticketmaster account, you can quickly and easily review and update your personal information online by logging into your account.
You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us by regular mail or email at:
Privacy Officer
c/o Ticketmaster Legal
8800 W. Sunset Blvd.
West Hollywood, CA 90069
legal@ticketmaster.com
If you have a My Ticketmaster account, you also may close your account at any time by contacting Ticketmaster customer service at (800) 653-8000.
If you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to your account or access any of your personal information.
However, you can open a new account at any time.
==========
If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we think are necessary to protect the integrity of our website or to protect our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
Please note that if we have already provided information about you to third parties (for example, if we’ve already sent your information to an event provider), or if you’ve given information to a third party (for example, by clicking on a website link taking you to a third party’s website, and you provided your contact information to that third party), retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.
If you receive an unwanted email from a third party, you’ll have to opt-out from receiving further emails from that party itself.
Your choices about your personal information
You can choose not to provide us with certain information.
However, that may result in your not being able to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order to use those features.
==========
For example, in order to open a My Ticketmaster account, purchase or sell tickets, or participate in a contest, promotion or sweepstakes, your personal information will be required.
At any time, you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by clicking on My Ticketmaster and following the instructions to “manage your email alerts.”
You may modify your choices at any time in your My Ticketmaster account.
Also, in any commercial email we send, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving such messages in the future by clicking on the link at the bottom of the email that says “unsubscribe.”
It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.
Even if you have unsubscribed from receiving promotional emails from us, we may send you other types of important e-mail communications without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
==========
These may include customer service announcements, administrative notices and surveys.
Please note that changing information in your My Ticketmaster account or opting out of receiving promotional email communications will affect only future communications from us.
If we already provided your information to a third party (such as an event provider) before you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party as well.
==========
Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews and chat rooms
We may provide areas on our website where you can post information about yourself, communicate with others, post reviews or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.).
Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use, so be sure to review them before posting.
In addition, keep in mind that postings may appear on other websites or when searches are conducted on search engines on the subject of your posting.
==========
Also, whenever you disclose personal information publicly (such as on publicly viewable web pages), that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited email messages.
We can’t control who reads your posting or what others may do with information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to use your discretion with respect to posting personal information.
==========

Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
