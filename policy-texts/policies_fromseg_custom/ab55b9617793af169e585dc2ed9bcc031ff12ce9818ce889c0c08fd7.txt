Comments Terms of Use
The comments sections on GM Sites are accessible to users by invitation only (such invitations coming either from Gawker Media editors directly or by referral from existing comment users).
GM's comment user registration system has been designed so that, if the user so chooses, they can remain completely anonymous, even to us.
==========
In order to make our comments useful and interesting, the following guidelines have been established for comment users:
Do not post threatening, harassing, defamatory, or libelous material.
Do not intentionally make false or misleading statements.
Do not offer to sell or buy any product or service.
==========
Do not post material that infringes copyright.
Do not post information that you know to be confidential or sensitive or otherwise in breach of the law.
Keep all comments relevant to the particular GM Site where the comment is being posted.
Gawker Media will not accept responsibility for information posted in the Comments.
Please note that once you post a comment to one of our sites, it becomes part of the public conversation.
Our policy is that we will not remove a user's comments unless we deem them to be in violation of our Terms of Service.
So if you want to say something that you will later regret personally, it is advisable that you use a username that does not identify you.
==========
We cannot remove your comments simply because you have a change of heart about making them.
However, Gawker Media reserves the right to remove comments entirely at its discretion, including for alleged violations of terms of service or legal rights.
Gawker is not responsible for the content of user comments.
If a third party complains that your comment violates our TOS or their rights, we will invite them to respond in the comments themselves.
If they pursue the complaint, we will make reasonable efforts to contact you by the means you have provided us, to alert you to the situation.
We will protect your contact information as described in our privacy policy, but may be compelled to turn it over pursuant to legal process.
==========
Image Terms of Use
Gawker Media sites typically display images as part of blog posts written by our editors.
The types of images editors are authorized to use on Gawker Media sites include:
Images licensed from photographic archive vendors
Images supplied to our editors or released into the public domain by public relations and marketing companies for press purposes
Reader-submitted images, with the implied representation that the person submitting the image owns the copyright in the image and the right to give it to us for use on our site(s)
Images published on Flickr or other public photo sites with licenses granted under Creative Commons, with attribution in accordance with the CC license granted in each case
Images commissioned by Gawker Media
Images that we believe to be covered by the Fair Use Doctrine, taking into account factors such as:
The purpose and character of the use (i.e. transformation from the original, use for criticism, satire or parody
The nature of the copyrighted work (i.e. factual or newsworthy vs creative works)
The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole (i.e. use of cropped, reduced, low-resolution images used for no more than to convey the point made)
The effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work (e.g. use that is not substitutive for the original, or would never be licensed in any event)
If Gawker Media receives notice that an image posted is not in keeping with these terms and conditions or the intended use of the Comments section where it is posted, we reserve to right to remove that image.
If you think we have published an image or text that infringes your copyright, we will address your concerns; however, if the image falls into one of the categories listed above, we believe that our use of the image is legitimate and we will not remove it from the site.
Please note that we will respond only to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
The text of the Act can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://lcWeb.loc.gov/copyright/
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written communication (by email with an attached and signed PDF or by fax) that sets forth the items specified below.
==========
Please do not send us regular mail, as we may not receive it in a timely fashion.
In all cases, if you do not hear a response from us within 10 days of submitting a complaint, please telephone us at (212) 655-9524 x432 to confirm that we received your original complaint.
Spam blockers sometimes devour important emails from strangers!
==========
To enable us to address your concerns, please provide the following information:
For each allegedly infringing image or piece of text that you wish to have removed from one of our sites, provide the exact permanent URL for the page containing the material.
Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you: an email address is preferred, as well as a telephone contact number.
Provide the following information detailing your claim to ownership of the copyright in the allegedly infringing material:
Proof of copyright in the image or text concerned, namely proof of registration of the Image under the DMCA,
OR, absent such registration,
a detailed description of where the photograph was taken, by whom, who or what the subject of the image is, AND
Evidence to support your claim that you own the copyright in the image.
We will not comply with requests to remove an image where the complainant cannot prove that they own the copyright in the image in question.
==========
Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
Sign the document and fax it to:
(917) 591-7090, Attn: Gawker Legal / DMCA Complaints
OR email it to:

Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that any material on our sites is infringing your copyrights.
Indeed, in a recent case a company that sent an infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the Fair Use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys’ fees.
The company agreed to pay over $100,000.
Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
Please note that a copy of each legal notice we receive will be sent (with your personal information removed) to Chilling Effects for publication.
