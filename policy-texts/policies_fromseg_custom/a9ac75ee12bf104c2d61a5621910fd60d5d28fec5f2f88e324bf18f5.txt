Information Gathered About You and How We Use It
We collect information from you when you access one of the Sites and when you subscribe to our email services.
We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Sites such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature.
On one or more of our sites, we use web analytics tools, including primarily Google Analytics (Google privacy policy is at http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html).
We use collected information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Sites.
We use your IP address to administer our website by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, (2) where our users come from (i.e., a referring sign or a search engine, etc.), and (3) which portions of our audience come from within or outside the Bryn Mawr College network.
We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable unless we are required to do so under applicable law or court order.
Any email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.

We may use your user information in order to process student, financial aid or job applications, student or employee registrations, and other services and benefits that we provide to our students, employees and other persons.
User information may be shared with third-party partners to the extent necessary for such third parties to provide services to us or to users, or provide and improve web services or other communications to users.
We may also provide your information to third parties in circumstances in which we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect rights, property or safety.

These "third-party cookies" may, for example, originate from websites such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus or other social media services.
