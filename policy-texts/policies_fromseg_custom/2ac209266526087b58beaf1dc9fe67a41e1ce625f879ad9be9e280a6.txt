What is WhitePages?
WhitePages is a privately-held company located in Seattle, WA.
Our purpose is to make it fantastically simple for everyone to connect with confidence.
Is WhitePages the "phone company"?
No.
WhitePages is not owned by or affiliated with any phone company.
==========
Where do you get the information for your listings?
We get our listing information for home and work listings in these three ways:
Publicly Available Information Sources This is what it sounds like: information that's available to the public.
It includes addresses, street names, cities, states and ZIP codes.
Other examples of publicly available information include published phone directories and information published on the Internet.
Third-Party Data Suppliers Information from third-party data suppliers originates from a variety of sources.
It may include publicly available information, such as phone directories, as well as information from other sources.
==========
For example, people often provide name, address, phone number, email address and other personal information when filling out forms for contests, sweepstakes, subscriptions or other similar offers.
Often, this information can be shared with third parties.
Whenever you provide personal information – either online or offline – you should understand how the information will be used and whether it can be shared with third parties.
==========
Member-Published Listings We obtain a portion of our listings from members who add their cell phone number or email address directly to our website.
Member-added listings have this logo next to their listing:
If listing information is not on WhitePages, it is either unavailable or has been removed from our websites.
You can choose to remove your listing from our site.
To do so now, click here.
Why does WhitePages include age ranges, job titles and other information?
Our goal is to make it fantastically simple for everyone to connect with confidence.
Based on extensive feedback from our members, attributes such as age and occupation are helpful in identifying the person they are searching for, especially if there are multiple results for a search.
Why does WhitePages include maps and directions?
Because our members want them!
We do a lot of research and talk frequently with members.
==========
They overwhelmingly say that maps and driving directions are two of the most important and useful features on WhitePages.
How can I remove my listing information from WhitePages?
Easy.
==========
To remove a home or work listing, just follow these three steps:
Search WhitePages for the listing you want to remove.
If your search includes multiple results, find and click on your name.
On the Details page, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
Look for the link that says, "Remove this listing."
Click the link and follow the instructions to remove your listing.
==========
Following this process will remove published listing information (e.g. name, address and phone number) from WhitePages.
Removing your published listing information will not remove information displayed through advertisements or other pages where non-listing information is displayed.
For example, when doing a reverse phone search, we will return the city, state and phone "type" if full listing information is not available.
On our "Names Popularity" pages we provide general information about names.
No personally identifiable listing information is displayed in these cases and this information cannot be removed.
Will WhitePages re-publish listing information after it's removed?
We take steps to block the re-publication of listing information that's been removed by a member.
==========
However, similar listing information may be published.
Here's why: if you move or change your name, a listing with your new information may appear on WhitePages.
There's nothing we can do about that.
But, you can always remove new listing information that may appear.
We encourage you to visit WhitePages regularly to check for newly published information.
==========
If you choose, go ahead and remove it.
What other ways can I protect my information?
There are a number of steps you can take to control how and where your listing information appears on the Internet.
==========
Understand the fine print on "free" offers.
When something is advertised as "free" it often means that – in return for a free service or chance to win a prize – you must provide information about yourself.
If you're concerned about having your info shared with third parties, be sure to read the fine print before you hand over your name, address, etc.
Read websites' privacy policies (and other fine print).
Privacy policies tell users how their information is collected, used and shared.
Be sure to read a company's privacy policy before providing any personally identifiable information.
It's also a good idea to review the terms of use/service to understand a company's principles regarding your use of their products and services.
==========
Get a P.O. Box.
One of the most effective and inexpensive things you can do to keep your home address private is to get a post office box.
Once you have one, submit a permanent change of address to that P.O. Box and use that address when filling out forms and applications.
Taking these steps helps reduce the circulation of your home address, both online and offline.
==========
Use available technology.
Here are a few useful technologies that protect your information:
o Block "caller ID" on your phone.
o Use spam-blocker, anti-virus and anti-spyware software on your computer.
o Obtain your annual free credit report online.
There's only one online source authorized to do that, and it's here: annualcreditreport.com
o Set your web browser's privacy settings to your preference.
Be vigilant.
==========
WhitePages offers a fast, easy and free method for you to remove information from our websites.
Click here.
Unfortunately, not every company that publishes listing information offers the same level of service.
Your ability to control personal information held by offline companies is even less accessible.
If there is not a clear path to remove your information from a company's website or records, we recommend that you contact the company directly to request the removal of your information.
==========
Persistence is often the key to success.
Develop a personal privacy routine.
Create a privacy schedule and set reminders for yourself.
Spend time searching for and removing information that you wish to keep private.
By establishing a sensible, recurring, privacy-centric routine, you will be better able to control and maintain your privacy preferences.
