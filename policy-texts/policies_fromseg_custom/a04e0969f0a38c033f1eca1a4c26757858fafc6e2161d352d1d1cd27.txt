Privacy Policy

Revised May 25, 2018

 
The following is the Better Business Bureau online privacy policy, which governs how visitor information (your information)
is gathered and used on BBB Internet sites, including the sites of our affiliated organizations, Council of Better Business
Bureaus, independent BBBs, BBB Institute for Marketplace Trust, BBB EU Privacy Shield Dispute Resolution Program and
the Advertising Self-Regulatory Council (collectively referred to as "BBB”).
Please take a few minutes to read this policy carefully.
==========
Please note that BBB Wise Giving Alliance has a separate privacy policy published on give.org.
With the limited exception of the BBB EU Privacy Shield Program (see below), BBB provides its nonprofit services to businesses
and consumers in North America.
For this reason, GDPR does not apply to data that BBB obtains through its interactions
with businesses and services - except for the specific data obtained through administration of the BBB EU Privacy Shield
Program, which is discussed in a separate section below.
Your Information that BBB May Collect Online
 You can affirmatively submit to BBB certain user information pertaining to your interaction with BBB.
==========
User information
may include a search query (such as the name and location of a business or charity) or other information as described
more fully below.
You can also provide location information (so that you can search near you or in an area you specify),
or billing or donation information.
We also may infer your geographic location based on your IP address or other information.
==========
User information may also include information pertaining to a marketplace complaint, such as your name, postal and e-mail
address, phone and facsimile numbers, vehicle information such as vehicle identification number, and description of the
complaint or customer review.
When you submit a comment to a blog post on the BBB website, you also submit your name and email address to BBB.
BBB may
share that information with a third party, if a third party originated the blog post.
When you apply to be a BBB arbitrator,
you submit your name, address and other contact information, and information about your qualifications.
BBB may also
collect information from a business that inquiries about National Partner sponsorship, BBB accreditation, conference
attendance or program participation, some of which could constitute identifying information about a sole proprietor,
as well as identifying information from individuals acting in their business capacity.
==========
If you report a scam through BBB
Scam Tracker, you submit to BBB your name, state/province, postal code, email address and, if elected, telephone number.
Some applications on BBB websites to which you may submit comments or other information are administered by third parties.
These applications collect, use and share information under third party privacy policies.
==========
bbb.org utilizes Google Maps API to provide consumers with the location of user selected businesses.
This feature
is added at the option of business.
The user has the option to request directions to the business through Maps API.

Notice For EU and EEA Individuals - BBB EU Privacy Shield and the GDPR

BBB operates the BBB EU Privacy Shield Dispute Resolution Program ("BBB EUPS"), an independent recourse mechanism ("IRM")
supporting the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
BBB EUPS handles privacy complaints from individuals in the European Union
("EU"), the European Economic Area ("EEA") and Switzerland regarding their personal data transferred to the United States
pursuant to Privacy Shield and processed by US organizations ("Participating Businesses") that have designated BBB EUPS
as their IRM.
==========
With respect to personal data BBB collects from individuals in the EU and EEA in the course of BBB EUPS
operations, BBB is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").
Information BBB collects about EU/EEA Complainants
 BBB collects personal data when you submit a privacy complaint using the BBB EUPS online complaint form, and during
any subsequent contacts you have with BBB staff by electronic mail or telephone in relation to your Privacy Shield complaint.
Except as otherwise indicated below, BBB EUPS does not collect personally identifiable information or personal data unless
you voluntarily provide it to us, and limits the personal data it collects to information relevant for the purposes of
processing.
Types of personal data we collect include your name, full address, phone number, and email address, as well
as documents and other information you may provide to us to authenticate your identity or substantiate your complaint.
In the course of handling your complaint, we may also collect information about you from the Participating Business against
which you filed your complaint.
==========
How BBB EUPS Uses Your Personal Data
 BBB EUPS may process your Personal Data for the following purposes:

Effective complaint handling, including verifying your identity and location; making eligibility determinations; and
facilitating communications between you and BBB, and between BBB and the participating business that is a party to
your case, as well as any independent Panelist conducting a Data Privacy Review of your complaint, in the conduct
of the case.
Preparing and publishing reports as required under Privacy Shield or by the BBB EUPS Procedure Rules.
Providing information you may request about the services of BBB EUPS, and answering your questions.
Investigating and processing suspected violations of BBB EUPS's Procedure Rules.
==========
Complying with BBB EUPS obligations as an IRM under Privacy Shield, including (i) provision of complaint data to the
appropriate governmental authorities and (ii) complying with applicable data retention obligations.
Bases for Processing
 To process the personal data of BBB EUPS complainants as described above, BBB relies on the following independent legal
bases under GDPR: BBB carries out tasks in the public interest; processing is necessary for BBB's legitimate interests;
and BBB receives complainants' express consent to process their personal data.
Public Interest.
==========
BBB is a widely recognized not-for-profit self-regulatory organization that operates numerous alternative
dispute resolution (ADR) programs in North America, including BBB EU Privacy Shield.
The alternative dispute resolution
programs of organizations such as BBB are sanctioned by the laws of many countries, most of which acknowledge the importance
of ADR's role as an important channel in the administration of justice.
==========
The personal data collected by BBB EU Privacy
Shield in processing privacy complaints from EU and EEA individuals is essential to BBB's performance of its dispute
resolution function under Privacy Shield, which constitutes "a task in the public interest" as a basis for collecting
and maintaining such information under the GDPR.
Legitimate interests.
Personal data related to complainants is collected only to the extent necessary given BBB's legitimate
interests as a data controller, in its role as an independent recourse mechanism (IRM) providing dispute resolution services
to individuals in the EU/EEA with privacy complaints against U.S. businesses participating in the Privacy Shield Frameworks
that have identified BBB EUPS as their IRM.
Consent.
Before completing the BBB EUPS online complaint form, BBB requests your express consent to our processing of your
personal data in the United States.
If you withdraw your consent to processing before we make an eligibility determination
regarding your complaint and open a case, we will discontinue your complaint and delete your information.
After a case
has been opened, BBB may proceed with processing on the alternative legal bases set forth above, or where legally obligated
to do so.
==========
Sharing Your Personal Data with Third Parties
 BBB may share your Personal Data with (i) a BBB EUPS Participating Business against which you have submitted a complaint,
in order to process the complaint; (ii) independent Data Privacy Panelists we may assign to arbitrate your complaint,
should you request a Data Privacy Review; and (iii) BBB's service providers, including data processors, in order to deliver
the services provided by BBB EUPS.
Data Retention
 BBB will store your Personal Data provided to BBB EUPS for as long as necessary to perform the purposes of processing,
which include handling your complaint to its final resolution; producing required reports pursuant to Privacy Shield
and to the BBB EUPS Procedure Rules; and otherwise complying with our legal and regulatory obligations.
Security
 Personal data that you provide to BBB EUPS is stored by BBB on servers located in third party data centers in the United
States with restricted access, that have implemented reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to, and the
misuse of, personal data.
BBB restricts access to your personal data to authorized BBB employees, independent contractors
and service providers who need to access the data in order to provide services in support of the BBB EUPS program.
BBB has taken steps to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems and services
processing personal information collected by BBB EUPS, and will restore the availability and access to information in
a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
When BBB transmits BBB EUPS complaint-related information over the internet, we protect it through the use of data encryption
methods.
GDPR Rights for EU/EEA Individuals
 Subject to some limits, individuals in the EU and EEA countries have a number of rights regarding personal data collected
by BBB in the course of BBB EUPS complaint handling, under certain conditions as described in the GDPR.
==========
Right of access and portability.
The right to obtain access to your personal information, along with certain related
information, and to receive that information in a commonly used format and to have it transferred to another data
controller;

Right to rectification.
The right to obtain rectification of your personal information without undue delay where that
personal information is inaccurate or incomplete;
Right to erasure.
==========
The right to obtain the erasure of your personal information without undue delay in certain circumstances,
such as where the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected
or processed;
Right to restriction.
The right to obtain the restriction of the processing undertaken by us on your personal information
in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of the personal information is contested by you, for a period
enabling us to verify the accuracy of that personal information; or where BBB no longer needs to retain the personal
data, but you would like us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
==========
Right to object.
The right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal
information.
==========
If you need further assistance regarding the above rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below
and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law.
privacy@council.bbb.org

In some cases our ability to uphold one or more of these rights for you may be limited, in light of BBB's role as a private
organization providing ADR services through BBB EUPS in the public interest, or for security, safety, fraud prevention
reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services
you have requested.
Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.
==========
EU and EEA individuals also have the right to lodge a privacy complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority.
