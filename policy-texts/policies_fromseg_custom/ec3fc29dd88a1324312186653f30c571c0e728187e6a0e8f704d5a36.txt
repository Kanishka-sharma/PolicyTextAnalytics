Introduction
Today's Internet is full of good content.
==========
Some of it is not available for free, but the majority is.
At this point, you've probably often asked yourself how exactly the latter services, e.g. websites or apps, earn their money to provide high-quality content (news, lifestyle blogs, games & Co.) regularly.
==========
A key way to monetize such content is user-oriented advertising.
For example, in the form of display or video ads.
==========
Over time, technology has evolved.
As a result, today you get ads that you are interested in and which are relevant to you.
==========
The digital advertising ecosystem ("AdTech Industry") consists of a variety of stakeholders such as advertising clients, agencies, measurement services, and many other providers of advertising technology.
VLYBY Digital GmbH ("VLYBY" or "we") is an integral part of the digital advertising infrastructure.
==========
In the following, we provide an overview of how our technology works and what contribution we make to data protection.
VLYBY as a technology supplier
We are a technology supplier.
With the help of our solution, operators of websites and/or digital content (collectively "Publishers") can show (video) advertising on their websites and/or mobile applications ("Digital Offers").
VLYBY provides Publishers with a 'single tag solution, a technology that technically enables Publishers to display (video) ads on their Digital Offers ("Technology").
Example: If you scroll down your favourite online blog and a video ad appears within a text as soon as it is viewable: We provide the appropriate infrastructure in order to show this video.
This Technology is to be understood as a kind of connector.
==========
In addition to the Publisher, on the one hand, we also work with partners such as marketers demand side platforms ("DSPs") or sell side platform ("SSPs") (collectively referred to as "Demand Partners") who, with the appropriate technologies and advertising material, deliver the advertising content that is displayed within the advertising spaces on the Publishers' Digital Offers.
As a general note, our Technology that Publishers integrate into their Digital Offers neither sets or reads any identifiers such as cookies IDs or mobile identifiers of the user's devices.
However, our Technology may include Demand Partners' technologies (e.g. ad player) that include Demand Partners' cookies or other trackers, which can be dropped when an ad is served to a user on a Digital Offer.
VLYBY as an advertising service provider
In some cases, Publishers not only integrate our Technology into their Digital Offers but also engage with us as an advertising service provider.
When providing our advertising services ("Services") we act as the 'middleman' between Publishers and the other stakeholders in the AdTech Industry (e.g. Demand Partners).
In particular, we  technically support Publishers to monetize their ad space and serve relevant (video) ads on their Digital Offers.
==========
In these scenarios, we may (but do not necessarily) process information related to an ad space and/or a (video) ad that is considered personal data under applicable data protection law, including but not limited to General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and Federal Data Protection Act ("Bundesdatenschutzgesetz" or "BDSG").
Whilst, as a general principle, we only process personal data in accordance with Publishers' instructions (section III.1) and consider ourselves a data processor ("Processor", Art. 28 GDPR) we require certain personal data from Publishers in order to enable Publishers to use our Technology and provide Services to them (section III.2).
For these use cases, we consider ourselves a data controller ("Controller", Art. 4 (7) GDPR).
