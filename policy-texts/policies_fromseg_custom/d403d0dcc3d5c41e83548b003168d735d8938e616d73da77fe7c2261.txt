We may reach out to you in different ways, for example, to tell you about a new Adobe app we think you'd be interested in, or to show you how to use a particular feature we think you may enjoy.
However, you can also let us know that you'd rather not hear from us with this type of communication.
Adobe email, telephone, and postal mail marketing
If you agree to receive email, telephone, or postal mail marketing from us, we try to make it useful for you based on your likely interests.
Please let us know if you’d rather not hear from us.
==========
If you are a business customer and agreed to receive Adobe marketing communications, we may share your information with our resellers and other sales partners.
We do not share personal information about consumers with third parties for their own marketing purposes unless the consumer agreed to that sharing.

Tailoring Adobe apps and websites to your interests
When you are using an Adobe app or website, we may show you content, offers, or recommendations that are based on your likely interests.
Learn about your privacy choices related to content, offers, and recommendations tailored to your likely interests.
Adobe interest-based advertising
Adobe runs online ad campaigns that display ads for you based on your likely interests.
We may learn your likely interests when you use our apps and websites.
We also acquire information from other companies that gives us more insight about your likely interests based on your activity on non-Adobe web pages and mobile apps.
These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads” or “online behavioral advertising.”
We use ad platforms to display Adobe ads on non-Adobe web pages and in non-Adobe apps.
The ad platforms we hire to display these ads set their own cookies, web beacons, and other identifiers to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests.
We and our ad platforms learn information such as which Adobe ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page or in which app they were displayed.
==========
The ad platforms we hire may also use technology that helps them identify devices and browsers that are being used by the same person.
We may use these ad platforms to display ads to you on non-Adobe websites or apps, which are tailored to you based on your use of our websites and apps on your various devices and browsers.
If you prefer that we do not deliver web ads to you based on how you use Adobe apps and websites, please tell us not to deliver Adobe interest-based ads to you.
If you prefer that we not deliver ads to you in non-Adobe apps based on how you use Adobe apps and websites, please set the the preference on your mobile device to limit ad tracking.
Please note that if you do set your preferences as described above, you may still see Adobe ads on other companies' websites or apps, but they will not be based on your activity on our websites and apps.
==========
Adobe complies with the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and related DAA guidance.

Adobe also runs other kinds of online ad campaigns on social networking websites and other non-Adobe websites and apps.
==========
Some of these ads may be based on information we have about users (for example, customers who have an outdated version of Adobe Photoshop may see an ad for the latest version).
These ads may also be based on information the user provided to the third-party website or app (for example, Chief Marketing Officers on LinkedIn may see an ad for Adobe Marketing Cloud analytics solutions).
If Adobe provides information to a website or app for these advertising purposes, the information may only be used to display the Adobe ad.
Please see the privacy policy of the website or app where an Adobe ad is shown for more information about its privacy practices and privacy choices it may offer.
