When you register for BusinessWeek.com, create an account on the Business Exchange, register for a BusinessWeek conference or event, or subscribe to the digital or print edition of BusinessWeek or any of our newsletters, BusinessWeek collects your personal information (including your name, address, and email address).
This information is added to our mailing list so that, from time to time, we can send you information about new features, additions, participation in market research, and changes to BusinessWeek's products and services.
Also, BusinessWeek occasionally makes personal information available to other units within Bloomberg L.P., its subsidiaries, and its affiliates ("Bloomberg") as well as to selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you.

BusinessWeek may, from time to time, use information you provide as part of the registration process to send you information regarding other products or services from Bloomberg that may be of interest to you.
BusinessWeek may provide aggregated, anonymous statistical information about BusinessWeek.com users to other persons, including potential advertising clients.
BusinessWeek may share personal information with an entity working on behalf of BusinessWeek or Bloomberg to serve customers, disclose personal information in connection with legal proceedings, investigations of crimes or other wrongdoing, and transfer personal information in conjunction with the sale or similar transfer of a business unit.
Whenever BusinessWeek permits a third party to access your personal information, commercially appropriate measures will be followed to ensure that the information is used only for authorized purposes and by authorized persons in a manner consistent with the choices customers have made under this Privacy Notice, and that the security, integrity and privacy of the information is maintained.

We use any credit card or payment information we acquire from you solely to fulfill your order.
Information collected from all BusinessWeek.com and Business Exchange registrants, as well as digital edition subscribers and US subscribers to the print edition of BusinessWeek, is stored in a secure database in the United States.
Information collected from BusinessWeek subscribers located outside of the US is stored in a secure database in the United Kingdom.
Access to both databases is limited to authorized persons.
From time to time, we may also share your information with outside vendors who will be authorized to use this information solely to perform services (such as a "mailing" house) on our behalf.
Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Notice may involve the transfer of your personal information to various countries around the world that may have different levels of privacy protection than your country.

Users of the Business Exchange may choose to create a public user profile.

Users of the Business Exchange may elect to keep their entire profile, including these elements, private.
