Information about cookies
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's server and is stored on your device's hard drive.
Each website or third party service provider used by the website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website or third party service provider to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third party service providers.
A cookie will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers.
It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket.
==========
What is a browser?
A browser is an application that allows you to surf the internet.
The most common browsers are Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari.
==========
Most browsers are secure and offer quick and easy ways to delete information like cookies.

What do cookies do?
Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests.
Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse your use of our sites and help us to provide you with a better user experience.
==========
For example, you may choose to personalise the content of a website in order to see the latest news and weather for your region.
In order to do this, a cookie is placed on your device to remember where you live so that we deliver the information that has been requested by you.
This is a prime example of how cookies are used to improve your experience of a website.
==========
Change your Browser Settings
You can choose how cookies are handled by your device via your browser settings.
The most popular browsers allow users to a) accept all cookies, b) to notify you when a cookie is issued, or c) to not receive cookies at any time.
If you choose not to receive cookies at any time, the website may not function properly and certain services will not be provided, spoiling your experience of the website.
Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
Types of Cookie
First Party Cookies
First party cookies are set by the website you are visiting and they can only be read by that site.
Third Party Cookies
Third party cookies are set by other organisations that we use for different services.
For example, Lonely Planet uses external analytics services and these suppliers may set cookies on Lonely Planet’s behalf in order to report what’s popular and what’s not.
==========
The website you are visiting may also contain content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr and these sites may set their own cookies.
Session Cookies
Session Cookies are stored only for the duration of your visit to a website and these are deleted from your device when your browsing session ends.

Flash cookies
Many websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video and game content to their users.
Adobe utilise their own cookies, which are not manageable through your browser settings but are used by the Flash Player for similar purposes, such as storing preferences or tracking users.
Flash Cookies work in a different way to web browser cookies; rather than having individual cookies for particular jobs, a website is restricted to storing all data in one cookie.

You can manage which websites can store information in Flash cookies on your device via the website storage settings panel on the Adobe website.

They may also be used to target any advertising being served on the web page you are viewing.
A web beacon (or similar) usually takes the form of a small, transparent image, which is embedded in a web page or an email.
They are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when you viewed the page or email, from what device and your (broad) location.

We use cookies to enhance the functionality of the website by storing your preferences, for example.

They gather information regarding the visitors to Lonely Planet on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website.

==========
Our sites contain advertising.
Cookies may sometimes be used to deliver advertising and marketing messages relevant to you – a practice across the internet and known as behavioural marketing.
Please see the section below called: What is Behavioural Marketing?
What is Behavioural Marketing?
==========
Behavioural Marketing technology gives users and advertisers a more valuable and unique experience by delivering advertising and content that is more relevant to the user.
The system we are using is a type of "onsite behavioural marketing" which uses cookies to discover general information about which pages on our sites you visit.
It also looks at IP addresses to add general information about the country, city or region in which you are located, along with your domain name (e.g. what internet service provider you use).
==========
This information enables you to be grouped with other people of similar interests and places you in a "market segment".
We may then display advertisements on the sites which we believe people in your market segment will find relevant.
We consider that this makes the advertising more interesting and useful to you, and also helps us increase the value we get out of the sites and from our advertisers, and therefore ultimately gives us a greater ability to invest in great content for the benefit of all our users.
It is important to note that at no time will we or our service providers attempt to identify you individually, and at no time do we know who you are or what pages you individually have been looking at - we simply aggregate the relevant information to create the market segments of groups of people.
==========
We will at all times seek to comply with the regulatory framework applicable to onsite behavioural targeting technology in our implementation of it.
Our "onsite behavioural marketing" functionality is different from other forms of behavioural targeting in that we only look at your journey across our website.
We do not use or share data with any other websites.
