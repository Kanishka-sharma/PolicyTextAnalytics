Interest Based Advertising
Target participates in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as Online Behavioral Advertising.
We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.
We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications.
This information is used to serve ads for Target products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites.
==========
These companies use non-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information.

Target adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for IBA.
Cookies, Tracking, and Interest Based Advertising
The help function of your browser should contain instructions on how to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued or to not receive cookies at any time.
If you set your device to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our features.
==========
To opt-out of the vendors we use for cross-device linking, go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page at www.aboutads.info/choices and perform a global opt-out on each browser and device that you would like to be opted out on.
Opting out in this manner means that the browser on the device from which you opt-out will no longer receive information collected on devices linked to it, that devices linked to it will not receive information collected from the opted-out device, and that the vendor will not transfer information collected from the opted-out device to a third party.
Please note that this will not opt you out of cross-device linking or advertising across linked devices based solely on your visits to Target websites or apps, or your interaction with advertisements for Target delivered by Target.
To opt-out of our interest-based advertising for Target’s goods and services or those of another party, online and in third-party mobile applications, visit Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page at here and perform a global opt-out.
Options you select are browser and device specific.
To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website.
==========
The opt-out tool described above is Cookie-based.
Therefore, the opt-out will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies, and it may not function where cookies are automatically disabled or removed.
If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again
Do Not Track
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt-out of interest based advertising (see above for opt-out information).

Other Web Site Analytics Services
Analytics services such as Site Catalyst by Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and Crazy Egg provide services that analyze information regarding visits to our websites and mobile applications.
They use cookies, web beacons, recorded interactions and other tracking mechanisms to collect this information.
