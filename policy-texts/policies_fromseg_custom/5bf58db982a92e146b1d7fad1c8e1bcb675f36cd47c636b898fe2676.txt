HOW WILL BBCW USE THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT ABOUT ME?
BBCW will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:

for service administration purposes, which means that BBCW may contact you for reasons related to the 
		    service you have signed up for, as set out in section 5: When will BBCW contact me?
below 
		    (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been 
		    suspended for maintenance);
to notify you of changes to our service;
to contact you about a submission you have made to our websites or other publications, 
		    including any content you provide (follow the link to our Code of Conduct at the bottom of the 
		    main pages of our websites for more details about making online submissions);
to personalise or improve the way BBCW content and advertising is presented to you online: 
		        
BBCW may collect your IP address (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a 
		            specific computer or other network device on the internet) and place cookies (see our Cookies Policy) 
		            for the purpose of improving our sites and enhancing your user experience, sometimes including the 
		            display of selected ads which are appropriate to your browsing pattern.
This information is not 
		            used to develop a personal profile of you;
IP addresses may also be used to identify the location of users, the number of visits from 
		            different countries and also to block disruptive use;
to analyse and improve the services offered by a BBCW website, e.g. to provide you with 
		            the most user-friendly navigation experience;


to manage our competitions and contact the winners;
to meet product orders or requests for services or information; to process payments; 
		    and to keep our records up to date;
where you have specifically consented to be contacted for these purposes, to send you direct 
		    marketing by telephone, post or email about special offers and current or new products that you 
		    may be interested in;
to enable other people or businesses to carry out work on our behalf; and
where you have given us your permission, to pass your information to carefully selected 
		    organisations to allow them to tell you about their special offers or products and services that 
		    may be of interest to you.
Where BBCW proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that 
		    we notify you first.
You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent 
		    for your use other than as listed above.

WILL BBCW SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANYONE ELSE?
Generally, we will only use your information within the BBC Worldwide Group of companies 
		 (including BBC Worldwide Group companies which are situated outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), 
		 such as Lonely Planet, which is based in Australia) in order to provide the service/product you have 
		 requested.
We will not pass your information to other members of the BBC Worldwide Group for marketing 
		 purposes unless you have consented to this.

We will only disclose your data to third party data processors with your consent or where we need to do 
		 so in order to provide a service.
The data processors to whom we may pass your data will be BBC Worldwide Group 
		 companies and appropriately contracted third parties.
Otherwise, we will keep your information confidential 
		 except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) 
		 or as described in section 7: Offensive or inappropriate content on BBCW's websites below.
BBCW will require all third party data processors to whom your information is disclosed to comply strictly 
		 with its instructions and BBCW will require that they do not use your personal information for their own 
		 business purposes.
Where we share your information with BBC Worldwide Group and third party companies which are situated outside the EEA we will 
		 ensure they treat your information with the same protection we do.

OFFENSIVE OR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT ON BBCW'S WEBSITES
If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on a BBCW website, or 
	    otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour, BBCW may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.
Where BBCW reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of the law (e.g. because content you have posted may 
		be defamatory), BBCW may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, 
		school e-mail/Internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

If you wish to cancel your registration with any of BBCW's websites, you may do so by following the "unsubscribe" 
		instructions on the relevant website.
If you change your profile to opt-out of receiving communications, 
		your record may stay on the system so we can ensure that we do not contact you in the future.
Where you contribute to a BBCW service or website, BBCW will generally only keep your content for as long 
		as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.
