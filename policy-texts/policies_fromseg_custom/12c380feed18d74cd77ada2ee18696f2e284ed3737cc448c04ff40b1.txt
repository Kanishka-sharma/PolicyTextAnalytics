This Privacy Policy explains how OpenX Software Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“OpenX”, “we” or “our”) collect, use, and disclose information, and your choices for managing your information preferences.
Key Points
We operate one of the world’s largest independent advertising exchanges, enabling websites, apps and advertisers to market, sell and buy digital and mobile ad space.
If you visit one of the websites or apps that we work with, we may collect, process and share data about you or your device with advertisers so they can determine whether to show you an ad.
The data collected and shared about you allows our advertising partners to show you ads they believe will be relevant to you.
This information is limited to device identifiers and other identifiers consisting of a random series of letters and numbers.
We don’t have your name, contact information or any other information that directly identifies you as an individual.
==========
You have rights and choices with respect to how we collect and use your data.
Learn more in the sections of this Privacy Policy entitled “Interest-Based Advertising and Opting-Out.”
California residents can learn more about their rights, including how to ask us not to sell their information, under the California Privacy Notice section of this Privacy Policy.
==========
Please read this entire policy for further detail.
What This Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes OpenX’s data practices when you:
visit a website or app that uses the OpenX services (“Services”)
visit our corporate website (www.openx.com);
provide OpenX with your information to register for the Services; or
otherwise interact with the Services.
This Privacy Policy also describes the choices that OpenX provides in connection with our collection and use of your information.
==========
OpenX receives data from website and app publisher customers and ad networks (“Publishers”), advertising demand partners (e.g. demand side platforms, advertising agencies and brands), (“Demand Partners”), service providers and consumer data resellers.
You should note that Publishers, Demand Partners and other partners may also have their own policies that govern how they collect, use, and share data.
These policies may differ from OpenX’s policies described in this Privacy Policy.
In particular, you should consult the privacy policies of the websites you visit and apps you use to become familiar with their privacy practices and to learn about any choices that these companies may offer with respect to their information practices.
Finally, the OpenX website may contain links to websites or content operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control.
We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.
Data Practices for the Services
Background Regarding the Services
Our Services help Publishers make money through advertising, and Demand Partners reach the consumers they’re interested in targeting.
The Services include our Ad Exchange, a web-based marketplace that enables Publishers and Demand Partners to efficiently market, buy and sell digital and mobile advertising inventory (the “Ad Exchange”).
Information We Collect through the Services
We collect information through Publishers that use our Services.
For example, when you visit a website or app and the Publisher sends us a request to show you an ad, we collect certain information about the ad space, you and your device to help inform a Demand Partner’s decision to serve the ad.
We also collect information through Demand Partners that use our Services, as well as from other third-party partners.
==========
This information we collect can identify your device over time.
We do not know your name or contact information, or any other information that would directly identify you as an individual.
However, this information may still be considered “personal data” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy or data protection laws.
In particular, we may collect the following categories of information:
Unique online identifiers (e.g. IP address, cookies, mobile advertising identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID)
Information about your  browsing behavior on a Publisher’s website or app (e.g. domain or app store URL or bundle ID, category code associated with website or app, referring website address, date/time of visit, ‘click through’ data) 
Browser information (e.g. browser type, version, language,)
Device information (e.g. screen dimensions, device brand and model)
Internet service information (e.g. Internet Service Provider used by you)
Derived location data (as derived from IP address or GPS (for mobile))
Precise location data (if you have enabled location services on your device and a Publisher passes that data to us)
Ad reporting or delivery data (e.g. size/type of ad, ad impressions, location/format of ad, data about interactions with the ad)
Interest segments (i.e. inferred information on the behavior or likely interests associated with you)
Retargeting data (i.e. data indicating previous interest in a product or website)
Other data that can be passed in the request to the Demand Partner to inform their decision (a non-exhaustive list of fields can be found at https://docs.openx.com/Content/publishers/s2s-openrtb-bidrequests.html).
We primarily recognize your devices through the following identifiers:
Cookies and Similar Technologies – We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser), Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage), pixels, etags, and similar technologies to collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests.
==========
These technologies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
They remember the websites you visit and that information is shared with other parties such as Demand Partners.
Please see our Interest-Based Advertising section below for information about your choices regarding our use of these technologies for interest-based advertising.
==========
Mobile Advertising IDs – We and our partners use standard mobile advertising identifiers, for example the “IDFA” advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” advertising identifier used on Android devices, to track your use of mobile apps on your device(s).
Publishers, Demand Partners, and third party data partners may also utilize cookies or similar technologies.
The collection of information through cookies or similar technologies by such third parties will be governed by their own privacy policies and principles, which OpenX does not control.
Your browser may offer tools to enable or disable cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.
To read about your choices with regard to OpenX’s use of cookies in our Services, please see the “Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out” section of this Privacy Policy.
==========
How We Use the Information We Collect through the Services
We pass data we collect from ad requests Publishers send to the Ad Exchange to Demand Partners so that they can decide whether to show you an ad and send you more relevant ads.
From certain ad request data received from Publishers, we derive additional information that we include in the request sent to Demand Partners.
For example, from an IP address, we can derive certain general location information you like city and state.
==========
We may also add additional data we have collected from other sources to inform the Demand Partner’s bid and improve the relevance of the advertising.
We also use the information we collect to host, operate, maintain, secure, and further develop and improve our Services, such as to keep track of advertising delivery, to measure the effectiveness of advertising delivered through our Services, and to investigate compliance with OpenX’s policies and terms and conditions.
How We Share Data Collected by the Services
We may disclose the information that our Services collect about you in the following ways:
Ad Transactions – We pass data to Demand Partners so that they can combine this information with other information they have independently collected to determine whether to show you an ad.
Business Transfers – we may share the data we collect in connection with an actual or proposed sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets, corporate merger, consolidation, or bankruptcy.
==========
Compliance with Regulatory Authorities and Laws – we may share the data we collect with law enforcement, regulatory authorities, courts with competent jurisdictions, emergency services or other necessary third parties for legal, protection, security and safety purposes, including: 
To comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests and legal process;
 To protect the rights and property of OpenX, our agents, customers, and others, including enforcing out agreements, policies, and terms of use and protecting our network and physical assets; and/or
To protect the safety of our employees and agents, or partners, or any person.
Service Providers – We share the relevant data we collect with our partners who perform functions on our or our clients’ behalf.
Examples include: analyzing data; cross-device linking; fraud prevention; and hosting data.
==========
Data Practices for OpenX Website and Customer-Provided Information
Information the OpenX Website Collects
OpenX collects contact information through our website when you choose to provide it, such as your name, username, or email address.
For example, you may be asked to provide us with contact information when you register with the OpenX website and when you use the Services.
The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the OpenX website.
In order to make payments owed to Publishers or collect payments from Demand Partners, OpenX may also request additional information from Publishers and Demand Partners such as other contact information and billing account information.

where we believe it is necessary to protect OpenX or our users; to enforce our terms or the legal rights of OpenX or others; or to comply with a request from governmental authorities, legal process, or other legal obligations; orwhere we contract with third parties to provide certain services, such as advertising, analytics, data management services, web hosting, and web development (“Vendors”).
We ask Vendors to confirm that their privacy and security practices are consistent with ours, we provide our Vendors with only the information necessary for them to perform the services we request, and Vendors are prohibited from using such information for purposes other than as specified by OpenX.

Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out
OpenX adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles in the US and to the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Principles in the European Union (“EU”) and the IAB Europe OBA Framework.
==========
As discussed above, the Services use cookies, Web beacons, pixels, etags, and similar technologies to give Publishers the possibility to offer, and Demand Partners the ability to show, targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a different device.
These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use data collected across non-affiliated apps over time.
This is called “interest-based advertising.”
==========
When we identify possible relationships among different browsers and devices, this is called “cross-device linking.”
In addition, certain third parties may collect data on the OpenX website and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include interest-based advertising.
Opting Out for Cookie-Based Services: If you would like to learn more about this type of advertising, or would prefer to opt out of website interest-based advertising enabled by the Services, European Economic Area (“EEA”) individuals may opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the EDAA at www.youronlinechoices.com and all other users may visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program.
==========
Please note that in order for your opt-out choice to be effective using this tool, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the OpenX opt-out cookie.
Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, and you may need to change your browser settings to accept third-party cookies before opting out.
Opting Out for Certain Non-Cookie Services (in applicable countries): To help identify your browser and/or possible relationships between different browsers and devices, OpenX or our partners may use the local storage or cache in your browser.
Using the browser cache or local storage helps OpenX or our partners deliver interest-based advertising to a browser without the use of third-party cookies.
To opt out of OpenX’s use of local storage or the browser cache to provide its services, please (1) use any tools provided by your browser to clear local storage and the browser cache, and (2) turn on any “Do Not Track” header setting offered by your browser.
As long as the two steps are completed and maintained on a browser, OpenX will not use local storage or the cache on that browser to identify and sync browsers and devices.
==========
If you also want to opt out of OpenX’s use of third-party cookies for interest-based advertising enabled by OpenX’s Ad Exchange, please see instructions above.
Opting Out for Mobile Application Data: To opt out of OpenX’s collection, use, and transfer of data for interest-based advertising on mobile apps, you may download the DAA’s AppChoices application from the Android or iOS app store on your mobile device.
Users outside the United States may not have access to this application; instead, you can use “Limit Ad Tracking” in your iOS settings or “Opt out of interest-based ads” in your Android settings to limit OpenX’s collection of data for interest-based advertising.
Opting Out for Location Data: You may opt out of our collection, use, and transfer of precise location data by using the location services controls in your mobile device’s settings.
Opting Out for Television & Internet Connected Device Data: Your Internet connected device (e.g. smart TV or a set up box) may give you the ability to opt out of the use of information for advertising purposes.
To determine if your device has these options, please visit your device’s setting menus.
Effect of Opting Out: If you use a different device or browser, or erase cookies from your browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
==========
If you opt out of OpenX’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.
Publishers and Demand Partners that participate in the Ad Exchange may also use their own cookies and other ad service technologies to display and track their ads.
We do not control and are not responsible for such Publishers’ and Demand Partners’ information practices or their use of cookies and other ad service technologies.
To learn more about the practices of these companies, please read their privacy policies.
Even if you opt-out, OpenX may continue to collect data for other purposes and you still may receive advertising from the Ad Exchange when you visit websites of a Publisher who uses our Services – but such advertising will not be targeted to you.
==========
Reviewing and Updating Information
OpenX takes reasonable steps to ensure that information is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.
For contact or billing information submitted through our website, you may review, correct, update, or change your information, request that we deactivate your account, or remove your information from our direct marketing efforts, at any time by e-mailing us at privacy@openx.com.
