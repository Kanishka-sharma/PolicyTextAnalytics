However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals, in part because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators, nor is there a consistent standard of interpreting user intent.

==========
As part of a global group of companies operating internationally, SAP has affiliates (the “SAP Group”) and third-party service providers outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and will transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the EEA.
If these transfers are to a country for which the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, SAP uses the EU standard contractual clauses to contractually require that your Personal Data receives a level of data protection consistent with the EEA.
You can obtain a copy (redacted to remove commercial or irrelevant) of such standard contractual clauses by sending a request to privacy@sap.com.
You can also obtain more information from the European Commission on the international dimension of data protection here: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_fr
What are your data protection rights?
==========
You can request from SAP: access at any time to information about which Personal Data SAP processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data.
Please note, however, that SAP can or will delete your Personal Data only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of SAP to retain it.
Kindly note further that if you request that SAP deletes your Personal Data, you will not be able to continue to use any SAP service that requires SAP’s use of your Personal Data.
If SAP uses your Personal Data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you can further request from SAP a copy of the Personal Data that you have provided to SAP.
In this case, please contact privacy@sap.com and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the format in which you would like to receive this information, and whether the Personal Data should be sent to you or another recipient.
SAP will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how it can best fulfill it.
==========
Furthermore, you can request from SAP that SAP restricts your Personal Data from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Data SAP has about you is incorrect, subject to the time SAP requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Data, (ii) there is no legal basis for SAP processing your Personal Data and you demand that SAP restricts your Personal Data from further processing, (iii) SAP no longer requires your Personal Data but you state that you require SAP to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims, or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by SAP based on SAP’s legitimate interest (as further set out below), subject to the time required for SAP to determine whether it has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Data.

to request from SAP access to your Personal Data that SAP collects, uses, discloses, or sells (if applicable) about you;
to request that SAP delete Personal Data about you;
to opt-out of the sale of Personal Data, if applicable;
to non-discriminatory treatment for exercise of any of your data protection rights
in case of request from SAP for access to your Personal Data, for such information to be portable, if possible, in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit this information to another recipient without hindrance.

How can you exercise your data protection rights?

You can also designate another person to submit requests to exercise your data protection rights to SAP.
You can give authorization to such person by granting them a limited power of attorney to exercise your data protection rights on your behalf.
==========
How will SAP verify requests to exercise data protection rights?
SAP will take steps to ensure that it verifies your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty before it will process the data protection right you want to exercise.
When feasible, SAP will match Personal Data provided by you in submitting a request to exercise your rights with information already maintained by SAP.
This could include matching two or more data points you provide when you submit a request with two or more data points that are already maintained by us.
==========
In accordance with the verification process set forth in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), SAP will require a more stringent verification process for deletion requests, or for Personal Data that is considered sensitive or valuable, to minimize the harm that might be posed to you by unauthorized access or deletion of your Personal Data.
If SAP must request additional information from you outside of information that is already maintained by SAP, SAP will only use it for the purposes of verifying your identity so you can exercise your data protection rights, or for security and fraud-prevention purposes.
SAP will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required by local law.
If you take the view that SAP is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements in this Privacy Statement or under applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country where you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state where SAP has its registered seat.

How does SAP use cookies?
Our Site uses cookies and/or other similar technologies to enhance & customize your user experience.
Cookies are small text files placed on your device that enable us to remember your device, and which can be used to manage a range of features and content as well as storing searches and presenting personalized content.
==========
We use this information to ensure the proper functioning and security of our Site and Services and to optimize our Site or Services.
How do we collect cookies and other technologies 
This section describes our practices with respect to how we use cookies.
By using our Services with your browser set to accept cookies, you are consenting to our use of cookies in the manner described herein.
We may collect data about your use of the Services through the use of cookies, Internet server logs, tracking pixels (also called web beacons) and similar technologies.
==========
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, that enables us to recognize your computer/device, store your preferences and settings, enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform searches and analytics, and assist with security administrative functions.
An Internet server log is a file where website activity is stored.
Server logs are used to track usage and provide security.
==========
A tracking pixel, which is also referred to as a web beacon or a clear GIF, is an electronic tag with a unique identifier that is embedded on webpages, in online advertisements and/or email.
These pixels are designed to provide usage information, such as advertising impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and access user cookies.
What types of cookies do we use?
Third party cookies
We use third parties to assist us in advertising, tracking aggregated and/or de-identified site usage statistics, and providing content-sharing services to support the Services.
These third parties may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect similar information about your use of the Services.
For instance, the cookies may reflect de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., a hashed version of your email address, which we may share with service providers, solely in non-human readable form.
We do not control these third-party technologies, and their use is governed by those parties’ privacy policies.
We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site or use the Services.

A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie.
We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time.
For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.
Another type of cookies is Flash cookies, which are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files and help in the viewing of content that uses the Adobe Flash player.
