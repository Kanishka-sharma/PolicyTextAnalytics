Other activities on our site require you to be registered-for example, to request a demo.
As part of the registration process, we ask you to provide additional personal information.
We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products, seminars and services if you so request; to fulfill your request; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records; or to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys.
Disclosure of Personal Information
In some instances we rely on our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about Webtrends and its solutions.
To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
We sometimes hire vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations.
==========
In addition, we may use third party information or technology in our products and disclose customer information to such third parties solely for the purposes of fulfillment, support, or audit by such third parties.
We may also license/transfer or sell-off our technology to third parties, and in connection with such transitions, we may disclose customer data to the transferee.
If you require further information on the channel partners, vendor companies or third parties to whom your information may have been passed to please contact privacy@webtrends.com.
Because we have a global presence, your personal information may be shared with other offices or subsidiaries within Webtrends Inc. in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere.
The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less extensive than laws in the country in which you are located.
However, all offices of Webtrends Inc. are governed by this Privacy Policy and will use your personal information only as set forth in this policy.
