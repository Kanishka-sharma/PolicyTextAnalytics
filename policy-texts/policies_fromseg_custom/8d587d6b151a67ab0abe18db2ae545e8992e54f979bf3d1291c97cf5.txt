==========
What Information We Collect And What We Use It For
Personally Identifiable Information
We collect Personally identifiable information (“PII”) in connection with the Site.
PII is information that can be used to identify an individual User, for example, a person’s name, home address, email address, or phone number.
We receive and store any PII Users enter on our Site, send to us in an email or voluntarily provide to us in any other way.
Registering to become a customer of the Intent Media network (our “Clients”), either as an advertiser or a publisher, requires the submission of PII to our company, including name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, website URL, credit card and/or other payment information.
==========
We use this information to service accounts and respond to inquiries.
We will only use the contact information of Clients for communications related to the network.
Registered Clients may reach us through the “Contact Us” links on our Site to update or correct their personal information.
==========
Intent Media does not collect PII from Users in connection with the Service.
Users should be aware, however, that Intent Media’s Clients may request such information from Users in order to use their websites or e-commerce systems.
Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the websites they visit to assess the security of any PII they disclose.
==========
Sensitive Information
Intent Media does not collect any of the following data in connection with the Service: social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers; insurance plan numbers; financial account numbers; information that describes the real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices (though we do collect IP addresses, which can provide approximate geographic location); or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic, and family medical history.
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
Intent Media collects non-personally identifiable information via the Site.
Non-personally identifiable information is information that generally can’t be used by us to identify you personally.
We also collect non-personally identifiable data in connection with our Service and we sometimes enable other third-parties to collect information in connection with our Service.
In order to customize the online user experience and provide our Clients with useful statistics and analysis regarding their websites and advertisements, Intent Media may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, which we do not link to PII, including but not limited to a User’s purchasing intent, usage information, transaction information, IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.
Data Integrity
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
How Collected Information Is Used
The non-personally identifiable data that Intent Media or its third party advertising technology vendors collect are used for to better target advertisements to people across the different websites they visit.
==========
The data may also be used to predict responses to advertisements, to help determine which ads perform best and to evaluate which advertisements are most appropriate for a given User.
In addition, we may use the data to analyze trends, administer the Site and the Service, customize the advertising and content Users may see, track Users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We may use different types of technology, including cookies and data tags (see more information below), to collect such anonymous information and target the most relevant ads to Users based on such information.
Data may also be combined with non-personally identifiable information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to consumers’ preferences and behaviors, and for other Intent Media sales and marketing efforts.
If a User voluntarily provides Intent Media with PII in an email or by completing an online form, we will use that PII only to contact such User to respond to such User’s inquiry.
==========
Sharing with Third Parties, Onward Transfer
We may employ third party companies and individuals to process payments, to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform operational services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Service’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
These third parties may have access to information we’ve collected but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
We may also provide the information of Clients to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing the Service.
==========
Intent Media may share aggregate information about Clients and Users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.
Intent Media may share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties for the purpose of allowing those entities to better target advertising.
We do not use information about health-related topics to target ads to Users.
Intent Media may disclose any information in our systems if we believe that doing so is legally required or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of other persons, entities, facilities, equipment or the Service.
We may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we will provide a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of information, as well as any choices we may offer regarding the information in our systems.
==========
User Segmentation
We may also use the data that we collect to aggregate groups of Users, referred to as “segments,” based upon their behavior.
We may give our Clients a limited right to use segments as a basis for targeting and displaying advertisements and other content that are intended to reflect the intents and interests of Users associated with a given segment.
Cookies and other Targeting Technologies
Intent Media employs “cookies” and web beacons in connection with providing the Site and the Service.
Cookies are small packets of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier, that are sent to a User’s browser from a website’s computer and stored on the User’s computer’s hard drive.
The website placing the cookie on the User’s computer can then recognize the computer when the User navigates the website at a later time.
For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Intent Media may also use statistical IDs in connection with the Service.
Statistical IDs are derived from information collected from your computer or device, such as your devices’ IP address, user agent string and types of fonts installed on your computer or device.
They don’t install software or leave anything permanently on your computer or device.
Intent Media may use cookies, web beacons, JavaScript and statistical IDs for the purposes of helping us better understand when an Internet User has seen or clicked on an advertisement.
==========
These technologies will help us tailor advertising messages served via the Service, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
To make certain that advertisements are correctly targeted to Users, our Clients may also place data tags on their websites.
Data tags are used to match anonymous visitor browsing behavior to specified advertisements.
==========
Users always have the option to prevent the use of cookies on their computers by changing the setting on their Internet browsers to block cookies.
In addition, Users have the option to block the use of JavaScript, which may be used by Intent Media to display advertisements.
Controlling cookies and JavaScript may not have an impact on our use of Statistical IDs.
Since each Internet browser is different, for more information, each User should review the documentation regarding the User’s specific browser.
User’s are encouraged to review their privacy choices below under the section entitled “Choice / Opt-out.”
Users should be aware, however, that blocking the use of cookies or JavaScript may affect the User’s ability to access the functionality and content of certain websites.
==========
Data Retention
The cookies we set in connection with the Service expire after no more than two years, and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.
Only our opt-out cookie (see below) has a different expiration date.
We retain our web log data for no more than three years.
Within three years, all original data is deleted or anonymized.
Aggregated data may be stored indefinitely.
==========
Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use.
This also includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption.
Any data that is stored on Intent Media’s servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public.
Intent Media has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs.
==========
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Please send questions about security on our Site to privacy@intentmedia.com.
==========
Choice / Opt-out
If you’d like to opt out from having Intent Media use your information in connection with the Service, please click here.
When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer, which tells our Service not to use your data to target advertisements on your computer.
Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
==========
Access to Information
Intent Media will allow an individual access to their PII to the extent it is available and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
Intent Media allows each Client to access the following information about such Client for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that information.
This list may change as Intent Media’s Site and Service change.
Real name
Account and user profile information
Credit card and/or other payment information
User e-mail address
User phone number
Username and password
Third-Party Sites
Intent Media’s Site or Service may permit Users to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site.
==========
These other websites are not under Intent Media’s control and Intent Media is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.
Children’s Privacy
Intent Media is very sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy.
Intent Media’s Site and Service are neither developed for, nor directed at, children.
If you believe your child has provided Intent Media with personally identifiable data, or registered at one of Intent Media’s Client websites, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
Intent Media may find it necessary to update this privacy policy from time to time.
We will conspicuously note any material changes and post the changes in this privacy policy on our Site.
