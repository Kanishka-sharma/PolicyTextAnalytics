Depending on the respective application (see above), cookies and similar technologies are used to identify users.
Cookies: 
		Cookies are small text files that contain a character string that can be used to uniquely identify a web browser or WebApp installation.
Operators of websites and web apps or third parties store cookies on computers or mobile devices when they are used.
==========
Cookies usually expire after a certain period of time and are therefore automatically deleted.

==========
Local Storage: 
		Local Storage stands for a technology that enables websites and web apps to save data on your computer or mobile device in the context of the browser.
While this is similar to cookies, the local storage can hold larger amounts of data; however, its content is not transmitted to the web server with every request, but must be read out explicitly.
Furthermore, the data is retained in the Locale Storage until the application or the user deletes it himself.
For information on handling the local storage, please refer to the help pages or the documentation for your web browser.
SENSIC.net uses local storage entries named "sui" with a validity of 2 years.
File Cache: 
		File Cache stands for a technology that enables websites and web apps to save data on your computer or mobile device so that websites can be loaded more quickly the next time you visit them.
The data is automatically deleted after the expiry date.
For information on handling the file cache, please refer to the help pages or the documentation for your browser.
==========
SENSIC.net uses the file cache via the URL "sui-fc.
sensic.net" with a validity of 2 years.
==========
App Cache: 
		App Cache stands for a technology that enables native apps to save data on your mobile device.
While this is similar to the file cache, the data is retained in the app cache until the application or the user deletes it himself.
For information on handling the App Cache, please refer to the help pages or the documentation for your mobile device.
SENSIC.net uses the app cache entries named "sui" and "sui_ac" with a validity of 2 years.
==========
Mobile advertising ID: 
		The mobile advertising ID is an online identifier for a mobile device that you can reset manually.
It enables recurring devices to be recognized by mobile apps, usually for advertising purposes.
For Android devices, the mobile advertising ID is called “Android Advertising ID”, for Apple devices it is called “ID for Advertiser (IDFA)”.
The mobile advertising ID is associated with a device and can be accessed by apps that you use.
For information on handling the mobile advertising ID, please refer to the help pages or the documentation for your mobile operating system.
Relay ID mechanism: 
		The relay ID mechanism is a process that transfers the stored or temporary user ID to additional panel software or hardware.
==========
The mechanism therefore only works for users who have installed such panel software or hardware (e.g. DigitalTrends, Wakoopa Tracker, GfK Router, MyScan, GfK Influencers, Nicequest), i.e. only for participants in selected market research panels and other market research projects.

We anonymize this data by shortening and hashing IP addresses and cutting off the entire part after the “top-level domain” from each referrer URL, for example everything after “.com” or “.
de”.
Before we save IP addresses anonymously, we use them to determine in which country and in which region or city the respective usage process took place.

==========
External serviceprovider:
		If necessary, we commission other companies and persons to carry out certain tasks that contribute to our services within the framework of order processing agreements.

Companies of the GfK Group: 
		Internal data protection agreements exist with companies of the GfK Group outside the European Union based on standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission to protect your privacy and to legitimize international data transfers.
Other third parties outside the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA): 
		Any transfer of personal data to third parties outside the GfK Group will only take place with your knowledge and, where applicable, with your prior consent.
Any transfer of personal data to countries for which there is no adequacy decision with regard to the level of data protection from the European Commission, such as at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension -data-protection / adequacy-decisions_en, is made on the basis of contractual agreements that contain the standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission or other guarantees that comply with applicable law.
GfK takes data security very seriously.
We take all necessary physical, electronic and administrative security measures to protect the data, including personal data, that we collect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration and unlawful disclosure, as well as unauthorized access to transferred, stored or otherwise processed personal data to prevent.

We reserve the right to change our data protection practices at our own discretion and to update and change this data protection declaration at any time.
For this reason, we ask you to regularly check the data protection declaration available at https://sensic.net/ for changes.
==========
This data protection declaration applies from the date of the "last revision" mentioned above.
We treat your personal data in accordance with the data protection declaration under which it was collected, unless we have your consent to other handling of your personal data.
