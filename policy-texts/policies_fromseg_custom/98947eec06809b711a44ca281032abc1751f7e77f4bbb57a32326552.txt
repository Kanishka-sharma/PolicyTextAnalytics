We will ask at that time whether the individual wishes to view their medical report, and we will notify their doctor of that request.
They will have 21 days from providing their consent in which to arrange to view the medical report and discuss it with their doctor.
If they believe the medical report is inaccurate, they can request that their doctor amend the report.
If the doctor refuses to amend the report, the individual can require that a statement of their view is attached to the report.
