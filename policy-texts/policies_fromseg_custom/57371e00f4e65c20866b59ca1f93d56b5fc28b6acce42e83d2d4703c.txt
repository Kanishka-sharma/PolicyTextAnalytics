This Cookie Policy describes how and why Whois Digital Pte Ltd 
              (“we”, “us” or “Whois.com”) use cookies,
              web beacons, pixels, tags, scripts and other similar technologies in the
              course of our business, including through websites and apps that link to
              this Cookie Policy.
For additional information about our privacy
              practices, please review our Privacy
              Policy.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or other
              internet-enabled device that enable our features and functionality.
==========
They
              allow us to record information when you visit or interact with our
              websites, products and services (collectively, our “Websites”).
Other
              tracking technologies, such as web beacons and pixels work similarly to
              cookies, placing small data files on your device that monitor your Website
              activity.
How do we use cookies?
We use cookies and other tracking technologies to make our Websites
              easier to use and to better tailor them to your interests and needs.
We also
              use these technologies to compile anonymous, aggregated information that
              allow us to better understand our customers and visitors.
==========
What kinds of cookies and tracking technologies do we use?
Persistent and Session Cookies
We use two categories of cookies: Persistent cookies and session
              cookies.
Persistent cookies are cookies that help us
              recognize you.
They are stored on your device in between browser sessions,
              allowing us to remember your preferences and actions across multiple sites
              and on multiple visits.
Session cookies expire at the end
              of your browser session, allowing us to link your actions during a
              particular browsing session.
Google Analytics
We use first party Google Analytics cookies to track anonymous usage
              statistics and do not collect any personal information that can be used to
              identify you.
This helps us analyse data about website usage and improve
              our Websites in order to tailor it to customer needs.
We do not allow
              Google to use or share our analytics data.
==========
Third Party Cookies
Third party cookies are cookies that are set by others,
              enabling the third party’s features or functionalities to be provided
              through the Website you are using.
The third party setting these cookies
              can recognize your device both when it visits our Website and when it
              visits certain other websites or services.
The service providers of third-party
              cookies have their own privacy policies, and may use their cookies to
              target advertising to you.
==========
YouTube
We embed videos from YouTube on our websites.
As a result, when you visit a page with content embedded from
              YouTube, you may be presented with third party cookies from YouTube.
Why do we use cookies?
We generally use cookies that are necessary or essential to the
              functioning of our Websites, cookies that help us improve the performance
              or customize the functionality of our Websites, and cookies that help us
              serve you relevant advertisements.
The types of cookies described below may
              be set by us or by a third party service provider assisting us in
              performing the below functions.
Specifically, we use cookies for the
              following reasons:

Strictly Necessary: These cookies and tracking
                technologies let you navigate our Websites and use essential features,
                including secure areas and shopping baskets.
==========
Without these technologies,
                we are unable to deliver core functionality of our Websites, products and
                services to you.
Performance: These cookies and tracking technologies
                help us understand how customers and visitors interact with our Websites.
They provide us with information about areas of our website visited, time
                spent on our Websites and any error messages you receive, allowing us to
                improve the performance of our Websites.
They do not collect any
                information that could identify you.
Functional: These cookies and tracking technologies
                are used to provide certain services or to remember settings that will
                improve your visit, but are not essential to your use of our Websites.
They may include personal information that you have disclosed to us.
==========
Social Media Cookies: These cookies are set by third
                parties, including Facebook and Twitter, and allow you to share what
                you’ve been doing on our Websites on social media.
How can I control cookies?
Internet browsers allow you to change your cookie settings via the
              “options’ or “preferences” menu in your browser.
Please note that if you
              set your browser to refuse or block all cookies, certain features or
              functionalities of our Websites will be limited or unavailable to you.
Some internet browsers include the ability to transmit “do not track”
              signals.
==========
Because no industry standard has yet been developed with respect
              to “do not track,” our Websites do not currently process or respond to such
              “do not track” signals.
You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our
              site.
For more information on opting out of being tracked by Google
              Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
