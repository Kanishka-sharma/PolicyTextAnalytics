INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Overstock is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
For most non-US transactions, we have partnered with third party companies (“Vendors”) that we have selected to help us facilitate international transactions.
We work closely with these Vendors to ensure that your transaction is handled with care and all the information you provide is secure.
In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield or the Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Overstock is potentially liable.
==========
As an international customer, when you click on the checkout button, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by a Vendor to complete your order.
On the checkout page, you will be required to select a method of payment and submit credit card and other information to such Vendor to complete your order.
On the checkout page, you will be presented with the Vendor’s terms and conditions which you must agree to in order to complete your order.
Upon completion and approval of your order by such Vendor, the Vendor will notify us of the approval and we will process your order and cause it to be shipped directly to the Vendor.
In this process, the Vendor will purchase those items in your order from us, thereby taking title to the items, bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority (if applicable), and arrange for the delivery of your order.
In this process, the Vendor makes the sale to you as the merchant of record, but we are legally obligated to deliver your order as set forth in our Terms and Conditions.
Such Vendors must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the Personal Data that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy.
If you have questions about your order, you should direct them to us and not to the Vendor.
The Vendors may give you the opportunity to receive marketing messages from them, in which case you should refer to their terms and conditions for details about how they use your information.
