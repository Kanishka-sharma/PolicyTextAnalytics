Introduction

		As part of our mission to develop the most complete searchable index of music files legally posted on the Internet for promotional and other legal purposes, our search crawler continuously crawls the Internet for new legally posted music files.
We are, however, primarily an information location tool, and we maintain no editorial oversight over the links in our search index.
We do not control the third party websites contained in our index.
==========
We are not a "file sharing" site, peer to peer or otherwise; and we in no way support or endorse illegal copying of music.
Because we do not own or have editorial control over these third party sites, it is possible that our index may link to some music files that were posted without the copyright owner's authorization.
We are a not-for-profit internet resource which is NOT generating revenue by selling or distributing Music Files, we generate advertising revenue to maintain our server and personnel costs and we pay royalties to PSOs such as BMI and ASCAP for streaming/performing music through our music player.
==========
We rely on copyright owners to protect their own copyright interests by communicating with us.
We will immediately take down the link in response to a valid notice of alleged infringement submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").
