Privacy Policy for Ask.com
Effective date: July 13, 2005

Internet privacy is an issue that Ask (“we” 
or “us”) takes very seriously.
We provide this Privacy Policy 
so that our users (“you”) will know what personally identifiable 
information is being collected about you, how that information is 
being used, and with whom it is being shared.
This Privacy Policy 
addresses these issues as well as additional issues that we believe 
may be of interest to you.
This Privacy Policy describes the online privacy 
practices for the Internet Domain Ask.com ( 
the “Sites”) and the various services (collectively, the 
“Services”) and software products (“Software”) we 
provide on or through the Sites.
By using one of the Sites, the 
Services or the Software or by providing any personally identifiable 
information using one of the Sites, Services or Software, you are 
agreeing to the collection and use of such information in the manner 
described in this Privacy Policy.
==========
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to 
time.
We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy 
to be sure you are familiar with the most current version.
The Policy 
will include the most recent date in which any revision has been 
made at the top of the page.
This Privacy Policy addresses the following issues: 
 

What types of information do we gather 
and how do we use it?
==========
How are cookies used on the Sites?
Do we use your information to deliver 
targeted ads to you?
In what other situations may we disclose 
your information?
What happens when you leave the Sites 
to go to other Internet sites?
==========
What is our policy regarding personally 
identifiable information from children under 13?
Do we take security precautions to 
protect your personal identifiable information?
Can you review, edit, or delete the 
personally identifiable information that we have collected
about you online that we maintain?
Are there special considerations if 
you are visiting the Sites from outside of the United States?
==========
Whom can you ask if you have additional 
privacy-related questions?
What types of information do we gather and how 
do we use it?
Information gathered online can generally be categorized 
as either anonymous or personally identifiable.
Anonymous information 
is information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual.
==========
For example, we know how many search queries we receive each day 
but we generally do not know the names and e-mail addresses of the 
persons submitting the queries.
Personally identifiable information 
is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with 
you, such as your name, physical mailing address, email address 
and telephone number.
Information identifying an entity other than 
an individual (e.g., a corporation, partnership, joint venture and 
so forth) does not constitute personally identifiable information 
and is treated the same as anonymous information discussed below.
Except as described below, we do not associate the anonymous 
information we gather from you, including your IP address, with 
the personally identifiable information we gather from you.
For 
this reason, we do not consider your IP address to be personally 
identifiable information (unless and until such an association is 
made, such as in response to a court order).
What Anonymous Information do we gather and 
how do we use it?
==========
We also collect anonymous information, which is any 
information that is not personally identifiable.
For example, each 
time you come to one of the Sites, we collect the limited information 
that your browser makes available whenever you visit any website.
This information includes: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; 
(b) your domain name (e.g. whether you logged on from compaq.com 
or whitehouse.gov); (c) the address of the last URL you visited 
prior to clicking through to the Site; (d) your browser and platform 
type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (e) your 
browser language; and (f) the data in any undeleted cookies that 
your browser previously accepted from us (see "How 
are cookies used on the Sites?"
below).
==========
Additionally, if you 
enter a search query through the Sites or Services, we will receive 
the query text and process it, together with the above data, to 
return a results page to you.
If you have installed our Software 
(or if you have otherwise modified your browser settings so that 
erroneous domain name system (DNS) requests are submitted to us 
as search queries), we will receive any search term or misspelled 
URL that you enter into your browser's address bar.
You can deactivate 
this feature by calling up the Software's Settings menu and unchecking 
"Make Ask.com my default search engine" under the "Options" tab.
==========
All information collected from a search query is anonymous.
In addition to collecting these types of information, 
we collect aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted 
advertising.
We also count, track, and aggregate our visitors' activities 
into our analysis of general traffic flows at the Sites (e.g. tracking 
where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Sites, whether 
a user clicks on the initial search result, etc.).
All information 
about our users' search activity is evaluated only on an anonymous 
(and generally only on an aggregated) basis, except in response 
to a customer service inquiry or legal process.
==========
If you have installed one of our search toolbars, your 
use of such Software may send the following additional information 
to us: your IP address, your browser type, your default language 
setting, an identification of any button or menu item you selected 
or activated, and the text of any Web search query you enter into 
the toolbar.
(When you use our desktop search toolbar, we do not 
receive the text of any desktop search query unless you specify 
that you also wish to run that query as a Web search).
We collect the above types of anonymous information 
to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including 
product monitoring, product improvement, targeted advertising, and 
monetizing commercially oriented search keywords.
==========
Some elements 
on the Sites, such as the sponsored links on our search results 
pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract.
In those 
cases, we may supply some or all of the above information to those 
third-parties so that they can provide those elements for display 
on the Sites.
For example, when you submit a query we may transmit 
it (and the related information described above) to our paid listing 
providers in order to obtain relevant advertising to display in 
response to your query.
We also use the anonymous data we collect 
to ensure that these third-parties are appropriately compensating 
us and that we are appropriately compensating our distributors.
We may merge information about you into group data, which may then 
be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers.
If you provide 
us with answers to voluntary survey questions, we may present this 
information to our advertisers and partners in the form of grouped 
statistics compiled from our users' answers to such questions.
==========
Our Sites, Services and Software: 

  with the exception of your domain name and the URL you 
visited prior to coming to our site, do not collect or report 
back to us  any information about other sites you visit on 
the Internet;


  do not collect or "screen-scrape" any search queries 
or information that you provide to any other web sites; 


  do not serve pop-ups or other ads when you are on other websites;  


  do not collect or report back to us any data regarding your computer keystrokes (or other data) unrelated to the services the  Sites and Software provide  



What Personally Identifiable Information do we gather and how do we use it?
Except as described below, the Sites, Services and Software do not 
collect any personally identifiable information about you.
In addition, 
we do not share your personally identifiable information 
with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to send you 
information about their products (nor for any other purpose, except 
as described in this policy).
You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information 
to use the Sites, Services or Software.
However, registration and 
full utilization of some of our Services does require that you provide 
certain personally identifiable information.
For example, some of 
the Sites and Services require that you to register for an account.
==========
We ask you for some personal information in order to create an account 
(email address and a password for your account).
Other personally 
identifiable information you might provide could include your contact 
information if you participate in a promotion or sweepstakes, your 
email address if you submit a help request to us via email or respond 
to employment opportunities posted on the Sites.
The amount of such 
personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose 
to us is completely up to you, although access to or use of some 
Services may be affected if such information is not provided.
We use your personally identifiable information to provide you personalized 
service, to ensure the smooth operation of the Sites and Services, 
to improve the Sites, Services and Software, and in connection with 
the enforcement of our Terms of Service for each Site and this Privacy 
Policy.
We also may use your personally identifiable information 
to contact you to respond to a request from you, if we believed 
we are compelled or otherwise obligated to do so as part of a legal 
proceeding, or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service.
Some of the services that we provide in connection with our Web 
site are fee-based; such service fees may be paid by you with your 
credit card.
We note that your credit card information may be disclosed 
by us to third parties in order to process or otherwise complete 
a transaction in which payment is by credit card.
==========
We note that such 
third parties may have privacy policies that differ significantly 
from this Policy.
We may use external service providers to facilitate and evaluate 
the Services.
This may require disclosure of your personally identifiable 
information to these service providers.
In some instances, the external 
service provider may collect information directly from you in connection 
with the Services.
In all cases, we seek to have commercially reasonable 
contractual safeguards in place which require these external service 
providers to use your personally identifiable information solely 
for the purpose of providing services to us.
We do not provide a customer's personal information to third parties 
for third-party direct marketing purposes if we have received and 
processed a request from that customer not to have his or her personal 
information shared for this purpose.
You may submit this type of 
opt-out request by sending an email message to our Customer Services 
department by clicking here.

How are cookies used on the Sites?
The Sites use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags to track traffic flow and patterns of travel within and through the Sites.
Some types of Software we distribute also use cookies to indicate the distribution source for the software (so we can appropriately compensate our distributors and to provide us retention and usage information) and to store user preferences.
Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information on a user's system.
Our Web server automatically asks a new user's browser whether it will accept our cookie file.
If the user's browser accepts our cookie, our Web server will record the cookie's unique ID for our use in internal reporting.
Every time the user returns to the Site, we will be able to read that cookie's ID number and can customize the services we deliver based on the user's past preferences.
Nonetheless, these preferences remain anonymous because we do not actively associate the cookie ID with any personally identifiable user information.
If a user accepts our cookie, but would later like to remove it from his or her computer, he or she can delete it using the browser.
(Consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies.)
==========
We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any personally identifiable information, and we do not disclose cookie information to third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.
We use third party advertisement serving companies to serve ads 
when you visit the Sites.
These companies may use information about 
your visit to the Sites in order to provide advertisements about 
goods and services that may be of interest to you.
In the course 
of serving advertisements to the Sites, these companies may place 
or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies 
such as pixel tags in connection to the Sites.
Our Privacy Policy 
does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad serving 
company may collect from you.

Do we use your information to deliver targeted online ads to you?
A targeted online ad is one we display to you based 
on the content of the pages you visit, any personal information 
you have provided to us, or keywords appearing in your search queries.
We do not directly provide any personally identifiable information 
to the advertiser when you interact with or view one of these targeted 
ads; however, advertisers (including ad serving companies) might 
indirectly obtain information on your interests in that they may 
assume that people who interact with, view, or click on their targeted 
ads meet the targeting criteria that the they specified when placing 
the ad.

In what other situations may we disclose your information?
==========
Law Enforcement/Legal Requirements.
We may disclose 
your personally identifiable information as well as your IP address 
and other information to comply with court orders or subpoenas or 
when required to do so by law.
We also may disclose such information 
in cooperation with a law enforcement or government request or where 
we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action 
regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving 
potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations 
of our Terms 
of Service, as necessary to render or conduct a legitimate business 
activity related to a service we provide, or to comply with legal 
or regulatory obligations.
Corporate Restructuring.
We also may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger or other transfer of assets).

What happens when you leave the Sites to go to other Internet sites?
We do not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than the Sites.
When you are on the Sites, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.
For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a search result, the "click" may take you off of the Sites.
These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you.
We are not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data, that you may create when using such third party sites.
==========
We also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by us and selected companies.
In many cases, these co-branded services will contain the Sites' branding, but might not be hosted by us.
You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by," if our standard branding is not displayed on the top of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information.
In such cases, you should follow the privacy link on the page to determine which company's privacy policy protects the information you enter on the page.
Even if the page is governed by a separate privacy policy, we might be entitled to receive information about what you do when using that service.
If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service.
We encourage you to read the privacy polices of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
When we enter into co-branding service relationships, we generally require the service provider to include a link to its applicable privacy policies and terms of service on the co-branded pages.

Do we take security precautions to protect your information?
We have security measures in place intended to assist in preventing unauthorized access to and in safeguarding personally identifiable information we collect online.
We seek to limit access to your personally identifiable information to employees who we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to perform their jobs.
Each of these people have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information.
Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secured; accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of any information provided to us in connection with the information that we collect online.
