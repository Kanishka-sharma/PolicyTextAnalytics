Registration
When you register for BusinessWeek.com, create an account on the Business Exchange, register for a BusinessWeek conference or event, subscribe to the digital or print edition of BusinessWeek or any of our newsletters, BusinessWeek collects your contact information (including your name, address and email address).
This information is added to our mailing list so that, from time to time, we can send you information about new features, additions, participation in market research, and changes to BusinessWeek's products and services.
Also, BusinessWeek occasionally makes contact information available to other units within The McGraw-Hill Companies as well as to selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you.
==========
We use the credit card or payment information we acquire from you solely to fulfill your order.
Information collected from all BusinessWeek.com and Business Exchange registrants, as well as digital edition subscribers and US subscribers to the print edition of BusinessWeek is stored in a secure database in the United States.
Information collected from BusinessWeek subscribers located outside of the US is stored in a secure database in the United Kingdom.
Access to both databases is limited to authorized persons.
From time to time, we may also share your information with outside vendors who will be authorized to use this information solely to perform services (such as a "mailing" house) on our behalf.

Users of the Business Exchange may choose to create a public user profile.
Elements of the public profile include name, title, industry, skills, professional experience, recent Business Exchange activity, recent topics visited, names of people in your network (and any information they have made public), your personal photograph.
Users of the Business Exchange may elect to keep their entire profile, including these elements, private.
Creating a public profile is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself to other users of the Business Exchange and allows you to see information from other public users.
