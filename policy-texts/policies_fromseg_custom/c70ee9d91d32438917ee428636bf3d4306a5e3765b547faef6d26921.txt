Asana User Terms of Service
Effective Date: November 1, 2018
Asana, Inc. (“Asana,” “we,” “our”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application (collectively, the “Service”), and websites, including but not limited to www.asana.com, wavelength.com, blog.asana.com, community.asana.com (the “Websites”).
Asana has three different types of users depending on the Asana products used:

We call users of the Websites “Site Visitors.”
We call users who use the free version of the Asana Service “Free Users.”
While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers.
We call users who use the Service as part of a paid Asana subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) “Subscribers.”
The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between Asana and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the “Customer Agreement”).
==========
We refer to these three types of users collectively as “Users” or “you” for purposes of these User Terms of Service (the “Terms”).
Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal agreement directly between you and Asana and explain the rules governing use of the Service and Websites.
By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service and Websites.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: DISPUTES ABOUT THESE TERMS AND THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES PROVIDED BY ASANA ARE SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN THE “MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” SECTION BELOW.
==========
We may, from time to time, modify these Terms.
Please check this page periodically for updates.
If you do not agree to, or cannot comply with, the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service and Websites.
==========
The updated Terms will take effect upon their posting and will apply on a going-forward basis, unless otherwise provided in a notice to you, and except as provided in the Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section of these Terms.
Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

==========
THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND SERVICE AND WEBSITES
The Service and Websites may provide (1) information and content provided by third parties; (2) links to third-party websites or resources, such as sellers of goods and services; and (3) third-party products and services for sale directly to you.
Asana is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for (i) any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources, (ii) any errors or omissions in these websites or resources, or (iii) any information handling practices or other business practices of the operators of such sites or resources.

You agree that Asana shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service and Websites.
12.
==========
MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
==========
12.1 Application.
You and Asana agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
==========
This Section 12 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.
12.2.
==========
Initial Dispute Resolution.
Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration.
If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at dispute-notice@asana.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account).
Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Asana, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
==========
12.3 Binding Arbitration.
If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, (except as provided in section 12.7 below) subject to the terms set forth below.
==========
Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms’ formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of Asana shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (“JAMS”).
The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Asana will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.
Asana will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
==========
12.4 Arbitrator’s Powers.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.
==========
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
12.5 Filing a Demand.
To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration (“Demand”) that (i) briefly explains the dispute, (ii) lists your and Asana’s names and addresses, (iii) specify the amount of money in dispute, if applicable, (iv) identify the requested location for a hearing if an in-person hearing is requested, and (v) state what you want in the dispute; (b) send one copy of the Demand to JAMS, along with a copy of these Terms and the filing fee required by JAMS; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at dispute-notice@asana.com.
==========
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
==========
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration.
For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you and Asana agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, United States, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
==========
12.6 Class Action Waiver.
The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
YOU AND ASANA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
==========
12.7 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
Either party may also seek relief in small claims court in San Francisco, California for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
==========
12.8 30-Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to dispute-notice@asana.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.”
==========
The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of the Service or within 30 days of changes to this section being announced on the Site.
Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.
If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Asana also will not be bound by them.
==========
12.9 Changes to This Section.
Asana will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Service and Websites.
Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Service and Websites or sent to you by email.
Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.
If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to This Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Service and Websites.
==========
12.10 Survival.
This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Service and Websites.
13.
==========
CONTROLLING LAW AND SEVERABILITY
These Terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of California notwithstanding its conflicts of law principles.
Any dispute arising out of these terms and conditions or the use of this site shall be initiated and conducted in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California, and you and Asana consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.
14.
==========
GENERAL TERMS
14.1 Force Majeure.
Under no circumstances shall Asana or its licensor or supplier be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control.
==========
14.2 No Waiver.
No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be binding unless in writing, no waiver of any provisions of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and the failure of Asana to exercise or enforce any right or remedy in these Terms does not waive that right or remedy.
If an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
==========
14.3 Third-Party Beneficiaries.
You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.
==========
14.4 Statute of Limitations.
Except for residents of New Jersey, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Service and Websites and/or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
==========
14.5 Miscellaneous.
These Terms (and all terms and conditions incorporated herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Asana and govern your use of the Service and Websites, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Asana on the subject matter.
These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by you.
These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may be assigned or delegated by Asana without restriction.

If you are using the Service and Websites for or on behalf of the U.S. government, your license rights do not exceed those granted to non-government consumers.
==========
The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Any provision of these Terms that by its nature is reasonably intended to survive beyond termination of these Terms shall survive.
==========

Under the GDPR, organizations that collect, maintain, use, or otherwise process EU residents’ personal data (regardless of the organization’s location) must implement certain privacy and security safeguards for that data.
Asana has established a comprehensive GDPR compliance program and is committed to partnering with its customers and vendors on GDPR compliance efforts.
Some significant steps Asana has taken to align its practices with the GDPR include:

Revisions to our policies and contracts with our partners, vendors, and users
Enhancements to our security practices and procedures
Closely reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share
Creating more robust internal privacy and security documentation
Training employees on GDPR requirements and privacy/security best practices generally
Carefully evaluating and building a data subject rights’ policy and response process

Below, we provide additional details about the core areas of Asana’s GDPR compliance program and how customers can use Asana to support their own GDPR compliance initiatives.
Data Processing Agreements
Under the GDPR, “data controllers” (i.e. entities that determine the purposes and means of processing data) are required to enter into agreements with other entities that process data on their behalf (called “data processors”).
Asana offers its customers who are controllers of EU personal data the option to enter into a Data Processing Addendum under which Asana commits to process and safeguard personal data in accordance with GDPR requirements.
This includes Asana’s commitment to process personal data consistent with the instructions of the data controller.
International Data Transfers
EU data protection laws require organizations to use a recognized legal mechanism to transfer data from the EU to countries that do not have a similar data protection framework, including the United States.
While the transfer of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the US under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks is no longer valid, Asana's Data Processing Addendum includes the Standard Contractual Clauses, which continue to serve as a legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the EEA.
Asana also uses the Standard Contractual Clauses with all of our subprocessors.
Although we cannot rely on Privacy Shield to transfer EEA and Swiss data, Asana has decided to keep its Privacy Shield certification to continue to safeguard the data already transferred under Privacy Shield and as a commitment to its data protection safeguards.
==========
The regulatory guidance in this area continues to evolve, and we are tracking additional guidance from data protection authorities closely.
Asana remains committed to the privacy of our customers and will continue to work to make sure we comply with data protection laws.
Data Access, Management, and Portability Tools
The GDPR gives individual data subjects in certain circumstances the rights to, among other things, access, delete, and make corrections to their personal data.
Asana is committed to facilitating data subject requests consistent with the GDPR, as further described in our Privacy Policy.
Privacy Documentation
At its core, the GDPR is focused on transparency, fairness, and accountability.
==========
Accordingly, the law requires organizations to maintain documentation about their privacy practices and their decisions about how they handle individuals’ personal data.
Asana shares the GDPR’s commitment to these principles and has included within its ongoing GDPR compliance program documentation about its data collection and processing activities, and the various policies and guidelines it follows pursuant to the GDPR.
You can learn more about how Asana collects, uses, and discloses personal data by visiting Asana’s Privacy Policy.
Data Security
The GDPR requires organizations to use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal data.
Security continues to be a priority for Asana, and we have successfully completed our SOC 2 (Type I) and (Type II) audits for controls relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality.
==========
This means that an independent third party has both validated our processes and practices with respect to these three trust services criteria and confirmed our ability to maintain compliance with the controls we have implemented.
We have likewise implemented a variety of safeguards to protect the security of our platform, including encrypting web connections to protect data transmissions, replicating our databases to support reliability of the platform, and controlling access to our facilities and office network.
Asana also offers customers the ability to use additional security controls to further enhance the security of their teams’ data.
For more information, please see our Security Statement.

Exercising Your Rights Under the GDPR
If you would like to exercise your rights under the GDPR, please submit your request by completing our GDPR Data Subject Rights Form or by contacting us at privacy@asana.com.
California Consumer Privacy Act
The CCPA, which comes into force on January 1, 2020, is a law that provides California consumers certain rights with respect to their personal information.
Specifically, the law requires that businesses subject to the statute grant consumers the ability to request access to and deletion of their data, and the ability to opt out of “sales” of their personal information.
The law also restricts how service providers that process personal information on behalf of a business may use that information.
Asana does not sell its customers’ or users’ personal information.
Where a business subject to the CCPA has entered into a services or subscription agreement with Asana, Asana will also act as a service provider to that business.
Specifically, Asana will process such customers’ personal information only for the purposes set forth in the applicable agreement, and will cooperate with customers to fulfill deletion or access requests.
CCPA Data Processing Addendum
Asana has updated its Data Processing Addendum to specifically reference the CCPA, and we make an explicit commitment in our DPA not to sell personal information.
If your organization is a customer of Asana and requires a CCPA addendum, please sign and return the DPA to dpa@asana.com.
Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA
For more information about how Asana provides individual consumers with the ability to access and request deletion of their personal information under the CCPA, please see Section VI (“Privacy Information for California Residents”) of our Privacy Policy.
If you would like to exercise any of your rights under California law with respect to your personal information, please submit your request by completing Asana’s CCPA Consumer Rights Form or by contacting us at privacy@asana.com.
==========
Ongoing Compliance and Communication
Both the GDPR and CCPA’s requirements are comprehensive, but the law and regulatory guidance continues to evolve when it comes to privacy and data protection – and not just in the EU or the United States.
As data protection authorities and regulators interpret and issue guidance on the GDPR, CCPA, and other currently existing data protection laws around the world and as countries pass new data protection laws, we will continue to follow these developments closely and evaluate our program for any changes or enhancements as needed.
Finally, we value communication with our customers.
If you have any questions about our data protection practices, please contact us at privacy@asana.com.
==========
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions – companies that offer consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance – to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.
Service providers who are permitted by the financial institutions to access their consumers' nonpublic personal information (NPI) are also required to comply with GLBA.
Asana complies with GLBA's Privacy Rule and Safeguards Rule.
==========
In addition to implementing security safeguards, we only use customer work content to provide our services, and not for any other purpose.
Customers should not store sensitive personal data (including financial account numbers and social security numbers) in Asana.
==========
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that requires academic institutions like colleges and universities to protect the privacy of students educational records.
Asana enables our customers to comply with FERPA by ensuring personal data is kept secure and only used to provide our services as described in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
Asana contractually commits to not disclosing customer data except as directed by the contracting academic institution, as allowed by our terms, or as required by law.

==========
This Addendum is effective on the date Customer activates HIPAA compliance for its instance of the Service (the “Addendum Effective Date”).
As of the Addendum Effective Date, this Addendum will supplement and be incorporated by reference into the agreement between Customer and Asana that governs Customer’s use of the Service, whether such agreement is online or has been executed by the Parties in writing (“Agreement”).
==========
As between the parties, Customer is the “Covered Entity” and Asana is the “Business Associate” (each a “Party” and, collectively, the “Parties”) with regard to their respective obligations pursuant to the privacy and security requirements of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“HITECH Act”), certain regulations promulgated under HIPAA by the United States Department of Health and Human Services at 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164 and certain regulations promulgated pursuant to the HITECH Act (collectively, “HIPAA”).
The purpose of this Addendum is to help facilitate Customer’s compliance with the requirements of HIPAA and Business Associate’s compliance with HIPAA to the extent Customer discloses Protected Health Information (as defined below) to Business Associate in connection with Customer’s use of the Service.
In circumstances in which Customer may be a business associate, Customer appoints Business Associate as Customer’s subcontractor, which will not change the obligations of either Customer or Business Associate under this Addendum.
To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between this Addendum, any previously executed business associate agreement, and the terms of the Agreement (including the prohibition on sensitive personal information), this Addendum will govern.
==========
A. Definitions.

==========
Compliance with Laws.
Business Associate agrees to comply with the provisions of HIPAA that are applicable to Business Associate.
Use and Disclosure of PHI.
Business Associate will not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate HIPAA if used or disclosed by Customer, provided, however, that Business Associate may use and disclose PHI as Required by Law.
Business Associate agrees, to the extent that Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Customer’s obligation(s) under Subpart E of 45 C.F.R. Part 164, to comply with the requirements of Subpart E of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 that apply to Customer in the performance of such obligation(s).
==========
Safeguards.

Business Associate will implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of any electronic PHI it receives, maintains, or transmits on behalf of Customer and will comply, where applicable, with Subpart C of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 with respect to such electronic PHI to prevent use or disclosure of such electronic PHI other than as provided for by this Addendum.
==========
Disclosure to Agents and Subcontractors.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Business Associate, subject to the restrictions set forth in this provision, may use subcontractors and agents to fulfill its obligations under this Addendum.
If Business Associate discloses PHI received from Customer, or received, maintained, or transmitted by Business Associate on behalf of Customer, to agents, including a subcontractor, Business Associate will, in accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii) and 164.308(b)(2), if applicable, ensure that any agents or subcontractors that receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to Business Associate under this Addendum with respect to such information.

A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.
An SDK is a section of code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Websites.

Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, email open rates, measure popularity of the Websites and associated advertising, and to access user cookies.
==========
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.
Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).

F.	Website Analytics and Advertising


Website Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Websites to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; and provide certain features to you.
To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.
Online Advertising
The Websites may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Websites, as well as on other websites you visit.
==========
The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you.
These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
==========
Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Websites, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above.
We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our Websites and other websites and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Websites.
We sometimes provide Site Visitor information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites.
We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Websites by such non-affiliated third parties.
If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page.
We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
==========
We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Websites, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.
==========
Notice Concerning Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.
==========
However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.
To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.

The Websites may contain links to third-party websites and functionalities.
If you choose to use these third party services, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function.
Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Asana, Asana is not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services.
The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy.
We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.

Asana has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.
If there is any conflict between the policies in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Asana at: privacy@asana.com.
Asana has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Privacy Shield, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Asana, please visit the BBB EU Privacy Shield web site at https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint.
Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.
Asana is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to its compliance with the provisions of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield.
==========
We may transfer information that we collect about you to third party processors across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
==========
Asana will take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary to ensure that any third party who is acting as a “data processor” under EU and Swiss terminology is processing the personal data we entrust to them in a manner that is consistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles.
Asana is potentially liable in cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, respectively.

We will make the revised Policy accessible through the Service and Websites, so you should review the Policy periodically.
If we make a material change to the Policy, we will comply with applicable legal requirements regarding providing you with notice and/or consent.
C.
==========
How We Protect Your Information
Asana takes technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure, and thus we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.
==========
D.	Marketing Practices and Choices
If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.
This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
==========
You may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us at the “Asana Contact Info” section below.
In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails.

If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines
These guidelines are intended to provide law enforcement authorities with information regarding the process for requesting records from Asana.
So that we can ensure compliance with our user Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, we respond only to law enforcement requests that adhere to established legal process and applicable law.
==========
U.S. Legal Process Requirements.
We disclose user information solely in accordance with our published Terms of Service and applicable U.S. law, including the federal Stored Communications Act ("SCA"), 18 U.S.C. Sections 2701-2712.
In accordance with U.S. law:
A jurisdictionally valid subpoena, issued in connection with an official criminal investigation, is required to compel the disclosure of basic user records, which may include name, length of service, credit card information (including billing address), email address(es), and an IP address, if available.
A court order is required to compel the disclosure of certain records or other information related to a user account (not including contents of communications), which may include message headers and IP addresses, in addition to the basic user records identified above.
A search warrant properly issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, based on a showing of probable cause, is required to compel the disclosure of the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, attachments, or other content of communications within a user’s account.
International Legal Requirements.
In the case of requests from law enforcement outside of the U.S., a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request or letter rogatory may be required to compel the disclosure of the contents of an account.
==========
Account Preservation Requests.
We will take reasonable steps to preserve account records in connection with official criminal investigations for a period of 90 days pending our receipt of a formal legal request for user data.
You may request the preservation of records via email or mail as indicated below.

User Notification.
Asana’s policy is to notify users of requests for their information, which includes a copy of the request, prior to disclosure so that they may have an opportunity to challenge such request unless: (a) we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order; (b) there are exceptional circumstances, such as an emergency involving the risk of bodily injury or death to a person or group of people or potential harm to minors; or (c) prior notice would be counterproductive (for example, if we believe that the account in question has been hijacked).
Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain a proper court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.
Please note that Officer authored affidavits, cover letters or similar statements are not sufficient to preclude notice to our users.
==========
Please note that in situations where a data request draws attention to an ongoing violation of our Terms of Service we may, in order to protect our service and its Users, take action to prevent any further abuse, including actions that could notify the User(s) who are the subject of your data request that we are aware of their misconduct.

Amendment to Asana Subscriber Agreement
Applicable to Government Customers
Last Updated: November 5, 2019
As referenced In Section 11.10 of the Subscriber Agreement, this is a supplemental agreement (“Amendment”) between Asana and Government customers in the United States (the “Customer” or the “Agency”) and applies to an Agency’s use of Asana’s collaborative workplace management service (the “Service”) in its official capacity under Asana’s Subscriber Agreement (the “Subscriber Agreement”).
The reason for this Amendment is that the Customer, a Government instrumentality, must follow state and/or federal laws, regulations, and practices, among which are those relating to ethics, advertising and endorsements, tax exemption and immunity, limitations on indemnification, fiscal law constraints, governing law and jurisdiction, dispute resolution, and assignment of contracts.
==========
Asana and Agency (the “Parties”) agree that modifications to the Subscriber Agreement available at https://asana.com/terms#subscriber-agreement are appropriate to accommodate the Agency’s legal status, its public mission, and other special circumstances.
Therefore, the Subscriber Agreement is modified by this Amendment as follows.
==========
A. Government entity: As it relates to the Agency’s usage of the Service, the word “Customer” in the Subscriber Agreement for purposes of official Agency use of the Service shall mean the Agency itself and shall not apply to, nor bind (i) the individual(s) who utilize the Asana Service on the Agency’s behalf, or (ii) any individual users who are employed by, or otherwise associated with, the Agency.
Asana will look solely to the Agency to enforce any violation or breach of the Subscriber Agreement by such individuals, subject to federal law.
B. Advertisements: Asana agrees not to serve or display any third-party commercial advertisements or solicitations on any pages within the Asana site that display content uploaded by or under the control of the Agency.
==========
C. Taxes: With reference to Section 3.4 of the Subscriber Agreement, the Parties understand that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 29.302 (48 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 29, Subpart 29.302 – Application of State and local taxes to the Government) states that “Generally, purchases and leases made by the Federal Government are immune from State and local taxation.”
Therefore, Asana will include no tax in Agency billings for Federal Government Agency accounts unless the tax has been determined by the Agency to be proper for payment.
==========
D. Indemnification, Liability, Statute of Limitations: Any provisions in the Subscriber Agreement related to indemnification by the customer, damages, attorneys’ fees, filing deadlines, defense of lawsuits, collection expenses, and settlement are hereby waived.
