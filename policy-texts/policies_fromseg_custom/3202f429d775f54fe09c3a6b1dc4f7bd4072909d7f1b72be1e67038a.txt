What are cookies?
==========
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website.
Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user returns to a website or goes to another website.
Cookies are often used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics.
This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, make the website easier to use, measure the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailor their website to better match a user’s interests and preferences.Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a user’s hard drive, or to personally identify them.
Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive.

How is our information secured and protected?
All of the user data collected by Digitize is stored only in aggregate form meaning that information about a specific user cannot be retrieved.
Even so we maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorised or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction.
The data is kept on a secure server and we restrict access to the data solely to authorized users.
==========
No security measures, however thorough, are perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess.
Information sharing
The security of information is important to us.
We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it.
This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Non-PII information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us at privacy@digitize.ie
As described above, Digitize stores only aggregated data on its servers.
==========
We may disclose Non-PII information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
Also, in the event that Digitize is merged into another company, or another company acquires all or substantially all of Digitize’s assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, all data compiled or owned by Digitize may be among the items transferred in that transaction.
In such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this Policy.
