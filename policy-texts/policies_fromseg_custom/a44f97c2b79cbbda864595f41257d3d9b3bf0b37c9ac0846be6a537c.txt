Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting Answers.comTM or Brainboost.comTM (the "Sites"), each an Answers Corporation ("Answers") website.
Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at the Sites and in connection with the various services and software products we provide on or through the Sites (for example, 1-Click AnswersTM, collectively the "Services").
This policy only addresses the Sites and Services.
Other websites, such as those we to which we link or with which we co-brand, may have their own policies.
What We Track
When you use the Sites and the Services, a random number ("User ID") is assigned to you and we know you simply by that User ID.
==========
We collect data about user activity only in aggregate form in an effort to assess and react to general usage trends (frequency, common topics, peak usage times, etc.).
None of the Services is spyware; we do not run any background processes that report back to us information about your software or hardware configuration or your web browsing or purchasing habits.
None of the Services is a "keylogger".
The only keystroke that the Services report to our servers is the Alt-Click (we call it Alt-Click but it can be any other key combination that you chose) that you perform on text to look it up.
==========
This function is only activated when you hold down the Alt key and click on a word or phrase.
When you Alt-Click on a word, we perform contextual analysis on the Alt-Clicked word by sending other words surrounding the Alt-Clicked word to our server so that we can deliver the best page for your query.
For example, if you Alt-Click on "Jordan", we return different pages if the word before is "Michael" or if the word after is "River."
This surrounding contextual data is used only to help clarify your target word and is not used for any sales or marketing purposes.
==========
In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
The Usage Data (i.e. non-personally identifiable data) we track about our users may be used and shared with third parties on an aggregate basis (e.g., our corporate customers or third-party content providers) in order to provide a better or more customer-focused service to our users.
In addition to serving its own advertisements, Answers uses third-party advertising networks to serve ads when you visit the Sites.
Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors, and research firms.
In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our ad networks may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser or use a "web beacon."
For more information on the Sites' use of such third-party ad servers, please click here.
Please note that Ad networks' use of cookies or web beacons, and that of any other third-party that has a link available on any Site, is subject to their own privacy policies and not this privacy policy.
How We Track It: The Sites and Services use either cookies and/or registry settings on your computer to store user information.
A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.
==========
Additionally, some ad networks may use web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about usage on the Sites.
A web beacon is a transparent image, typically in GIF format that can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of page view, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.
The information collected through the use of cookies or web beacons is not personally identifiable (i.e. it does not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number) and is used only to improve the quality of the Sites and Services, to better understand how people interact with us, to measure advertising effectiveness, and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
You may disable cookies on your web browser, thereby also rendering some web beacons unusable.
You can use the Sites and Services even if cookies are disabled, but this may impact our ability to adapt any of the Sites or Services according to your preferences.
Information Sharing: We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent.
We may share such information in any of the following limited circumstances:
We have your consent.
==========
We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Answers, its users or the public.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of any of the Sites and/or Services, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice by posting such notice on the Sites before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Changes to This Privacy Statement: Answers may amend this policy from time to time.
If we make any major changes in the way your personally identifiable data may be used, we will notify you by posting the new text on Answers.com.
Questions or Suggestions: If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this privacy policy, please contact Answers at privacy@answers.com.
