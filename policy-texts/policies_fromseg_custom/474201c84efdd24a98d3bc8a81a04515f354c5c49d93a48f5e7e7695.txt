Your Choices and Rights
If you live in certain jurisdictions such as the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), Switzerland, or California, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use of information about you.
In particular, you have the right to: (i) request access and obtain a copy of your User Information, and (ii) request erasure, or deletion of your User Information.
You may also have the right to request rectification of your User Information, to obtain your User Information in a portable format, to object to or restrict the processing of your User Information, to prevent the use of your User Information for particular purposes, and to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please see our Data Opt Out Policy for instructions on how to do so.
==========
Information Retention
The cookies set out on your device by our advertising technology expire no later than 366 days after the last time you visited a Digital Media Property using our advertising technology.
We typically store the User Information we collect from your device, such as IP address and other information described above, in our systems for up to 90 days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
In some cases, we may keep some of the User Information for longer periods of time where required under certain laws or to comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests – for example, those relating to corporate governance, taxation, money laundering and financial reporting legislation.
==========
Security
We use industry-standard technical and organizational security measures to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems.
Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however, can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.

Additional Information for California Residents
If you are a resident of California, please review these additional privacy disclosures.
Your Rights
California law requires us to disclose the categories of personal information we collect and how we use them, the categories of sources from which we collect personal information, and the third parties with whom we share personal information, which we have explained above.
We are also required to communicate information about rights you have under California law—for information about these rights, please see “Your Choices and Rights” above.
You also have the right to request what information we collect and how we use and disclose it.
You may exercise these rights by visiting our Data Subject Rights policy.
Please note that because most of the information we store can only identify a particular browser or device, and cannot identify you individually, you need to provide us with some additional information to enable us to identify the User Information we hold about you, if any, and ensure that we accurately fulfill your request.
If you have any questions about your rights or our disclosures, you may reach us at privacy@advangelists.com.
==========
In addition, we are required to provide you certain information about the business and commercial purposes for which we collect and share your personal information.
We use and disclose the information we collect for the business purposes described in the “How We Use User Information” section of this policy, including: to allow our clients to select and display advertisements, to understand how users interact with our services, for auditing purposes, to detect security incidents, to prevent fraud, debug, and repair errors, and for other purposes described above.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
Advangelists does not sell User Information, but our clients may use our technology to buy or sell personal information as defined by California law.
==========
If you wish to opt out of the use of your personal information for interest-based advertising purposes, you may do so by clicking here or by following the instructions under Your Opt-Out Choices above.
Note that because these opt outs are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on each browser and device.
==========
Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
