Security
Activision takes a range of security measures designed to help protect your Information.

Activision takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, and scores, etc.).
We also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.
In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.
However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.
The complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.
