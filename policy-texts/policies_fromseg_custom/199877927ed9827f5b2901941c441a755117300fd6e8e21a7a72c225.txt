Make the collection of consents a central axis in the relationship of trust with your users.
Give your users back control of their personal data.
==========
Opt for a transparent, secure and compliantconsent collection.
At SFBX, our main concern is to re-establish a relationship of trust between users and the various digital actors thanks to a reasoned and transparent use of personal data in order to offer them a personalized quality experience.
==========
Through the secure and transparent collection of consent allowing the processing of his data, the user can control its use.
With this newfound control, the user is free to choose to share their data in a relevant and unambiguous way.
With our technological and UX expertise, we also want to raise awareness of the need to put the consumer back at the center of consent collection mechanisms.
Re-establishing a relationship of trust
GIVE back control to users
A trusted third party role in the management of personal data
We are convinced that re-establishing dialogue between the various players will be the cornerstone of tomorrow's digital ecosystem.
The user must be at the heart of the consent collection process.
==========
His choice must be respected and considered as a priority by the data controllers in order to offer him the expected service.
Regardless of its location, data must now be collected and distributed differently, in compliance with regulations.

UX Design as a common thread
UX Design, for User Experience Design, is a set of methods whose objective is to place the human being at the heart of the design process by identifying his needs and obstacles in a given context.
At SFBX, UX is considered in our solutions from the first design thoughts, and at all stages leading to the availability on the market.
It is about understanding, identifying and respecting both the needs of Internet users and those of companies regarding personal data.
The goal is to provide them with a memorable experience.
As the market evolves and new regulations are introduced, we regularly consult with users to anticipate the full range of interactions with our products, through various types of testing.
