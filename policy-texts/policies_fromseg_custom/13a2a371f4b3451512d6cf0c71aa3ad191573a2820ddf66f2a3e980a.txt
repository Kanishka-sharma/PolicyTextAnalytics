Privacy Policy
Effective date: 19/09/2014

This policy provides an overview of the type of data that Remerge collects, how we 

use these data and what safeguards we have put in place in order to ensure their 

protection.
About Remerge
We deliver display app retargeting campaigns of third party mobile app developers

inside other apps.
These ads are selected based on user’s geographic location, 

device information, their use of other apps integrated with our partners and 

information provided to us about the user by publishers and developers.
We enable our partnering publishers and developers to provide content-rich services 

that are more relevant to their users, often using advertising revenues they generate 

to offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost.

customised to individuals’ inferred interests, preferences and locations but also in 

order to perform analysis aiming to improve our services and technologies.

campaigns of our partners and to provide them with performance reports.

reports, analyses, and similar materials that we may use for sales, marketing or other 

business purposes.
As described above, we share data only with the users of our service that are strictly
