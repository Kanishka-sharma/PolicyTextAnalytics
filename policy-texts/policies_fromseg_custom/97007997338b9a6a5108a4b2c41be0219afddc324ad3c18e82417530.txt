The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control
The NBA.com Network has generally accepted security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control.
The servers for the NBA.com Network that contain personally identifiable information are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility.
Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks, and restricting access to information on our servers.
When receiving financial information (e.g., credit card number, credit card expiration date) for completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the NBA.com/WNBA Store, the NBA Photo Store, and Audio League Pass, our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol.
Other features, like email and contact us are not encrypted.
When providing sensitive information on the Internet, you should also look at your browser to determine whether SSL technology is being employed (usually indicated by an image of a lock in the browser frame).
In addition, only those trained employees needed to carry out our business functions will be authorized to have access to information on individual NBA.com Network customers.
It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties.
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

NBA.COM NETWORK NOTE TO PARENTS

It is the NBA.com Network's policy not to knowingly solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
==========
A number of interactive features on the NBA.com Network require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, membership).
All registrants will be required to enter their full name, date of birth, e-mail address and complete address.
In some cases, users will be required to select a special member name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password.
==========
If the NBA.com Network determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the enrollment process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information.
Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on the NBA.com Network, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information.
Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on the NBA.com Network that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be contacted about special offers or promotions.
The NBA.com Network works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on the NBA.com Network.
==========
Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the web sites on which registration occurs.
Such third party sites may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with the privacy policies posted on those sites.
The operators of those third party sites are responsible for ensuring that their sites comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.
For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.
