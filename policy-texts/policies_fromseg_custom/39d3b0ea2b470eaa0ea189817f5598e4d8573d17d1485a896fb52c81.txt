What's in the WhoIs directory?
The WhoIs directory is a searchable list of every single domain name registered in the world, including the names, addresses and other details of the people who own them.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires accredited registrars to publish this information in the WhoIs listing as soon as the domain is registered.
So everyone can see my information?
==========
The short answer is yes.
The name, address and phone number you submit when you register your domain is publicly accessible by anyone at any time.
==========
This may be good news if you have a domain name you'd like to sell.
Or it may be bad news if your name and contact info is collected by a spammer, hacker or cyber-criminal.
What about my business?
==========
I want people to find me.
Privacy and Business Protection includes a "virtual business card" designed to drive traffic to your website and increase the reach of your existing efforts without sacrificing your privacy.
How does Privacy Protection work?
==========
Instead of displaying your personal information in the WhoIs database for all to see, our partner Domains By Proxy will replace it with its own.
The domain will belong to you - except now, you and Domains By Proxy® will be the only ones who know it.
What are the benefits of Privacy Protection?
Privacy Protection through Domains By Proxy gives you full control over your domain names while protecting you from identity theft, domain-related spam and domain name hijacking.
Domains By Proxy even creates a private and unique email address for each domain name.
You get to decide if you want the email forwarded to you, filtered, or completely blocked.

What is Privacy & Business Protection?
Privacy & Business Protection delivers an extra layer of protection on top of Privacy Protection.
It includes all the features of Privacy Protection plus:
Domain Name Ownership Protection — Keeps you from losing your domain name if you forget to renew it, or if we can't charge your credit card.
You have one year to rescue your domain, which can be done by paying the renewal fees for your domain name as well as your privacy plan.
==========
Deadbolt Transfer Protection — Puts your domain name on lockdown, making inadvertent, accidental, or malicious transfers impossible.
Deadbolt Protection offers an even higher level of security than regular domain name locking - we actually lock your domain name in your account.
==========
Ownership Protection Reports — Email updates and an annual domain name status report help you keep track of vital domain name information
Business Registration — Provides a business card listing that is instantly available to everyone who searches for your domain name in the WhoIs database
NOTE: Before you purchase Privacy & Business Protection, make sure the Registrant contact for your domain name includes a valid email address.
You must have access to the registrant email address to make sure future changes to your domain name or Privacy & Business Protection service.
For more information, see  Updating your domain name contact information
Privacy and Business Protection is not available for some domain names, primarily country-code extensions (ccTLDs).
