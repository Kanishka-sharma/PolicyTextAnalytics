We have implemented a variety of security measures to protect Personal Information that we receive, including
       containing all Personal Information behind a secured server network and restricting access to only permit a

       meet those obligations.
We follow commercially reasonable measures (or other standards required by
       applicable law) to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and while in
       our possession.
We also review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including
       physical security measures, to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access to our systems.
However, no
       method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we use commercially reasonable
       measures to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
11.
==========
Third Party Practices
Our Services may contain links to third-party websites.
Synacor is not responsible for the privacy practices,
       content, or the products and services offered by such websites.
Because we cannot control the activities of
       third parties, we do not accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Information by such third
       parties, except as required by applicable law, and we do not guarantee that they will adhere to the same
       privacy practices as Synacor.
==========
We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any other service provider
       from whom you request services.
If you click on a link via the Services and visit a third-party website, you
       should read that site’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.
12.
==========
Framing
We utilize framing techniques on some pages displayed via the Services to make it appear that the user is
       still on a Synacor or Customer website, as applicable, when the user is actually on a third-party website.
Please be aware that, if you are providing your Personal Information on these third-party websites, you are
       providing such Personal Information to these third parties and not to Synacor, and that the privacy policies
       of these third parties will apply to your Personal Information.
13.
==========
Data Transfers
Your Personal Information may be processed on servers located outside of the jurisdiction where you live.
Data protection laws vary among jurisdictions, with some providing more protection than others.
Regardless
       of where your information is processed, Synacor will follow the provisions described in this policy.
==========
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint.
Solely
       to the extent required by applicable law, we work with the appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any
       complaints regarding the transfer of your Personal Information that we cannot resolve with you directly.
14.
==========
Privacy Shield
Synacor participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
Synacor is committed to subjecting all Personal Information received from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to compliance with the Privacy Shield Framework and to the Privacy Shield Framework’s Principles.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at www.privacyshield.gov.

With respect to Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Synacor is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
In certain situations, Synacor may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities (including, but not limited to, a request to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
Upon certification to the Privacy Shield, Synacor (1) was included on the list of companies that have so certified located at www.privacypolicy.gov and (2) received a Certificate of Validation evidencing its compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework for Personal Information from an independent third party that specializes in compliance and security.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Framework, Synacor commits to resolve complaints about our collection, use, retention, or transfer of your Personal Information.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at www.trustarc.com/consumer-resources/dispute-resolution.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
==========
Synacor has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the European Union data protection authorities and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield Inquiries concerning human resources data transferred to the United States from the European Union and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.
In light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18 and an opinion of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commission (FDPIC) of Switzerland, Synacor does not rely on the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data (although it continues to abide by the Framework).
Synacor is implementing standard contractual clauses for transfers on an as-needed basis.
For more information about transfers from the EU to U.S. or Switzerland to U.S., please visit the visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website.
