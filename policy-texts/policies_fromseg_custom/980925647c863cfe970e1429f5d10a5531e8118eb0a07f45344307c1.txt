There likely are similarities between this policy and the policy on the website for your church, your school, your local coffee shop or your favorite online store but we all perform different services.
the Rubicon Project offers premium website publishers a technology platform that gives them complete control and visibility over their advertising inventory, and matches every impression with the highest paying demand source.
Almost all of the information we collect is from or through the web publishers and advertisers who utilize our service and not directly from consumers.
