Foursquare Labs, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries, Placed, LLC, Factual Inc., Foursquare Labs UK Limited, Factual Limited (UK), Foursquare Labs Asia Pte. Ltd., Factual Private Limited, Factual KK, and Factual Pty Ltd (collectively, “Foursquare”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) understands that your privacy is important to you and we are committed to being transparent about the technologies that we use.
This Cookie Policy should be read in connection with our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device.
They are generally used to remember you and your preferences, for one visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple visits (using a “persistent cookie”).
Cookies may be set by Foursquare (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties, such as companies who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on Foursquare Services (“third party cookies”).
==========
Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as web beacons or pixels.
Web beacons and pixels are small blocks of code on webpages and in emails that enable Foursquare to perform analytics, and are often used in connection with cookies.
Web beacons and pixels are not stored in the same ways as cookies.
As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.
Does Foursquare Use Cookies and other similar technologies?
As described in the section “What About Cookies and Similar Technologies” of our Privacy Policy, we use technologies like cookies, and pixels on our website, in our emails, and identifiers supplied by app platform companies within our apps to provide you with a range of products and services.
We use five (5) types of cookies.
==========
They are: Strictly Necessary, Functional, Performance, Targeting/Advertising and Social Media.
See below for our classification of cookies that we use on our platforms.
Why do we use cookies and other technologies?
Foursquare uses cookies and similar technologies for a number of purposes, including:

Authentication – to recognize you if you are logged in to our Services, so that we can show you the right information, understand how you use the Services and personalize your experience.
==========
Security – to support or enable security features we have deployed, and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our Terms of Service.
We do this to protect you, Foursquare and third parties.
Preferences, features and services –  to know which language you prefer, what your communications preferences.
==========
Advertising - We may work with advertisers or other partners and advertising service providers like The Trade Desk, LiveRamp, Google, Xandr to serve ads or services that may be relevant to you based on your inferred interests or location (or both) to computers, mobile phones or other devices, which may use a device ID, cookie, pixel or other similar technology placed by Foursquare or the third party (although we would not share any other information that identifies you with an advertiser) on our Services, or on a third party website or app.
The placing of these cookies, pixels or other technologies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites and you should review our Privacy Policies and the privacy policies of our advertisers, partners and advertising service providers to understand how they collect and use your data.
Attribution – We may work with advertisers or other partners to help them determine the effectiveness of an advertising campaign by providing them with pixels that they place on their websites or advertisements.
We work with service providers such as Tapad to help us match these pixels with a corresponding device ID, which is then matched against data we maintain.
==========
Performance, Analytics and Research – We sometimes use other service providers to help us provide certain products and services and to provide us information about use of the Services to improve the Services and make it appealing to as many users as possible.
For example, Foursquare uses third party analytics providers, like Google Analytics and Adjust, to better understand who is using the service and how people are using it.
As part of providing these services, these service providers may collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used.
==========
Please read their privacy policies to ensure that you are comfortable with the manner in which they use cookies.
Can cookies be turned off?
Most web browsers have an option to customize your cookie settings.
You can permission your settings to block all cookies, or only third party cookies.
Other ways to limit interest based advertising?
==========
Google has developed a web browser plugin to allow you to opt-out of Google Analytics’ tracking software.
For information about how to opt out of receiving behavioral advertisements outside of Foursquare’s apps and websites from our advertising partners, click here or click here.
You may opt out of seeing interest-based ads from us or our third party advertising partners on your desktop browser and/or mobile web browser by visiting the DAA at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
You may also opt out of seeing interest-based ads on TV streaming devices and smart TVs by visiting the NAI’s opt out for these devices at https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/.
==========
When you opt out on a particular device, we will stop using and transferring mobile app data from that device for interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, other linked devices.
Additionally, we will also stop using mobile app data coming from other linked devices for interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, the device from which the choice was exercised.
If you use more than one device, you should opt out on each device.
Certain versions of your device’s operating system permit you to opt out of interest-based advertising.
Please visit your device settings to limit such tracking.
==========
Please note that when you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but they will no longer be based on your interests or behavior.
In addition, we may also continue to collect, use and transfer browser data for purposes other than interest-based advertising and ad delivery/reporting, as described in our Privacy Policies.
At this time we do not honor Do Not Track (“DNT”) browser signals.
Please be aware that limiting the ability of websites to set cookies, however, may worsen your overall user experience, and in some cases the Services will not work properly without cookies, local storage and similar technologies.
