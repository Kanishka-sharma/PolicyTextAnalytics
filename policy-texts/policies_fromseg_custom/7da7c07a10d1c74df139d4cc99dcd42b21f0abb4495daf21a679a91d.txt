As the regulations are in the process of changing, these are some useful things to know:
The General Data Protection Regulation is an EU law, in effect since May 25, 2018.
It broadens the definition of personal data to include anything unique to an individual.
It also restates the requirements to have a legal basis for processing personal data and being transparent to data subjects (i.e. people) about what processing is taking place.
==========
Personal Data is therefore an EU term, including things like name, email address, but also unique cookie IDs and IP addresses
Personally-Identifiable Information (or PII) is a mainly U.S. term, and includes name and email address, but does NOT include cookie IDs or IP address.
(Note: this definition changes slightly for COPPA – see the separate section under Children’s Privacy below)
The ePrivacy Directive, as it is known, requires websites to obtain consent for any cookies or similar technologies that are placed on a user’s device.
==========
There is an additional EU Regulation called the ePrivacy Regulation, which is expected to take effect in 2019-2020.
Its effect is not considered in the Privacy Policy below.
==========
When you visit a site operated by one of our Partners, we collect the following data:
IP address (considered Personal Data under GDPR)
Cookie ID (considered Personal Data under GDPR)
User agent (not considered personal data, as it is not unique to an individual)
We will also log clickstream data related to the website URL, the ad you have seen, time of day, and the topics we have identified on the page.
We may also combine data we have collected with behavioural topic information from selected third party companies, but we require those companies to be of good standing and comply with the same self-regulatory and legal practices that we do.
In Europe, we require Advertisers and Digital Content Providers with whom we work to include this cookie within their legally-required cookie consent mechanisms.
==========
We have agreed with the majority of our Partners that they have a legitimate interest in either monetizing their site, or in building a relationship with their customers – and that VDX.tv has a legitimate interest in assisting them in that goal.
Please review the privacy policies of websites you visit to verify the legal basis in effect.
We also work with Partners who may ask you for your consent to process data, and VDX.tv may be listed in the consent dialogue.
Please send any questions on legal basis to privacy@VDX.tv.
By understanding what behaviours users display and which sites they visit and purchase on, we can try and show more relevant ads to users, improving the customer journey.
==========
We share the data with select companies to assist us in this goal.
They fall into three (3) categories:
Type
Data Controller or Processor?
Companies
Log storage, access
Processor
Google Cloud, AWS
Third Party Data Provider
Processor
Oracle
Exchange
Processor
Google AdX, AppNexus, Index Exchange
We also use the data, both cookie and non-cookie, for non-targeting reasons such as frequency capping, fraud prevention, reporting statistics and billing, within the permissions of the NAI/DAA Principles and EDAA Framework.
==========
Our tracking cookies are programmed to expire in ninety (90) days from the last time we encounter you, at which point the web browser will delete them automatically.
Click stream data is stored in log files, which are retained in our systems for thirteen (13) months (typically two (2) months for troubleshooting and a further eleven (11) months in case of billing or traffic fraud queries).
==========
For those sites operating under legitimate interest, it is still possible to opt out of any tracking or data usage by visiting our own opt-out page at this location: http://vdx.tv/privacy/opt-out/
Or alternatively any of the schemes operated by:
Digital Advertising Alliance
Digital Advertising Alliance Canada
European Digital Advertising Alliance
Network Advertising Initiative
These opt-out mechanisms all work by setting a cookie with the following value:
If you do not have cookies enabled, this and similar opt-out mechanisms will not work.
Opting out via cookie will prevent any further targeting, although where legally permitted to do so, we will still use IP address and user agent for the purposes of geo-targeting and frequency capping.
For any sites employing a consent mechanism, it will not be necessary to opt out.
==========
If you would like to review what data we may have about you, please contact us at privacy@vdx.tv and you will be guided through the process.
Please note that the only data that we retain on individuals is a cookie id and IP address.
We do not retain accessible log information for more than sixty (60) days.
==========

VDX.tv’s accountability for personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield and transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles.
In particular, VDX.tv remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third party agents or service providers that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a way that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless VDX.tv proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

We do not offer the targeting of advertising towards anyone under the age of thirteen (13).
In accordance with COPPA, we do not work with websites known to us to be directed to children.

Our servers are protected by firewalls and are located in secure data facilities to further increase security.

==========
We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information you have disclosed to us in response to judicial process or court order or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation of matters related to public safety, as permitted by law.

We will only utilize such data for the purpose of responding to your inquiry.
==========
However, we do reserve the right to retain an archival record of all such correspondence.
We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy by posting an updated version on this page.
The date on which the current Privacy Policy was posted will always be noted at the top of this page.
Any change we make to our Privacy Policy will be made in compliance with applicable law.
