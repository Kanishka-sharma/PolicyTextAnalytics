Information We Collect
Required Information
To open a PayPal account or use the PayPal Services, you must provide your name, address, phone number, and email address.
In order to make payments through the PayPal Services, you must provide credit card, debit card or bank account information.
We also ask you to choose two different security questions to answer (such as your city of birth or your pet's name).
==========
This required information is necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your existing password, protect you against credit card fraud and current account fraud, and contact you should the need arise in administering your account or the PayPal Services.
We will also require other commercial and/or identification information if you send or receive certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through the PayPal Services or as is otherwise required in order for us to comply with our anti-money laundering obligations under European law.
==========
When you access PayPal using a mobile device (e.g. a smartphone), we may additionally collect and store device sign-on data (including device ID) and geolocation data in order to provide our services.
If you use certain functionalities provided by us (such as the PayPal POS Functionality available in your mobile app) we may ask you to upload a picture of you in order to provide these specific services.
If we allow you to link your membership of an eligible loyalty scheme to your Account, we may require you to provide to us your loyalty scheme membership ID.
==========
Transaction Information
When you use the PayPal Services to send money to someone else or request money from someone else, we ask you to provide information related to that transaction.
This information includes the amount and type of the transaction (purchase of goods, purchase of services, or simple money transfer), other purchase details and the email address, Skype ID (if applicable) or phone number of the third party.
Also, when you send money to another PayPal customer, you may be asked to provide personal details to that customer to complete the transaction.
Those details may also be passed on to us from that customer.
==========
We retain this information for each of your transactions through the PayPal Services and may add this information to your account profile to be used for future transactions that you may make with us.
We also collect the Internet address (IP address) and other identifying information about the computer or device you use to access your PayPal account or use the PayPal Services, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorised transactions.
Information about You from Third Parties
In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify the information you provide with the "Payment Processors" and/or "Credit Reference and Fraud Agencies" listed in the table under the section "Disclosure to Third Parties other than PayPal Customers" below.
In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services.
==========
In particular, if you register a credit card or debit card or bank account with PayPal, we will use card authorisation and fraud screening services to verify that your bank or card information and address match the information you supplied to PayPal, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.
If you send or receive high overall payment volumes through the PayPal Services, or if as a merchant have limited selling history, in some circumstances we will conduct a background check on your business by obtaining information about you and your business, and potentially (if legally permitted) also about your directors, shareholders and partners, from a credit reference or fraud agency such as Dun & Bradstreet, as listed in the table under the section entitled, "Disclosure to Third Parties other than PayPal Customers" below.
If you owe us money, we may conduct a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from a credit reference or fraud agency, to the extent permitted by law.
PayPal, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to periodically retrieve and review a business and/or consumer credit report supplied by such credit reference or fraud agency for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.
If you use your PayPal account to sell items, we may also collect public information about your business and your behaviour on social media platforms (such as the e-mail address and the number of “likes” and “followers”), to the extent relevant to confirm an assessment of your transactions and/or your business, including its size and the size of its customer base.
==========
We may also collect information from members of the eBay Inc. corporate family or other companies (subject to their privacy policies).
If you are sending transaction related communication on PayPal’s or eBay’s conflict resolution platforms to your buyer or seller, we may collect such information in order to assess your transactions and any risk associated with your activities, as well as for fraud detection, prevention, and or remediation of fraud, or other illegal actions or to detect, prevent or remediate violations of policies or the applicable user agreements.
==========
Additional Verification
If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request a withdrawal by cheque to an address other than your verified credit card billing address, we may ask you to upload or send us additional information by fax (such as your driving licence, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill, or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.
Website Traffic Information
Because of the way Internet communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the PayPal website, we automatically receive the web address of the site that you came from or are going to.
We also collect information on which pages of our website you visit, IP addresses, the type of browser you use and the times you access our website.

Where explicitly specified in the table, the payment processors and credit reference and fraud agencies may use the information in their respective databases, and forward information to third parties for the purposes of fraud prevention and the assessment of creditworthiness, in accordance with their respective terms.

Disclose aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations.
For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in Manchester.
However, this aggregated information is not tied to personal information.
==========
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future PayPal could merge with, or be acquired by, another company.
If such an acquisition occurs, you consent to the successor company having access to the information maintained by PayPal, including customer account information, and such successor company would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.

==========
Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.
We also use your email address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including "News from PayPal", auction tips, customer surveys and notice of special third-party promotions.
==========
You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account on the PayPal website, selecting My Account, Profile, then My account settings, and updating your Communication preferences.

In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate.
However, these auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
==========
Your Use of Information and Our Services
In order to facilitate the transactions between PayPal users, our service allows you limited access other users' contact or delivery information.
As a seller you may have access to the User ID, email address and other contact or delivery information of the buyer, and as a buyer you may have access to the User ID, email address and other contact information of the seller.
You agree that, with respect to other users' personally identifiable information that you obtain through the PayPal Services or through a PayPal-related communication or PayPal-facilitated transaction, you will only use this information for: (a) PayPal-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) ancillary actions in relation to the PayPal payments or the transactions for which PayPal has been used (e.g. insurance, delivery and fraud complaints), and (c) any other purpose that such user consents to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).
In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove their data from your database and review any information you have collected about them.

Information Security
PayPal is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security.
We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities.
==========
For more information on PayPal's security practices, please see our Safety Advice.
The security of your PayPal account also relies on your protection of your PayPal password.
You may not share your PayPal password with anyone.
PayPal representatives will never ask you for your password, so any email or other communication requesting your password should be treated as unauthorised and suspicious and forwarded to spoof@paypal.com.
If you do share your PayPal password with a third party for any reason, including because the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password.
If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to your account and changing your Profile settings, and also contact us right away.

You can also close your account through the PayPal website.
If you close your PayPal account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed", but will keep your account information in our database.
==========
This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account.
However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, or as required by law.

ET CIE, S.C.A. AND CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR USE OF CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES
Q: What is a credit reference agency?
A: Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers' and businesses' credit behaviour, on behalf of financial institutions and lenders in the UK.
==========
Q: Why do you use them when I have applied to your organisation?
A: Although you have applied to us, PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l.
et Cie, S.C.A. and we will check our own records, we may also contact CRAs to get information on your, your financial and/or business associates’ and your business’ credit behaviour with other organisations.
==========
This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.
Q: Where do they get the information?
==========
A: From publicly available sources, including:
- electoral registers maintained by local authorities;
- County Court Judgments records operated by Registry Trust Limited;
- bankruptcy information held by the Insolvency Service; and
- fraud information from fraud prevention agencies.
Credit information also comes from information on applications to banks, building societies, credit card companies etc and also from the conduct of those accounts.
==========
Q: How will I know if my information is to be sent to a CRA or fraud prevention agency?
A: Organisations are only allowed to send information to CRAs and/or fraud prevention agencies with your agreement and knowledge.
==========
You will be told when you apply for Website Payments Pro or PayPal Here if your data will be supplied.
The next section of this document will tell you how, when and why we search information at CRAs and what we do with the information we obtain from them.
We will also tell you if we plan to send information on you or your business, if you have one, to CRAs.
Q: Why is my data used in this way?
==========
A: We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you, or your business, will be able to carry out your obligations to us.
We and other organisations may also use the information to check your identity.
==========
In this way we can ensure that we all make responsible decisions.
At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up-to-date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.
==========
Q: Who controls what credit reference agencies are allowed to do with my data?
A: All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by the Office of the Information Commissioner.
All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the Commissioner.
Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.
Q: Can just anyone look at my data held at credit reference agencies?
A: No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it.
Usually that will only be with your agreement or (very occasionally) if there is a legal requirement.
