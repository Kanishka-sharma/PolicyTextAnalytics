PART III.
==========
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY, AND DATA RETENTION
Processing of personal information in the US and other territories
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
Specifically, please be aware that our facilities are located in the United States, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.
This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in different countries.
However, regardless of where your data is processed we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice.
==========
European Data Transfers
If you are resident in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we will protect your personal information when it is transferred outside of your jurisdiction by: (i) processing it in a territory that provides an adequate level of protection for personal information based on the receiving country's data protection laws; and/or (ii) implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, such as requiring the recipient to comply with the Standard Contractual Clauses, or another lawful and approved transfer mechanism.
In addition, although we do not rely on the Privacy Shield Framework to lawfully receive EEA, UK or Swiss personal information in the US, we do comply with the Privacy Shield Framework for transfers of such personal information to Sift in the US (see below).
EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks
Sift complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce when we transfer personal information from the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland to our servers in the United States for processing.
Sift has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data.
Please see our Privacy Shield Notice to learn more.
==========
Security safeguards
We use technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal information we process about visitors to our Website against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
However, please note that no Internet transmission can ever be guaranteed 100% secure, and so we encourage you to take care when disclosing personal information online and to use readily available tools, such as Internet firewalls, secure email, and similar technologies to protect yourself online.
Data retention
We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements) and for a period of time consistent with the original purpose as described in this Notice.
We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information on the basis of the amount, nature, and sensitivity of your personal information processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
After expiration of the applicable retention periods, we will either delete or anonymize your personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
PART IV.

Privacy Rights.
You may authorize another person (your “agent”) to submit a request on your behalf.
