Our clients are primarily advertisers, ad agencies, Web site and app publishers, data providers, and other businesses that utilize our services.
Our technology solutions ("Technology") include programmatic advertising platforms that empower our clients with both self-serve and managed service capabilities, and include real-time bidding for media placement and analytics.
Our Technology is used by advertisers to connect with consumers.
By analyzing consumer data and targeting ad placement, we are able to optimize the performance of an ad campaign for an advertiser while providing a more relevant and meaningful online experience for consumers who view the ads we deliver.
This policy describes our privacy practices with respect to the data we collect on behalf of our clients through our Technology, as well as the information collected on our own Web site.
RUN is committed to privacy and this policy outlines the kinds of information we collect, how we collect information, how we use and disclose collected information, and how you can control, correct and/or update the information.

We support industry self-regulation and adhere to applicable industry guidelines.
RUN is a member in good standing of industry associations that establish best practices in the area of online advertising, including the Interactive Advertising Bureau ("IAB"), the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), and the Mobile Marketing Association ("MMA").
RUN adheres to the IAB Code of Conduct, the NAI Code of Conduct and the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Data Collection for Our Clients
Information We Collect
Our Technology does not collect what is generally considered Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"), which is information that can be used to uniquely identify an individual, such as your name, physical address, e-mail address, Social Security Number, credit card number, account numbers, passwords or personal health information.
As part of the process of delivering ads through our Technology, we do collect non-Personally Identifiable Information ("non-PII") about your interaction with our Technology.
Non-PII cannot be linked to a specific individual and may include information such as your device (e.g., a computer, tablet, smartphone, gaming console or smart/connected TV), the date and time of your visit, browser type, web pages visited when viewing an ad, and information about your interaction with our Technology when viewing content on your device, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (viewed a video ad to completion or clicked on an ad), and what content you viewed (which advertisement we delivered to you).
==========
For example, if you visit a number of automobile-related Web sites, you may be flagged as being interested in purchasing an automobile.
RUN also obtains non-PII such as behavioral, contextual and demographic data from third party providers that we can use to serve targeted ads.
RUN's Technology may process non-PII data points to retarget a user across multiple devices.
==========
In order to provide content-relevant ads to mobile users we may also collect carrier IDs, information about the apps you use and the location of your device if you have elected to provide that information to the publishers with whom we have partnered.
How We Collect Information
For non-PII that we collect, directly or indirectly, we typically employ the use of "pixel tags" and/or "cookies," which are commonly used on the Internet.
Pixel tags and cookies help us understand how you use a publisher's Web site and the effectiveness of an ad so that we can more accurately deliver the types of ads that are relevant to your interests.
We cannot use pixel tags or cookies to personally identify you and they do not in any way damage your operating system or files.
You can refuse cookies, but doing so may result in the receipt of the same ads or ads that do not cater to your interests.
Pixel tags are small bits of code that reside on a webpage and provide a method of information delivery allowing the operator of the page or a third party to collect information about the visitors to the page.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on the browser of your computer that assign an anonymous identifier to your browser and provide information to the cookie sender.
In addition to cookies, RUN also uses mobile identifiers such as device IDs that are specific to a user's hardware, as well as statistical methods for identifying a user across multiple devices with a high degree of accuracy.
==========
RUN also receives information from 3rd party data providers who collect and make available information such as behavioral, contextual, and demographic data, for our clients to use in targeting ads through our platform.
For example, our clients may use health-related segments such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications.
(Click here for a complete list of Health-related segments provided by 3rd party data providers that may be used in RUN's platform.)
How We Use Information Collected Through Our Technology
RUN uses non-PII it receives and collects through its Technology to tailor, target, and assess the effectiveness of the ads we deliver to you, and to avoid showing you the same ads repeatedly.
==========
Our analysis includes contextual and demographic elements, behaviors and viewing preferences, and we use this information to predict the characteristics and preferences of the viewers on sites that use our Technology.
We report this information to our advertiser clients in an aggregated, anonymous form to assist them in targeting their ad campaigns to a relevant Internet audience, and to our Web site owner clients to gain an understanding of the general make-up of individuals who visit their site(s).
Collectively, this information assists advertisers and Web site owners in delivering effective ad campaigns to their audience and allows for a more relevant and meaningful ad experience for the consumer.
==========
We may offer our clients the use of a data management platform to enable them to manage their own customer data.
Each of our client's own privacy policy governs the collection and use of this data.
However, if you opt out of our services by following the instructions below, you will also opt out of our clients' use of the data management platform to influence the types of marketing messages and other content that are displayed to you.
Data Collection from Our Company Web site
We only collect PII from our Web site when you choose to provide it to us.
For example, if you subscribe to our blog, request a demo of our Technology or submit a resume.
We use this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry.
==========
Once collected, we will maintain your PII for a reasonable time for internal business purposes.
We also collect non-PII via the site through the use of various technologies, including cookies, pixel tags and device IDs.
We use non-PII collected on our Web site for internal purposes only, such as to administer, improve and customize the Web site and to enable us to better understand how our Web site is being used by visitors in order to enhance their overall experience.
We use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Web site and to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to improve our online presence.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can adjust the preferences in the browser of your computer or device to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or to block some or all cookies.

RUN complies with the IAB Code of Conduct, the NAI Code of Conduct and the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
We believe that these codes and principles help protect and ensure individual consumer privacy.
==========
RUN uses a DAA-Approved platform to comply with the ‘Enhanced Notice' standard as dictated by the cross-industry Self-Regulation Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
As part of this service, advertisements served by RUN's platform are sometimes delivered with icons that serve as a signal to consumers that behavioral data has been used.
Through the icon, consumers can learn how their information is being used and by what companies, and access tools to control the collection and use of their information.
==========
When you opt out, we will place a cookie in your web browser that identifies you as opted-out.
Our Technology will recognize your opt out cookie and will preclude advertisers using RUN Technology from displaying targeted ads to you.
However, the choice to opt out is unique to the browser in which you set it and you may need to repeat your opt out election if you use a different computer or change browsers.
Also, the opt-out cookie cannot be set if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
Opting out does not prevent the use of cookies or similar means for purposes other than serving interest-based ads derived from your online behavior.
If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities.
==========
While you will not receive ads based on your interests derived from your online behavior, you will still see advertising, including contextual ads that are based on the content of the web page that you visit.
To learn more about interest-based advertising, and to access the opt outs of other online advertising companies, you can visit the below links of the NAI and DAA in the US:
