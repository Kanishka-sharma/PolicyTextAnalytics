TechTarget Privacy Policy
              We take your privacy very seriously.
Because we gather certain types of information about our users we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information.
This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how you can correct or change it.
==========
What information does TechTarget collect?
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services.
Because we derive revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users.
We collect personally identifiable information (which includes name, title, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address) when you provide it to us, such as when you register on one of our sites, when you subscribe for a print magazine or an e-mail newsletter, register for one of our conferences or when you register to use certain services like Webcasts, white papers, documents with LeadIQ registration or the TechTarget IT Panel.

Several of the services that we offer on our sites, such as Tips or Ask The Expert, may require registration as a condition of use.
Once you register with one of the TechTarget network of sites you are no longer anonymous to us.
We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you provided to us.
