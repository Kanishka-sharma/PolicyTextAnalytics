Sugar Publishing Privacy Policy
This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") covers all the websites owned, affiliated or operated by Sugar Publishing, Inc. ("Sugar Publishing", "we", "us", "our").
Sugar Publishing knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.
Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
By visiting the Sugar Publishing websites, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
==========
This Privacy Policy covers Sugar Publishing's treatment of personal information that Sugar Publishing gathers when you are on the Sugar Publishing websites and when you use Sugar Publishing services.
Also, this Privacy Policy covers Sugar Publishing's treatment of any personal information that Sugar Publishing's business partners share with Sugar Publishing.
This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Sugar Publishing does not own or control, or to individuals that Sugar Publishing does not employ or manage.
What Personal Information About Users Does Sugar Publishing Collect?
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve our service.
We collect the following types of information from our users:
A)  Information You Provide to Us:
We may receive and store any information you enter on our websites or provide to us in any other way.
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, such as posting comments to our websites, creating a user profile or receiving email alerts.
Registration: In order for you to use select parts of our websites or take advantage of some of Sugar Publishing's services, you must complete a registration form.
==========
As part of this registration form, we require your email address and date of birth.
Email Alerts: In order to receive an email alert every time a new story is posted on one of our websites, you are required to submit your email address.
B)   Automatic Information:

We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.
==========
Sugar Publishing may automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Sugar Publishing cookie information, and the page you requested.
Sugar Publishing uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer our websites.
Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites and its components.
This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.
This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of our websites, so we can make our websites appealing to as many users as possible.
In addition, we may provide statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our websites.
We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal Web experience.
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.
While Sugar Publishing will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
==========
C)   E-mail Communications:
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Sugar Publishing if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful.
We may also send out e-mails with news or promotions.
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at unsubscribe@sugarpublishing.com and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.
==========
D)   Information from Other Sources:
For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.
What about Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.
Sugar Publishing cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.
We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Sugar Publishing's most attractive features.
==========
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our websites (for example, advertisers).
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
Third Party cookies: We use third-party advertising companies such as TACODA to serve ads when you visit our Web site.
These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction.
We will only share personal information that is necessary for the affiliate to complete the transaction.
We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction.

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.

==========
Business Transfers:
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.
Moreover, if Sugar Publishing, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
==========
Protection of Sugar Publishing and Others:
We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Sugar Publishing, our employees, our users, or others.
Is Information About Me Secure?
If you choose to create one, your Sugar Publishing account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.
We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input.
Only Sugar Publishing employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it.
All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.
