 AGREEMENT
 These Terms of Service ("Terms of Service" or "TOS") constitute the agreement between Vonage America Inc. and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated entities ("Vonage") and the user of Vonage's communications services and any related products or services.
This agreement governs both our service and any Vonage-approved or Vonage-branded devices used with our service.
It applies to all lines on each Vonage account.
Vonage is sometimes referred to as "we,""us," "our," or "Vonage" and the user is sometimes referred to as "you," "your," "user," or "customer".
==========
By subscribing to or using our service, including those services, features or functionality provided by means of mobile applications, you agree to these Terms of Service.
All information linked to these Terms of Service is part of it.
However, from time to time, Vonage offers special or different terms and conditions for Vonage services sponsored or co-branded by Vonage business partners.
By subscribing to Vonage service under these special offers, the terms of service for such special offers shall apply and supersede these Terms of Service.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if your Vonage account is governed by a different terms of service in connection with a Vonage co-branded service offer, then any additional lines or features you add to your Vonage account will be governed by that co-branded TOS.
To the extent the co-branded TOS does not address the additional features to which you subscribe under that plan, the then-current Vonage WorldÂ® TOS will apply solely with respect to that additional feature(s).
==========
If you terminate your service under the co-branded offer and move to a different rate plan for your Vonage service, the co-branded TOS will no longer govern the provision of your Vonage service.
The terms of service for the new rate plan will apply to all your Vonage service.
The term of this agreement will be either month to month or for the term specified in the plan you select when you initiate service with us (the "Term").
The Term begins on your Order Date.
If you or we change your plan, your Term and monthly rate may change (depending on the new plan), and additional terms and conditions associated with that plan, may apply.
==========
Your acceptance of service from us constitutes your agreement with, and acceptance of, our Reasonable Use Policy and our Privacy Policy on our website at www.vonage.com.
Revisions to these Terms of Service
From time to time we may make revisions to these Terms of Service, our Reasonable Use Policy, our Privacy Policy and other policies.
We will provide notice of such revisions by posting revisions to our website, or sending an email to the email address that you provide to receive communications from us, or to your Web Account.
You agree to visit our website and your Web Account periodically and to check your email box to review any such revisions.
You also agree to notify us immediately of any changes to your email address.

By subscribing to our service, you agree that we may provide to you by use of electronic communications required notices, agreements, and other information concerning Vonage, including changes to these TOS, Reasonable Use Policy and Privacy Policy.
==========
EMERGENCY SERVICES - 911 DIALING
911 Disclosure During Subscribe
Vonage 911 service is different from traditional wire line 911 and cellular/wireless 911, but it is a safe and reliable means of emergency dialing that may differ depending on where you are located, and the device used, when using your Vonage service.
Vonage customers have access to Enhances 911 (E911), basic 911 or our national emergency call center.
When you dial 911 your Vonage phone number and registered address is sent to the local emergency center serving your location, and emergency operators have access to this information in order to send help and call you back if necessary.
With basic 911, when you dial 911, local emergency operators answering the call may not see your Vonage telephone number or your registered address.
The emergency center may not be equipped to receive, capture or retain your Vonage telephone number and registered address, so you must be prepared to give them this information.
Until you give the operator your phone number, he/she may not be able to call you back or dispatch help if the call is dropped or disconnected, or if you are unable to speak.
==========
Once local emergency centers are capable of receiving our customers'information, we automatically upgrade customers with basic 911 to E911 service.
If you do not have access to either basic 911 or E911 for any reason, your 911 call will be sent to the Vonage national emergency call center, where a trained agent will ask for your name, telephone number, and location, and then transfer you to the local emergency center nearest to your location.
We require you to provide the physical address where you will be using our service for 911 purposes.
For E911 and basic 911, this address is used to route 911 calls to your local emergency center.
When you initially provide your physical address, it can take up to 120 minutes to verify your address and activate 911 services at this address.
You will receive an email letting you know when 911 services are activated.
==========
If you move this device to another location, you must update your address.
You may register only one location at time.
If you do not update your location, your 911 calls may be sent to an emergency center near your old address.
When you update your location, it can take several hours to activate 911 services at the updated address.
You will receive an email letting you know when 911 services are activated at the updated address.
==========
If you are a Vonage ProSM customer, you have selected a service that enables you to utilize the same telephone number for two different devices.
Please note that the 911 service provided for each device is different.
For purposes of 911, you will have a primary line (i.e. a service accessed using a terminal adapter plugged into a standard, home phone), and a secondary line (i.e. a service accessed with a Vonage Companionâ¢).
The 911 service provided for the primary line will be as explained above (i.e. ENHANCED 911, BASIC, ETC).
911 calls placed over the secondary line will be sent to the national emergency call center for handling as described above.
==========
Please note that our 911 Dialing service will not function in the event of a broadband or power outage or if your broadband, Internet Service Provider (ISP), or Vonage phone service is terminated.
911 Dialing from Mobile Applications
Vonage mobile applications are not a replacement for your cellular service and you cannot make emergency (e.g., 911) calls using the software.
If you attempt to make a 911 call from the mobile application the mobile application will close and the call will be placed over your cellular carrier's network.
However, this does not prevent you from using your mobile phone for making emergency calls via your cellular provider as normal.
If you dial internationally recognized emergency service numbers while using a mobile application, the mobile application will close, the native dialer will be launched, and the call will be placed over your carrier's cellular network.
Neither your phone number nor your location will be reported to an emergency operator when dialing an internationally recognized emergency service number.
==========
CUSTOMER SERVICE
We offer varying types and levels of customer service depending on a number of factors, including the service you are using and the problems you are experiencing.
For more information on our customer service, please review the "Support" section of our web site www.vonage.com.
We assume no obligation to provide support services for any third party products or services, or for problems with our service caused by third party products or services.
Unless you have entered into a separate services agreement with us, we may change the customer service options at any time.
==========
MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
 Services Covered by the MBG and the MBG Time Period 
For Order Dates on or after February 16, 2012, a money back guarantee ("MBG") applies to your first voice line only (not to additional or secondary lines) if you terminate your service within thirty (30) calendar days from your Order Date.
The Order Date is the date you order service or the date we successfully process your payment, whichever is later.
It is not the day you receive the equipment you ordered or the first day you use the service.
If multiple lines are ordered at the same time as part of the initial order or at any time within the MBG period, only the initial voice line will be eligible for the MBG.
Terms of 30 day MBG 
We will refund or credit (i) the activation fee you paid on the first line; (ii) the service charge you paid for the first service term; (iii) any shipping fees and taxes you paid for your initial device.
==========
We do not provide refunds for any devices (or associated taxes) purchased from retail stores.
Please refer to the return policy of the retailer where you purchased your device to determine whether, and under what conditions, you may obtain a refund of any paid activation fee, 1st month service charge, fees and certain taxes.
Our money back guarantee does not apply to any charges for international usage, payphone calls to Vonage toll free numbers, directory assistance and any features or services not expressly included in your monthly plan fee.
In addition, we may not be able to refund all of the taxes that you paid.
Charges for usage, services, and features outside of your plan are separately billed and charged to your payment method shortly after cancellation.
If you have a billing dispute following the termination of your account, please contact us at http://www.vonage.com/contactus.php.
==========
Right to Revoke 
We have the right to discontinue or revoke our thirty (30) day MBG at any time, without prior notice.
Restrictions Applicable to Certain Promotions, including MBG Promotions 
Certain plans may have restrictions or limitations that apply to the refund of calls made during the MBG period from certain US territories or foreign jurisdictions, to the United States, or in the event the Reasonable Use Policy is violated.
For these plans, the customer may be responsible for a per-call/per-use charge that will not be refunded in the event of cancellation during the applicable promotional or MBG period.
==========
SERVICE
 Service Distinctions 
Our service may be subject to different regulatory treatment than traditional voice telecommunications service.
This treatment may limit or otherwise affect your rights of redress before regulatory agencies.
Our service requires high speed broadband or, for certain mobile applications, a WIFI or other data connection (e.g. 3G/4G) which we do not provide.
Certain of our other services may be used with devices such as wireless telephones, mobile telephones, smart phones, PDA's, tablets or pads which we may or may not provide.
Events beyond our control may affect our service, such as power outages, fluctuations in the Internet, your underlying ISP or broadband service, system maintenance or acts of God.
We will act in good faith using commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions to your use of and access to our service.
==========
Residential and Mobile Use of Service and Device  
Vonage's service is a single (and not extended or multi-) family residential voice service.
It is engineered to process and deliver traffic profiles and utilization levels of our typical residential customers' calling patterns (also referred to as "normal use" by residential plan customers).
"Typical" refers to the calling patterns of at least 95% of our customers on a particular calling plan.
Normal residential traffic profiles and utilization may arise from business, multiple or extended family, community or fraudulent use.
"Unlimited" does not refer to those types and levels of usage.
Telephone utilization that is indicative of, or arising from, impermissible business, multiple family, community or fraudulent use, as outlined herein, on a residential class of service line may create network congestion that will manifest itself in increased busy signals for themselves and others.
==========
Vonage's residential unlimited service plans and features are for single (and not extended or multi-) family residential (or personal, non-commercial) or co-branded use only.
Co-branded use is defined as Vonage service that is provided by a third party partner under that third party partner's marketing brand, with or without reference to Vonage.
This means that only the account holder, residential family members (as defined below), and those Extensions Â® phone number(s) registered with Vonage by the account holder may use Vonage's residential unlimited service plans.
"Residential family members" refer to those members of your immediate family who reside in your personal residence - e.g., spouse, domestic partner, parents and/or children.
If your residential service plan allows you to extend the service or feature(s) to another residential or mobile number, all use under that service plan is aggregated and must conform to single (and not extended or multi-) family residential (or personal, non-commercial) or co-branded use.
Some Vonage plans allow for the use of additional devices (such as personal computers, mobile phones, ExtensionsÂ® phone number(s) registered with Vonage or other Vonage equipment) outside the residence as part of that service plan.
==========
If you subscribe to a service plan which permits use of more than one device with the same voice line, your usage will be aggregated and assessed in accordance with our Reasonable Use Policy.
Vonage's mobile unlimited service plans and features are for normal, personal non-commercial use and are device specific.
Use of Vonage's unlimited mobile plans must be in accordance with the Reasonable Use Policy and these Terms of Service, and consistent with other typical customers on the same mobile calling plan.
Unauthorized or excessive use beyond that normally experienced by typical mobile customers on the same plan may cause busy signals and may result in service termination.
==========
Small Business Plans


If you subscribe to any of Vonage's small business plans, including one of our Small Office Home Office ("SoHo") plans, we provide service, features and certain equipment to you solely for use as a small business user or domestic business traveler.
Some Vonage plans allow for the use of additional devices (such as personal computers, mobile phones or other Vonage equipment) as part of these service plans.
If you subscribe to a service plan which permits use of more than one device with the same voice line, your usage will be aggregated and assessed in accordance with our Reasonable Use Policy.
The following uses are not considered small business uses and are not permitted under small business plans: autodialing; continuous or excessive call-forwarding or conferencing; inbound/outbound centralized or distributed call center activity; telemarketing of any kind (including, but not limited to, charitable or political solicitation or polling); fax or voicemail broadcasting; and fax or voicemail blasting.
See Section 10 for more details.
==========
Certain business plans may require you to be responsible for supplying, operating, and supporting the standard SIP-based Customer Premise Equipment for use with the service.
As the subscriber and operator or administrator of this equipment, you are responsible for maintaining the security of the equipment,including but not limited to the physical and network security elements of your equipment, and any and all charges related thereto.
Some business plans may not be eligible for certain promotional offers.
==========
Use of Vonage's small and home business unlimited service plans and features must be in accordance with the Reasonable Use Policy and these Terms of Service, and consistent with typical customers on the same small or home business calling plan (also called "normal use" by small and home business plan customers).
Unauthorized or excessive use beyond that normally experienced by typical small or home business customers may create network congestion that will manifest itself in increased busy signals for themselves and others, and may result in service termination.
Inconsistent with Normal Use 
If you use the service, any feature and/or any device (including, but not limited to, your personal computer(s), mobile phone(s) or Vonage equipment) in a way that is inconsistent with the normal use for your service, feature or plan, you will be required, at Vonage's sole discretion, to (a) pay the rates for the service, feature or plan that would apply to the way you used the service, feature or device, (b) change to a more appropriate plan or (c) terminate the plan.
For example, if you subscribe to one of our residential service plans, and your aggregate usage is inconsistent with normal residential or personal use, you may thereafter be required to pay our applicable, higher rates for service for all periods in which your use of our service or the device was inconsistent with normal residential use.
==========
Unlimited voice services are provided primarily for continuous live dialogue between two individuals.
Lack of continuous dialogue activity, unusual calling patterns, excessive conferencing or call forwarding, excessive numbers dialed and/or consistent excessive usage (which may also apply to features such as Directory Assistance) will be considered indicators that your use may be inconsistent with normal use by other Vonage customers aggregating their usage under a similar service plan, or that impermissible use as set forth in Section 10 and/or in the Reasonable Use Policy may be occurring and may trigger an account review or further action by us.
A non-exhaustive list of examples of uses of our service that are generally considered to be impermissible and inconsistent with normal residential or co-branded use, include, but are not limited to, use: 

By or for others who do not live with you; 
By others who are not registered Vonage ExtensionsÂ® users; or 
Operating a business, even if operating from the residence.
A non-exhaustive list of examples of uses of our service that are generally considered to be impermissible and inconsistent with either single (and not extended or multi-) family residential or small or home business use, or co-branded use, include, but are not limited to, use: 

Operating any other enterprise, including not-for-profit or governmental;
 Operating a call center; 
 Resale to others; 
 Auto-dialing or fax/voice blasts; 
 Telemarketing; or 
Without live dialogue, including as a monitor, intercom or for transcription.
Vonage evaluates customer usage in comparison to similarly situated customers, e.g., residential use under residential service plans or small business use under small business service plans or affiliate use under co-branded service offers or plans.
==========
For example, over ninety five per cent (95%) of Vonage's residential unlimited calling plan customers use less than three thousand (3000) minutes per month and do not have any unusual calling patterns.
We may conclude that a customer's aggregate usage is outside of normal use if it exceeds 3000 minutes per month IN COMBINATION with one or more of the following,including, but not limited to, excessive: 
 Number of unique numbers called; 
Call lengths; 
Frequency of call forwarding/transferring; 
Conference calling; 
Excessive calls to conference bridges; 
Short duration calls or chats; 
Calls made during business hours; 
 Number of calls terminated and re-initiated consecutively, which, in the aggregate, result in excessive call lengths during a specific time frame; or  Other abnormal calling patterns indicative of an attempt to evade enforcement of these Terms of Service and our Reasonable Use Policy.
Vonage may also determine that abnormal, unreasonable or impermissible usage is occurring, and may take appropriate steps described below even if the number of minutes used is not excessive, when a customer's calling patterns during more than one month reflect excessive: 
Unique numbers called; 
Call lengths; 
Frequency of call forwarding/transferring; 
Conference calling; 
Short duration calls; 
 Number of calls terminated and re-initiated consecutively, which, in the aggregate, result in excessive call lengths during a specific time frame;  Other abnormal calling patterns indicative of an attempt to evade enforcement of these Terms of Service and our Reasonable Use Policy, or  at a multi-residential address for more than one single residence.
Vonage may take appropriate steps to enforce these Terms of Service and our Reasonable Use Policy.
==========
We reserve the right to review your account and take further action, including, but not limited to, immediate suspension of your Vonage service if account usage is beyond normal standards, impermissible or detrimental to other customers' ability to use the service or adversely affects our operations.
We may assess abnormal usage based on comparisons to the usage patterns and levels of our other customers.
If we determine that you are engaging in abnormal or impermissible usage, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform you and provide you with the opportunity to correct the improper usage.
If we give you the opportunity to correct your abnormal usage patterns and you fail to immediately conform to normal use, we may exercise our right to transfer your service to a more appropriate plan, charge applicable rates or suspend or terminate your service.
You acknowledge that if your service is terminated under this provision, you are subject to all applicable fees and taxes at the time your service is terminated.
Vonage's right to terminate your account under Section 6(E) (with or for no reason) is not limited by this provision.
No O+ or Operator Assisted Calling; May Not Support x11 Calling 
 Our service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling, including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls.
Our service may not support 311, 511, and other x11 services in one or more service areas.
Our service may support specified dialing such as 911 and 411, although certain mobile applications may not provide such dialing services.
411 charges may vary by plan.
==========
No Directory Listing 
 The phone numbers you get from us will not be listed by us in any telephone directories.
However, any phone numbers you transfer from your local phone company may be or remain listed.
We have no control over directory listings.
==========

==========

Certain applications may permit you to extend use of such application to others using your password information.
You agree to keep all passwords and account information confidential and are solely responsible for any liability or damages resulting from your failure to maintain that confidentiality and for all activities that occur under your password, including without limitation usage by others.

Disconnection by You.
If you attempt to disconnect service for one or more of your lines before the end of your current service term, you will be responsible for all the charges for your current term that are applicable to the disconnected line(s), including unbilled charges, plus an Early Termination Fee per line, if applicable, as provided in Section 8(G) below.
Cancellation is effective on the date you or we cancel or which you designate as the cancellation date (future disconnection date).
Annual prepayment plan charges are not subject to refund.
If your service is cancelled before the end of your billing cycle for any reason by you or us, there are no pro-rated refunds.
==========
Charges for any overages, payphone calls to Vonage toll free numbers, and out-of-plan international calls or any other features and services outside your rate plan are separately billed and charged to your selected payment method after cancellation.
In addition, if you obtain a product or service from us (e.g., a phone Adapter) for which a rebate or benefit was given to you that was conditioned on maintaining your Vonage service for a specified length of time, and you disconnect service before the end of that period, you agree to pay us the applicable recovery fee and/or Early Termination Fee.
See Section 8(H) below.
==========
On multiple line accounts, any Early Termination Fee arising from a cancellation of a line that is subject to an ETF must either be paid upon cancellation or the remaining ETF balance may be transferred to one of the other lines on that account.
Such ETF balance continues on the account until either the ETF obligation has expired or been satisfied.
Disconnection by Vonage with a Reason.
If we discontinue service generally, or disconnect your service without a stated reason, you will only be responsible for the charges that have accrued through the date of the disconnection, including a pro-rated portion of the final service term charges, and, if applicable, any recovery and Early Termination Fees.

If we disconnect your service for any of the reasons listed in section 6.4 above, you will be responsible for all charges through the end of your current service term, including unbilled charges, plus any applicable disconnection, Early Termination Fees and any recovery fees.
All Charges Owed at the Time of Disconnection will be Immediately Payable.
At the time of disconnection, we will immediately charge the credit or debit card you have provided to us for payment, or initiate an electronic funds transfer if that is your payment method, for all amounts due at that time.
We will pursue collection for unpaid amounts on disconnected accounts and may report these unpaid charges to credit bureaus.
==========
Service Disconnection on Number Transfer or "Port"
Single Line Accounts.

==========
We will terminate our service in this fashion even if you have not independently called us to request disconnection.
Once your service is terminated in this manner, you will remain responsible for all charges and fees through the end of the current billing cycle, including any unbilled charges, as well as for any applicable Early Termination Fees or recovery fees that may be applicable as provided in Sections *(G) and 8(H) below.
If a port is unsuccessful for any reason, then unless you independently call us to request disconnection or unless we determine to disconnect your line as stated in these Terms of Service, your service and your agreement with us will not terminate, you will remain a Vonage customer, and you will continue to be responsible for all charges and fees associated with your Vonage service.
Multi Line Accounts.
If you request your new service provider to port a number from us and you have multiple numbers assigned to your account and/or additional devices you are required to inform us by calling as specified in Section 6(H), of your intent to terminate all the services on your account, prior to the successful completion of the requested port or we will select the most appropriate billing plan for any remaining numbers and/or devices on your Vonage account, and you will continue to be responsible for all the charges and fees associated with the remaining services on your Vonage account.
