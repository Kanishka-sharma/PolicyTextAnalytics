LiquidM Network Privacy Policy
This policy only applies to our advertising network, where you are delivered adverts.
About the LiquidM network.
We partner with third-party web site publishers and mobile app developers to serve ads on their sites and their apps.
These ads are selected based on the user’s geographic location, device information, their use of other sites or apps integrated with our partners or the LiquidM network, and information provided to us about the user by publishers and developers.
We enable our partnering publishers and developers to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to their users, often using advertising revenues they generate to offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost.
Information we collect
When you use an app or web site integrated with the LiquidM network, we may collect information about you and your use of the web site or app.
This information cannot be used to identify you in real life but it does enable us to recognise your device when you use sites or apps that have partnered with us.
We may collect:
Information you give us
You may give us information by signing up on our web site, answering questions on your device from us or our partners (e.g. questionnaires)
We collect some or all of the following information about your device:
Information about your device
device type (e.g. smartphone, tablet, etc.)
operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry)
network provider
which mobile browser you use (e.g. Safari, Google Chrome etc.)
the carrier user ID (a number uniquely allocated to you by your network provider)
the geo-location of your device (using GPS or other geo-location data)
numbers uniquely identifying your device (e.g. MAC address, manufacturer’s unique device identifier)
Information about ads you have been served
the details of the ad delivered (e.g. advertiser’s name, type of advert, etc)
the web site or the app where the ad was delivered
your interaction with the ad (i.e. whether you clicked, hid, muted or otherwise interacted with the ad)
whether you performed certain actions after clicking on the ad (e.g. downloading an application, making a purchase, etc
How we use information we collect
We use the information we collect to display interest-based advertising customised to individuals’ inferred interests, preferences and locations, and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and technologies.
==========
The information we collect also helps us to provide filtering options for publishers and developers to manage ads appearing on their sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for advertisers.
This helps our publishers and developer clients, for example, not to present you ads that you have already seen, and helps our advertiser clients serve adverts that are most likely to be of interest to you.
Who we share information with
With Publishers, Developers and Advertisers
We share information we collect about you with our publisher, developer and advertiser partners as well as technology partners who we use to provide our services.
==========
We scramble (one-way hashing) uniquely identifiable information before sharing it.
This allows us to identify your device only for the purposes of providing our service and prevents your information being used to identify you in real life.
Sharing Information with other Third Parties
From time to time, we may need to disclose your information to third parties such as to law enforcement authorities or our legal advisers, where it is necessary to comply with the law or regulation; enforce or apply our user terms and conditions; to protect our rights, or to preserve the safety of our users.
==========
This may include exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection.
We may also share your personal information in connection with any merger, a sale of LiquidM assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
Whenever we share your personal information for this reason we will ensure that the recipient is bound by all appropriate confidentiality obligations and that it commits to using your personal information only for the purposes for which you originally provided it.
==========
Cookies
A cookie is a short alphanumeric sequence stored on your device, which can be used to track your individual usage of a web site.
The sequence within a cookie cannot be used to identify you in real life.
We use cookies in order to serve more relevant ads to you and to track your interaction with our clients’ web sites, apps and ads.
We may collect certain reporting information, such as the type of device, the location where you were served the ad, the format of the ad and your interaction with ads.
