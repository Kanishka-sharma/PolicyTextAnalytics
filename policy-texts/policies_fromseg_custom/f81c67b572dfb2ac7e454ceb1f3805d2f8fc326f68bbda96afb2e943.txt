Security
Our Commitment to Data Security
We have appropriate physical, electronic and procedural security safeguards
            to protect and secure the information we collect 
Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)
target.com uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal 
              credit information, including your credit card number, before it 
              travels over the Internet.
SSL technology is the industry standard 
              for secure online transactions.
Because we use SSL, placing an order 
              online at target.com is just as safe as giving your credit card 
              number over the phone.
The law protects you, too
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing 
              and using your credit card number.
In addition, consumer protection 
              laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card.
Under federal law, if someone steals your credit card or your credit 
              card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much 
              the thief charges to your account.
Our Safe Shopping Guarantee
When you shop at target.com, you are protected by our Safe Shopping 
             Guarantee: If your credit card information is stolen because you 
             used your credit card to make an online purchase from target.com, 
             we'll make sure you don't have to pay any fraudulent charges made 
             to your account.
Here's how it works: 
If fraudulent charges are made to your credit card, you must notify 
                your credit card company in accordance with its rules and procedures.
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card company cannot 
                make you pay more than $50 of the fraudulent charges.
==========
If your credit card company makes you pay any part of this $50, then target.com 
                will reimburse you, up to the full $50.
Of course, we will do 
                so only if the unauthorized use of your credit card number occurred 
                because you used it to purchase something online through target.com 
                and only if you properly notified your credit card company.
If you have questions regarding our Safe Shopping Guarantee, call 1-888-304-4000
     		or contact us.
