==========
The domain service contracts for ccTLDs and gTLDs (the 'Domain Service Contracts') are contracts between Melbourne IT or another accredited registrar and you, and not between Microsoft and you.
The Domain Service Contracts apply to the registration, renewal and transfer of your domain name.
==========
Your use of the domain name is also subject to the policies of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ('ICANN').
These policies include the ICANN Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy located at http http://www.icann.org/udrp/#udrp.
==========
Microsoft does not control the availability of any domain name you seek to register or renew.
You represent and warrant that any domain name you register, renew or transfer through the service and Melbourne IT will not infringe the rights of third parties.
==========
Public registry.
You understand that your contact information, such as your name, postal address, phone number and e‑mail address, will be collected by Melbourne IT and placed in a public registry.
==========
Termination of service.
Except during the first five days after you subscribe to the service, if you or we cancel your service, your domain name will remain registered for its current annual term.
==========
However, it will no longer work with the service.
It will not work with your e‑mail service or point to your web site.
You will be responsible for renewing and paying the applicable renewal fee for your domain name after you or we cancel your service.

Microsoft Points.
Microsoft Points is a service under which you can acquire Points and redeem those Points for certain online services and digital products.
You can see how many Points you have by checking your Points balance at https://billing.microsoft.com.
==========
You can obtain selected services or digital products that we elect to offer in exchange for Points.
You can do this by redeeming your Points as indicated in the particular messaging you see for those offers.
==========
You can acquire Points in a variety of ways.
For example, you can purchase Points, or certain services may give you Points for using the service or specific features of the service (also known as 'promotion Points').
You can earn promotion Points only for actions you actually complete.
==========
You are responsible for any tax consequences that may result from your participation in the Points service.
When you obtain Points, you have obtained a limited license to a digital product.
==========
Points have no monetary value.
You may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for Points, regardless of how you acquired those Points.
Points are not your personal property.
==========
Your only recourse for using Points is to obtain the specific online services or digital products that we offer for Points redemption.
We may further restrict your Points redemption offers based on your country of residence.
We encourage you to redeem your Points.
The existence of a particular offer available for Points redemption is not a commitment by us to maintain or continue to make the offers in the future.
The scope, variety and type of online services and digital products that you may obtain by redeeming Points can change at any time.
We have no obligation to continue making offers available for Points redemption.
Promotion Points may expire at any time, as set forth in the messages related to that promotion.
==========
We may cancel, suspend or otherwise limit your access to your Points balance if we suspect fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity on your Points balance.
Once we delete Points from a balance, we will not reinstate them, except at our discretion.
When we cancel, suspend or otherwise limit access to your Points balance, your right to use your Points balance immediately ceases.
We will use reasonable efforts to investigate Points balances that are subject to access limitations and to reach a final decision on the limitations promptly.
In addition, we may limit your use of the Points service, including applying limits to: the number of Points you may have credited to your Points balance at one time, the number of Points you may redeem within a given time period (for example, one day), and the number of promotion Points you may obtain in a single event.
==========
If we post Points to your balance for an activity that is subsequently voided, canceled or involves a returned item, then we will remove those Points from your balance.
You must ensure that we properly post your Points to your Points balance.
If you believe that you have validly acquired Points that we have not posted to your Points balance, we will not consider posting these Points unless you contact us within 12 months after the date you claimed to have acquired those Points.
We may require reasonable documentation to support your claim.

Bing cashback.
You can participate in the Bing cashback service if you are 18 years or older, reside in the United States and satisfy the requirements described in this contract and at the Bing cashback web site (http://bing.com/cashback).
Bing cashback is a service for you to accumulate savings for making qualifying purchases from participating stores.
These savings may be redeemed later only when requested from within the United States via the payment instrument that you select for your cashback account, subject to minimum payout of $5.
We rely on participating online stores to report purchases to us.
Stores may not report your purchase to us if they determine that your purchase did not qualify for cashback savings because you did not comply with this contract or additional terms disclosed on the store's site, or if the store determines that you were not referred to the store by Bing cashback.
We may also disqualify reported purchases based on our own determination that you have not complied with this contract or the terms disclosed on the store's site.
Please review the exclusions carefully.
==========
You may earn up to Two Thousand Five Hundred U.S. Dollars ($2,500.00) of cashback savings in a calendar year, calculated based on when the participating store reports your purchases to us.
You may earn cashback savings on purchases that you complete in the same web browsing session (not to exceed 24 hours) after clicking on advertisements or listings in the Bing service or the Bing cashback service.
Eligible advertisements will be marked with the Bing cashback logo.
You will not earn cashback savings on purchases where (a) you close your browser or open the store's web site in a different web browser or tab; (b) you click away from the store after clicking on an eligible advertisement; (c) your browser is not configured to accept cookies; (d) the purchase is not completed in the same web browsing session in which you click on the eligible advertisement or listing; (e) the order is later cancelled or the goods or services are later returned; (f) the store does not report the purchase to us; (g) the goods or services are acquired for resale or other business purposes; (h) you use a separate discount or coupon with your order; (i) you exceed the annual monetary cap on cashback savings; (j) you purchase gift cards or gift certificates; or (k)  you make a purchase from yourself or from entities that you control or otherwise in collusion with other people.
==========
There may be additional or different limitations on purchases at certain stores, and those limitations will be disclosed on the store's site.
Your participation in the Bing cashback service on such online stores will be subject to this contract as well as any additional terms and conditions disclosed on the store's site.
In the event of a conflict between any of this contract and those terms and conditions disclosed on the store's site, the ones disclosed on the store's site will apply and control.
To participate in the service you must set up a Bing cashback cashback account at https://cashbackaccount.bing.com/cashback/welcome.aspx by providing all of the required registration information.
==========
You must keep this account information up to date, accurate and secure.
You may not barter, trade or otherwise exchange your account or maintain more than one account.
==========
We will describe the Bing cashback savings available for associated qualifying purchases.
Participating stores are responsible for reporting qualifying purchases (and related returns, refunds and/or coupon use) to us.
Within two days after a qualifying purchase is reported to us, we will list the purchase in your account with a status of 'pending.'
The purchase will stay in pending status for a period of up to 60 days (although for certain stores, the period can extend up to 90 days) to account for returns, refunds, fraud and other processing issues.
After this point, if the purchase is eligible for savings, it will be marked as 'available' in your account and the associated savings will be eligible for redemption as described below.
==========
You must ensure that we properly post savings to your account.
If you believe that you have earned savings that are not posted to your account, we will not consider posting them to your account unless you contact us within six months after the date of the associated purchase.
==========
We may require reasonable documentation to support your claim.
Bing cashback savings have no monetary value until the associated purchases are approved and you make a proper redemption request.
==========
You may request redemptions from your account, subject to then-current minimum redemption requirements.
Redemptions for cash payments are subject to section 24 above.
==========
There may be additional limitations for redeeming savings on purchases from certain stores, and those limitations will be disclosed on the store site.
We may offer additional redemption options.
==========
You are responsible for any tax liability from your participation in the service.
We may disqualify transactions, reverse previously paid cashback savings, refuse redemptions and/or close your account at any time if you participate in any fraud or abuse relating to the service (including, without limitation, conducting 'sham' transactions or otherwise colluding with merchants), make any misrepresentation in connection with your participation in the service, maintain multiple accounts or do not otherwise comply with this contract.
If you receive your cashback savings into your PayPal account, we may request that PayPal debit from your PayPal account the amounts we paid to you if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you should not have received the cashback savings for any of the reasons stated in this contract or any other agreement related to your eligibility for cashback savings.
You authorize PayPal to honor our request to debit the amount of the cashback savings from your PayPal account.
==========
We also may close your account if it has been inactive for 12 months (i.e., no qualifying purchases or redemption of savings during the 12-month period).
Accrued but unredeemed Bing cashback savings in accounts that are closed will be returned to Microsoft.
We may share your information with stores and our business partners in the cashback program in order to help us address customer support and other issues related to your participation in the cashback program.
After each purchase you make, the store you purchase from will send us your purchase information, which we will use to process your cashback.
This information, plus the other information you provide when creating an account and using cashback is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement, available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=74170.
Advertisers, participating stores and service providers for the Bing cashback service, while beneficiaries of the disclaimers and limitations of liability in sections 13 and 14 above, have no obligations to you for the service or under this contract.
