This information does not identify you personally.
We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:
The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain), and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website

Links to Other Sites
Our Website has links to other federal agencies and to private organizations.
Once you link to another site, it is that site's privacy policy that controls what it collects about you.
==========
Information Collected When You Send Us an E-mail Message
When inquiries are E-mailed to us, we again store the text of your message and E-mail address information, so that we can answer the question that was sent in, and send the answer back to the E-mail address provided.
If enough questions or comments come in that are the same, the question may be added to our Question and Answer section, or the suggestions are used to guide the design of our Web site.
==========
We do not retain the messages with identifiable information or the e-mail addresses for more than 10 days after responding unless your communication requires further inquiry.
If you send us an e-mail message in which you ask us to do something that requires further inquiry on our part, there are a few things you should know.
The material you submit may be seen by various people in our Department, who may use it to look into the matter you have inquired about.
If we do retain it, it is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, which restricts our use of it, but permits certain disclosures.
Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.
If your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information, you might want to send it by postal mail instead.
