This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction and agree to otherwise keep the information confidential.
Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
==========
Cookies: Our websites employ cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on Boston.com and Boston Globe Services, as well as to track site usage.
For detailed information about our use of cookies see our Frequently Asked Questions about Cookies.
Boston.com uses a commercial advertising server to display ads on our site and we use cookies to manage the display and frequency of advertisements that we sell and/or serve.
==========
We also reserve the right to place a New York Times Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.
Information Collected by Third Parties using Technology:
Some of the services and advertisements on certain of our Web sites (including Boston.com) are delivered or served by third-party companies that may place or recognize cookies or Web Beacon to track certain non-personally identifiable information about our Web site users.
For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, some advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, in order to collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Web sites and other Web sites.
==========
In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other Web sites.
We do not have access to, nor control over, advertisers’ or service providers' cookies or how they may be used.
Please click here to see a list of third parties that may be using cookies to serve advertising on our Web sites.
For example, Google is one of the companies that serves advertisements onto Boston.com.

==========
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users.
For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service.
The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
==========
Please keep in mind that we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs.

If this information is to be shared with a third party other than the New England Media Group we will notify you at the time of collection.
If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest, or special offer.
Occasionally, the New England Media Group will run contests that registered members can enter by posting on the forums.
Winners of some of these contests may be contacted for prize fulfillment purposes at the e-mail addresses provided while registering for the site.
If winners are to be contacted in this manner, it will be stated in the contest rules.
If you do not want to be contacted, you may always decline to participate in the contest.
Special Events and Promotions: We often receive contact information regarding customers who may also attend Special Events and Promotions.
Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection.
Online Customer Panels: We offer readers and customers the opportunity to participate in online research panels.
These customers agree to participate in periodic surveys about their usage of products produced by The New England Media Group, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior.
Panel members are primarily contacted via e-mail, but may occasionally be contacted by telephone or postal mail.
All survey data is reported/used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released.
As a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address only; name, home address and telephone number are optional.

Market Research and User Surveys: Reader surveys and market research are valuable tools that help us better respond to consumer needs and opinions and help shape our product offerings.
Our websites may collect additional personal information from members in connection with optional reader surveys and market research activities.
Information that you provide to answer optional survey or market research questions may be shared, in aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
==========
Globe Reader: 
The Boston Globe currently uses Google Analytics, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our GlobeReader users.
We use this information to track the application's traffic, usability, performance, and effectiveness.
==========
We reserve the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding our online visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.
Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers in aggregate.
==========
Mobile Messaging Service:
Boston.com uses the information collected from your interaction with Boston.com by Real Estate and Search Text Messaging Service (SMS) (“SMS Service”) solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service.
The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent.
==========
Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.
Boston.com collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and Boston.com.
When you send a text message to Boston.com or via Boston.com, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction.
The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services.
Boston.com uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service.
What do we do with the information we track?
==========
Site Login: Your e-mail address acts as your member login, and together with the password that you create during the registration process your e-mail address allows you to access many of the features and services available on our websites.
Boston.com and the Boston Globe Services website will share your e-mail address and password with each other in order to allow you to use the same login and password on each of the these sites.
This means that you will be able to move back and forth on our websites without having to create a new membership account or remember a separate password for each site.
==========
Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising: Our websites may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site and to provide advertisers with information on how many consumers have seen or clicked their advertising banners.
We also use demographic information to target advertising, in aggregate, to the users who will most likely be interested.
This means that users see advertising that is likely to be relevant, and advertisers send their messages to people who are likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads.
In both statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.
==========
Boston.com E-Mail Newsletters: During the Boston.com registration process, you will have the opportunity to subscribe to periodic e-mail newsletters.
You may also sign up to receive e-mails at any time by accessing your profile in the Member Center section.
We send both editorial e-mail newsletters and messages about services offered by The New England Media Group and its partners and advertisers.

If you experience difficulty with the unsubscribe process, feel free to contact us at feedback@boston.com and provide all possible e-mail addresses along with the name of the newsletter from which you would like to unsubscribe.
You may also send a blank message to the @unsub.
boston.com e-mail address towards the bottom of the newsletter you would like to opt out from, and you will automatically be removed.
Both the subject line and the body of the e-mail may be left blank.
If your personally identifiable information or email address changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update it at the Boston.com Member Center.
==========
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
==========
If we decide to make changes in our email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
