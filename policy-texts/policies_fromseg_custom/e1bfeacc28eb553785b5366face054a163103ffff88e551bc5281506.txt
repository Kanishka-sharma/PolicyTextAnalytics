SunTrust Privacy Protection: Our Commitment to You
At SunTrust, we recognize the sensitive nature of your financial information, and take appropriate precautions to protect your privacy.
When you entrust us with this information, you can be certain it will be used only within our strict guidelines.
SunTrust, along with most other financial institutions who do business in the United States, is required to provide our customers with a document illustrating the types of customer information we collect and the circumstances under which we may share it.
This brochure describes those practices for all members of the SunTrust corporate family including Alexander Key Investments, Asset Management Advisors, LLC, and First Mercantile Trust Company.
View a complete listing of the firms in the SunTrust Banks, Inc. corporate family.
==========
We hope you will read through all the details of SunTrust's official position on privacy.
Importantly, we want you to understand that SunTrust uses information responsibly to:
Provide you with the services you've requested.
Offer you other financial products and services.
Make doing business with SunTrust more convenient for you.
SunTrust will not trade, rent or sell your personal information to anyone.
We will not provide account or personal information to non-SunTrust companies for the purpose of independent telemarketing or direct mail marketing of any non-financial products or services.
Only in extremely limited circumstances, outlined below, do we share your information with other financial services firms for marketing purposes.
This policy statement takes the place of any previous privacy policies issued by SunTrust Banks, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries.
If, in addition to federal law, you are protected by specific state or local regulations concerning information sharing, SunTrust will fully comply with those regulations as well.
==========
If you apply for a loan or a new account: We ask you to provide information about your financial status, such as employment, income, monthly expenses and assets, as well as identifying information such as your address, telephone number and Social Security number.
In most cases, you give us this information yourself, in person, by mail, or through a web site.
If we need to know about your credit and repayment history, we also obtain information from consumer reporting agencies and other creditors.
If you apply for insurance:
We ask you to provide information relevant to underwriting the specific insurance product.
This information, such as information about your health or driving record, is not used for any purpose other than to provide the service and insurance applied for.
Once you become a customer:
We maintain information about your transactions including account balances, securities holdings and repayment history.
==========
Because it's important to know what types of services may be most valuable to you, we obtain statistics and demographic information about current and prospective customers from marketing information firms.
The information we collect is used to help us deliver the services you've requested, easily and efficiently.
It may also permit us to design and offer specific products and services that we believe will be useful to you and other customers.
==========
Within SunTrust:
SunTrust employees are permitted access to the information they need to perform their jobs on your behalf.
We maintain strict internal policies against unauthorized disclosure or use of customer information by employees.
SunTrust has a number of subsidiaries offering a wide variety of services such as mortgage banking, securities brokerage, insurance sales, leasing, consumer finance and many others.
As permitted by law, information held by any SunTrust subsidiary is available to other members of the SunTrust corporate family for authorized purposes, unless a customer has specifically requested otherwise.
==========
(See "How to limit information sharing and marketing.")
SunTrust Credit Cards:
SunTrust and MBNA America Bank, N.A. (which is not a SunTrust affiliate) have a joint marketing agreement to offer, endorse and sponsor the SunTrust credit card issued by MBNA.
In order to offer credit cards to our customers, it is important that we exchange certain customer information with MBNA.
This may include:
Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, Social Security number, assets or income.
Information about your transactions with SunTrust, such as your account balance or payment history.
Information obtained from specialized marketing information firms, such as household statistics.
Information from credit bureaus regarding your previous credit performance.
==========
MBNA has agreed to strictly safeguard the confidentiality of this customer information, and they are not permitted to share it with anyone else without our permission.
Customers may request that SunTrust not share their information with MBNA.
(See "How to limit information sharing and marketing.")
Companies that you ask us to share with:
From time to time, we will make available the services of other financial firms, such as homeowner's insurance coverage for SunTrust mortgage applicants.
==========
In these cases, SunTrust will get your permission prior to sharing your information with the outside firm.
SunTrust may get your written, online or verbal permission to share your information.
If you grant permission, it will apply only to the specific program or programs you consent to.
If you have previously requested that we block the sharing of your information, that request will remain in place for all other situations.
==========
Outside service providers:
We have arrangements with companies whose experience is essential for our own services to operate properly.
For example, we work with firms that execute securities transactions, enable online banking, and make account statements possible for SunTrust customers.
SunTrust also works with companies that assist us in marketing our own products and services.
==========
For example, these firms may perform direct mail fulfillment or conduct surveys on our web site.
These companies perform their functions at SunTrust's direction and we only share customer information that is necessary for them to perform these functions.
As with all our business partners, these companies are required to safeguard your information and only use it for authorized purposes, and within the guidelines established by SunTrust for the protection of customer information.
==========
Consumer reporting agencies (credit bureaus):
It is standard banking industry practice and within federal and state law for SunTrust to routinely provide data about customer loan repayment and transactions to these agencies and other creditors.
We may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus.
Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account(s) may be reflected in your credit report.
==========
Courts and government bodies:
Certain federal and state laws may require us to share information about you.
For example, if you are involved in a legal matter with a third party, we may be ordered to provide information to a court or other party.
In these circumstances, only the specific information required by law, subpoena, or court order will be shared.
==========
We may share information about former customers with SunTrust affiliates, marketing partners and other third parties as described above.
However, former customers can also elect not to have their information shared, even after their relationship with us ends.
If you prefer, you may direct us not to share personal information about you that isn't publicly available.
This is commonly known as "opting-out" of information sharing.
By making this selection, you will also limit our affiliates (and MBNA) from using this information to market their products and services to you.
There are several ways to "opt-out":
You can write to us at:
SunTrust Privacy Preferences
P.O. Box 4418
Mail Code 5027
Atlanta, GA 30302
Please include your name, address, telephone number and Social Security number with your request (or fill out the attached "
Customer Privacy Preferences Form").
Incomplete information will delay, or possibly prevent, our ability to honor your request.
You can fax your request with your name, address, telephone number and Social Security number to 678.284.7085, Attn: Customer Privacy Coordinator.
You can visit your nearest branch and speak with a customer service representative.
You can call anytime toll-free to our automated Customer Privacy Request line at 800.432.9472.
Or you can go to the privacy section of our Web site (suntrust.com) and "opt-out" via our secure online form.By selecting "No Share" status, you restrict the use of your personal information in any marketing activities conducted by our affiliates.
This exclusion does not apply, however, to any affiliates with which you currently do business or if you ask to receive information or offers from them.
==========
If you are interested in restricting all marketing you receive from SunTrust, please request "No Direct Mail" and/or "No Telemarketing."
By making these choices, you are directing SunTrust to remove you from lists used for direct mail and telephone solicitations.
These offers are from SunTrust (with the exception of those from MBNA) and usually include enhanced services and special offers.
Once you make either selection ("No Direct Mail" and/or "No Telemarketing"), your name will be removed from these lists and you will no longer receive SunTrust solicitations in this manner.
Each owner of a joint account must elect to restrict the sharing of his or her information (and its use in any marketing) separately.
If it is more convenient, both parties may notify us in the same written or fax communication, or they may individually call the toll-free number or complete the online form.
An "opt-out" request is processed within 30 days of receipt.
==========
Even if you elect not to have information shared or used for marketing, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other laws allow us to share specific details, for example, about your transactions and experience with us.
The use of this information is limited by federal law to specific permissible purposes, such as applications for credit, insurance or employment.
If you have previously opted out.
==========
If you have already submitted a request to "opt-out" of information sharing, there is no need to "opt-out" again.
Customers who "opt-out" have their records marked accordingly in our electronic systems.
This designation is permanent and can only be removed with a written customer request.
This also applies if you've previously requested "No Direct Mail" and/or "No Telemarketing" status.
If you have opted-out in the past and now wish to "opt-in" - or remove the opt-out flag from your records, please write us.
==========
Your privacy in the online world is as important to us as it is everywhere else within SunTrust.
While this policy governs SunTrust's corporate data sharing activities, there may be cases where we need to treat your information differently than described here while doing business with you online.
In these cases, we will provide you with a clear, plain-language disclosure and obtain your authorization before proceeding.
The authorization may come in the form of "clicking" on a disclosure, replying to an e-mail or enrolling in specialized online services.
==========
SunTrust will always protect your privacy in a manner that is consistent with the principles outlined in this policy.
For more complete details of SunTrust's online information practices, including specific examples and an overview of our security measures, please visit us online at suntrust.com and click on "Privacy" link.
SunTrust will never send emails asking for personal or account information, such as passwords, Social Security Numbers, PINs, credit or Check Card numbers, or other confidential information.
==========
In most instances, we will not send you emails unless you have initiated an email dialogue with us; you have previously requested us to communicate with you in this manner; and/or the email is about your relationship with the Bank.
We will send you marketing emails only if you have given us your express consent to receive this type of information.
To help keep your accounts secure, you should be aware of fraudulent emails and pop-up Web pages that attempt to obtain personal and account information.
Fraudulent emails and Web pages will typically ask for:
Account numbers
Credit and Check Card numbers
Social Security numbers
Online Banking sign-ons and passwords
Mothers’ maiden name
Other confidential information

Fraudulent emails and Web sites often appear to be from legitimate companies and include their images and logos.
==========
The emails and Web sites often have a sense of urgency about them.
They state that if you fail to update, verify or confirm your personal or account information, access to your accounts will be suspended.
These emails are not authorized by SunTrust and are fraudulent.
To help protect yourself against online fraud, never provide personal or financial information to unsolicited email, or pop-up Web site requests.
In addition, you should type Web addresses into browsers instead of clicking on links in emails.
If you provide personal and account information or click on a link in an unsolicited email, money from your accounts could be withdrawn and your identity could be stolen.
To report a fraudulent email or Web site please contact us at 800.227.3782 or send us an email at reportfraud@suntrust.com.

National Do Not Call Registry
The Federal Government's national registry makes it easier for consumers to stop receiving most telemarketing sales calls.
You can register online at www.donotcall.gov if you have an active email address, or call toll-free, 888.382.1222 (TTY 866.290.4236), from the number you wish to register.
Registration is free.
==========
The National Do Not Call Registry does not apply to charities, political organizations and telephone surveyors, as well as existing business relationships.
As a SunTrust customer, if you place your number on the national registry, you may still receive occasional telemarketing calls from us.
If you want to stop these calls as well, please request "No Telemarketing" status directly from SunTrust by completing the Preferences Form and returning it via mail or fax.
==========
The most effective privacy policy is the precautions you take to guard against the disclosure and unauthorized use of your account and personal information:
Never provide personal information (including Social Security numbers or account and credit card information) over the phone unless you have initiated the call and know with whom you are speaking.
Safeguard ATM, credit and debit cards.
Sign them immediately upon receipt and always keep them secure.
Memorize personal identification numbers (PINs) and avoid writing PINs, Social Security numbers or credit card account numbers where they can be easily found.
Store cancelled checks, new checks and account statements in a safe place.
Destroy any preapproved credit offers that you don't intend to respond to.
Report lost or stolen checks, credit and debit cards immediately.
