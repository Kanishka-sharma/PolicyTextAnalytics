In creating or updating a Business Account, you must be an authorized representative of the Business in question, and you must provide complete, accurate and up-to-date information about yourself, the Business you represent, and its products and services (for example, a Business Account affiliated with a credit card company must provide, at a minimum, customer service contact information and detailed information about the credit cards it offers, including all rates, fees, rewards and other major terms associated with those credit card offers; simply saying “N/A,” “See Website for More Details” or “Competitive Rates” is not acceptable).

C.
==========
While Business Accounts are made available to Businesses for customization and upkeep so as to contribute to a vibrant, diverse, and holistic online community, they are also used to provide a transformative service to consumers and other companies by enabling them to, among many other things, learn about, compare, review, express opinions about, and rate Businesses and their respective products and services.
Given this dual purpose, Business Accounts cannot be closed.
Furthermore, if you use or maintain a Business Account in a manner that contradicts the Terms, Evolution Finance reserves the right to edit or delete information as it sees fit, populate the Business Account and respective Business Content displayed on or through the Services with whatever information that Evolution Finance deems necessary, important and/or fitting to display, and revoke the Business’s permission and ability to edit information directly.
Furthermore, even if you forgo control of your Business Account, you should NOT expect your Business Content, listings, information and respective products to be removed from the Services.
It is important to understand that Evolution Finance reserves the right to edit, update and add publically available Content to any Business listing at any time.
If there are any inaccuracies, we will be happy to correct them within 10 business days of receiving your request, which should be submitted here.
