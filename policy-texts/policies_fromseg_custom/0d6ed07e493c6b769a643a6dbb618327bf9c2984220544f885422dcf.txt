PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Our Website typically collects two kinds of information about you: (i) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (ii) information that does not personally identify you that we automatically collect when you visit our Website or that you provide to us.
In a few instances, we may require personally-identifiable information in order to use certain features of our services.

In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that you choose to provide to us on our Website, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect certain non-personal information whenever you visit or interact with our Website.
We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand user needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities and to improve our products and services.
We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others.
If data collection is not required for the functionality of our site, we do not collect it.
At any time, you may request your information to be exported and sent to you for review, and we promptly honor any requests by you to have your information deleted and forgotten.

Our Website may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Website and may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on our Websites.
Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Website and other websites you have visited.
Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.
Our Website’s third-party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies and other technologies on your computer and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your computer via an IP address or other device identifier.
These third-party cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things: (i) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (ii) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (iii) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.
Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third-party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
Third-party cookies, web beacons and other third-party technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.
