==========
All sales are final.
Since tickets are a one-of-a-kind item and not replaceable, there are no refunds, exchanges or cancellations.
If an event is postponed, tickets will be honored for the rescheduled date.
New tickets will not need to be issued.
==========
If an event is cancelled without a rescheduled date, User will need to contact the Fulfilling Broker for a refund.
The Fulfilling Broker may require the User to return the supplied tickets at User's expense before receiving any refund User may be entitled to due to cancellation.
EventTicketsCenter.com is not responsible for providing or securing this refund for User.
Any shipping and handling charges are not refundable.
Neither EventTicketsCenter.com nor the Fulfilling Broker will issue exchanges or refunds after a purchase has been made or for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets.
When User receives tickets, User should keep them in a safe place.

==========
Occasionally tickets ordered may no longer be available at the price or in the quantity originally ordered at the time the order is received.
If equivalent or better seat locations are available at the same price, and User has chosen to be automatically upgraded, the Fulfilling Broker will fill the order with the alternative seat locations.
If User is automatically upgraded, User's credit card will be charged at the time the order is received and User will be contacted for notification of the new seat locations.
If User has not chosen to be automatically upgraded, a representative from the Fulfilling Broker may contact User to discuss alternative seat locations, and User's credit card will not be charged until we have received permission from User to fill your order with alternative seat locations.

==========
For certain events, tickets may not be available for immediate shipment.
In this case, a representative from the Fulfilling Broker will contact User with notification of an approximate shipping date.
Tickets will be shipped when available, and choice of an expedited delivery method does not guarantee that tickets will be shipped immediately.
All shipments will require a signature at the point of delivery.
==========
Customers outside of the United States must choose an International Delivery option.
If any other option is chosen for an order outside the United States, the shipping cost may be adjusted by the Fulfilling Broker after the order is placed to use the International Rate.
If User specifies a shipping address that does not allow for Delivery Verification, such as a Post Office Box, User may be required to pay an additional fee to cover the additional risks associated with this type of order.
If such a shipping address is used, the Fulfilling Broker will, at their discretion, either contact you about the additional fee prior to shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
