We deem all such information to be pseudonymous, by which we affirm that the data we collect from you is not sufficient to identify you personally without reference to additional information which we do not have reasonable access to.
We do not intentionally collect any data that is not personally identifiable information.
Our partners and clients may have the capability to share with us information which is not personally identifiable in its nature.
Doing so is in contravention to data processing agreements we have in place with our clients and partners.
All the above data may be recorded and processed on our platform for the purposes of performance, relevant advertising, monitoring our technology, compliance with any legal requirements, debugging and protection against fraud or cyber-attack.
We undertake this processing as a data controller on the basis of your consent for us to provide you with internet facing services and the standard management this entails.

Specific Data Collection & Usage
Silverbullet business pillars
Silverbullet is split into three core pillars: Empower, Build and Activate.
Within the “activation” arm of the businesses, data is collected, processed and shared.
Please see our specific policies regarding the activities within this business pillar.
==========
A. Data collection & processing
We collect personal data from you directly in two cases.
Firstly, when we service an advert to you, we collect personal data from you and are data controller for that data.
In such cases, we collect a tracking identifier from your device which enables us to report our service performance to our customer.
This processing is undertaken based on your consent for Silverbullet to provide reasonable metrics on service delivery for our customers.
Our assessment is that this does not constitute a privacy risk to you.
==========
Secondly, we may collect data from you when you visit our customer’s website and the customer chooses to share your data with us.
Under this circumstance, we are acting solely on behalf of our customer and our customer remains the data controller.
Beyond the personal data we collect directly from you as described above, our partners and customers share your personal data with us, which we process as a data controller.
Where such data is shared with us, we undertake to assure through contractual means that the data has been collected from you legally and transparently, and that our processing of personal data is compatible with the original purposes for which the data was collected.
In doing so, we may rely upon appropriate measures such as pseudonymisation to process the data you have consented to for use of improved advertising performance for our customers, and improved relevance of adverts for you.
==========
We consider that tailoring digital adverts toward your preferences represents a minor privacy impact on you where the product or service advertised is not sensitive in nature.
Considering this, we undertake that we will not consider your personal data when delivering digital advertising for sensitive products or services.
==========
You may nonetheless still receive such adverts from our platform based on alternative, non-personal criteria.
Considering the personal information described above, and other non-personal sources of data, the SBDS Group platforms are designed to make automated decisions about the relevance of digital advertising to you based on inferences we make about your interests.
Given our policy relating to sensitive products or services, we do not believe that the result of this automated decision making produces any legal impact upon you.
==========
We may receive and process your location data from our customers and partners.
When such data is received in the context of an advertising opportunity, we may make a location-based decision on the most relevant advert, for example to promote a local restaurant or retail outlet.
We do not use this data to profile you or your interests.
As a safeguard against processing data you are unhappy with, we are an approved member of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA).
==========
