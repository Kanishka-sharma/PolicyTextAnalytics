P3P in a nutshell
The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) will result in the specification and
demonstration of an interoperable way of expressing privacy practices and preferences by
Web sites and users respectively.
Sites' practices that fall within the range of a user's
preference will be accessed "seamlessly," otherwise users will be notified of a
site's practices and have the opportunity to agree to those terms or other terms and
continue browsing if they wish.
P3P can be incorporated into browsers, or "proxy" products that sit between
your client and the server.
Why is it useful?
==========
Users are informed about and given the opportunity to decide how their data is used.
When users wish to provide information, that information can be more useful to Web
operators than information available today.
It can be easily sent (consequently increasing
the convenience and quality of the information) in a secure manner.
==========
Where does P3P fit in to the Web architecture?
P3P allows one to make statements about privacy practices and preferences in a flexible
manner.
Part of a privacy policy can be the requirement of a digital signature on such
statements.
==========
This will tightly couple to the W3C DSig project.
Given a match between a user's preferences and a site's practices, data may be
exchanged in a convenient and secure manner.
(This is where proposals like OPS fit in.)
