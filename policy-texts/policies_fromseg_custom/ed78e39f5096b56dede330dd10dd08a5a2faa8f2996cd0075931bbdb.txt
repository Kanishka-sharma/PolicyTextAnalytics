	Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the 
	financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen

	amounts due on your billing account upon demand.

	subscription, you are NOT eligible for a prorated refund of any portion

	paid a lump sum for 6 months of service), you are NOT eligible for a 
	prorated refund of any portion of the pre-paid amount upon cancelation.
==========
(h) Reaffirmation of Authorization.
Your non-termination or continued 
	use of the Service reaffirms that ZOOSK is authorized to charge 
	your Payment Method.
ZOOSK may submit those charges for payment and 
	you will be responsible for such charges.
This does not waive ZOOSK's 
	right to seek payment directly from you.
Your charges may be payable in 
	advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you 
	initially subscribed to the Service.
