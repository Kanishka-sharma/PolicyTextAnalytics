Introduction to the Xandr Platform
Xandr provides a digital advertising technology Platform .
Websites, mobile apps and publishers of other internet-connected digital media properties such as internet-connected TVs (each a “Digital Property” and collectively“Digital Properties”) use the Platform to sell ad space on those properties.
Advertisers or companies on the advertiser’s behalf, use the Platform to purchase that ad space in the most efficient way possible.
The Platform also allows Digital Properties and advertisers to do other things, like measure the effectiveness of their ads, to help prevent malware or other bad activity, and similar functions designed to make the buying and selling of ad space seamless, efficient, and effective.
==========
Information Xandr Collects
When you (an internet user) visit a Digital Property that has integrated our Platform or that uses technology that integrates with our Platform, we collect certain information about your visit.
This policy refers this information as “Platform Data”, and includes the following:
Information about your browser including: the type of browser you use, browser language, browser settings, and cookie information.
Information about your device including device operating system version, connection type, device make, device model, device Identifiers such as your IDFA or AAID, and the IP address from which the device accesses a client’s Digital Property.
Precise geographic location information when location services have been enabled for an app on your device that has integrated our technology or that sends that information to our Platform.
==========
Information about your activity on a Digital Property including web pages or apps visited or used and the time those web pages or apps were visited or used.
Information about ads served, viewed or clicked on, including the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it and whether you visited the advertiser’s website or downloaded the advertiser’s app.
Information about your internet service including information about which internet service provider is used by you.
==========
The information we collect does not reflect your name, email address, or other information that directly identifies you, and we take care to ensure that we do not collect any information that tells us who you are.
Xandr’s Platform allows Digital Properties, advertisers, and others to buy and sell data to help make the ads that you see more relevant.
Advertisers may share with us information about your interests or demographic information (your age or gender) that they have collected directly from you and from third parties, and they may use that information on our Platform to help make the ads served to you more relevant or for other purposes.
How Xandr Collects Platform Data
When you first visit a Digital Property, we assign a random unique identifier (an “AppNexus ID”, or “Xandr ID”) to your browser or device, which allows the Platform to automatically recognize your browser or device the next time it visits another Digital Property that has integrated our technology.
This allows our clients and partners to sync their own unique identifiers against this ID so that they can use their own data on the Platform that they may have associated with you (collectively “Digital Identifiers”).
The Platform uses cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile SDKs, and similar technologies to collect this information.
For a detailed description of cookies and similar technologies set by the Platform, see the Xandr Digital Platform Cookie Policy.
==========
How We Use the Information We Collect
We use, and allow our clients to use, the information we collect for the following purposes, some of which are “business purposes” under California law:
For our legitimate business interests to provide services to advertisers and owners of Digital Properties, including providing and operating our services which includes:
Compiling statistics about the advertising transactions occurring through our Platform and conducting research and development for our own internal business purposes, such as analyzing campaign forecasts and conducting machine learning to help our clients improve their sales of ad space and delivery of ads to you
Analyzing and reporting on campaign and ad performance, such as reporting to advertisers about when and how you have been exposed to ads or clicked on ads, and reporting to Digital Properties information about when and how ads were shown on their Digital Properties and whether they were clicked on
Investigating, protecting against and deterring malicious activity, fake traffic or fraudulent, unauthorized or illegal activity on the Platform and on the internet
Hands on help: The Platform enables Xandr’s clients to collect, buy, and sell data and to use Platform Data to buy and sell online advertising.
Sometimes, Xandr staff gives hands-on help to clients use the Platform for these purposes, for example by configuring advertising campaigns for clients to best meet their objectives.
Allowing our clients to use Platform Data for the following advertising-related purposes:
Interest-Based Advertising: Using Platform Data to infer what you may be interested in and to serve ads to you based on these inferred interests.
Our clients may use their Platform Data to create interest profiles about you.

While we take care to obtain assurances from our clients and partners that their use of Platform Data will comply with applicable laws, when clients remove data from the Platform, their use of that data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
How and Why We Share the Information We Collect
We share the information we collect with third parties as follows:
Clients and Third-Party Providers: When you visit a Digital Property and that Digital Property wants to show you ads, and, in order to show you those ads, the Digital Property may allow certain third parties to access your device or receive and use the information noted above under “What Information do we collect and use.”

We share information with advertisers and third-party providers in accordance with the Digital Property’s instructions so that they can decide whether to bid on ad inventory or serve an advertisement and choose the best ad for you using their data and our and our partners’ technology.
This shared information may also be used to create demographic and interest profiles to help our clients choose the best ad for you
These advertisers and third-party providers may use the information we provide to improve their products and services for use by us and others across the broader online advertising ecosystem (e.g. your Device Identifier may be used to improve fraud detection services).
Service Providers (including data centers, hosting providers, anti-fraud, technology and security providers): We share with Service Providers (or enable their collection of) Platform Data so that they can perform functions and provide services to us including for purposes of protecting the safety and security of the online ecosystem, including to detect and prevent malicious activity or fake traffic.

==========
Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising
Web Browsers
You can visit privacycenter.xandr.com to opt out of having the Platform used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behavior.
When you opt out, an opt out cookie (from adnxs.com) will be stored in your web browser.
The Platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt out cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies using the Platform.
If you block or delete the opt out cookie, you will not be opted out and will need to allow cookies from Xandr and renew your opt out choice.
To review your opt in status or learn more about interest-based advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page, the DAA’s WebChoice tool or the DAAC’s WebChoices tool.
==========
Important things to note about the web browser opt out:
Blocked cookies: The opt out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
Deleting or protecting opt outs: If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again.
There are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt out cookies.
For more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/PMC.
==========
Only this browser: The opt out only applies to the browser profile in which you set it.
For example, if you set the opt out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt out will not be active in Chrome.
To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt out process.
This is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.
The opt out does not block or delete cookies: It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior.
==========
If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising.
Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown.
If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.
==========
Mobile Apps
Mobile device system software such as Apple iOS or Google Play Services provide mechanisms that allow users to opt out of the use of information about their usage of mobile apps to deliver targeted ads to their mobile device.
For more information, or to opt out using these mechanisms, consult your device settings (“Opt out of Personalized Ads” on Android devices and “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS devices).
Location Data
Most mobile devices offer you the ability to stop the collection of location information at any time by changing the preferences on your device.
You may also be able to stop the collection of location information by particular apps by adjusting the settings for individual apps or following the standard uninstall process to remove specific mobile apps from your device.
Note when location services have not been enabled in any of your apps, we will still infer data about your location based on your IP address.
==========
