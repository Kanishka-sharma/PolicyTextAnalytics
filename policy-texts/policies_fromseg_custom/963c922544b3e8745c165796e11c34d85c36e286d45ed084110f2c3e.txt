The purpose of profiling cookies that we may use is the following: the cookie that we install is used to track the web surfing of the user, in order to define the so-called “profile of interest” of the user, based on the searches
made and the pages visited.
These information pages are associated to a unique identifier and are ranked with our proprietary technology; in this way they help us define the profile of such identifier.
INFORMATION SHARING
These data are subsequently processed by a statistical engine and are used to send marketing and promotional information, and in general to send you specific materials of interest for you.
The cookie we use is: visitor_id, that we use to keep track and store information like technical characteristics of the device used, time of browsing, URL browsed, actions like clicking on banners or other parts of the URL.
We then process these data with statistical techniques.
When possible, technical data may be enriched with demographic information collected from third-party companies such as Mobile Network Operators.
