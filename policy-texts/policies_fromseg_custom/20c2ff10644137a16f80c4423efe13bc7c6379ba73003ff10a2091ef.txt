Information related to Privacy Shield
For details about the Privacy Shield program: https://www.privacyshield.gov/
Qualtrics complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
Qualtrics has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
The key goals of Privacy Shield are to inform both EU and Swiss individuals about:
the right of individuals to access their personal data
the choices and means an organization offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal data
the requirement for an organization to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements
Qualtrics’ Privacy Shield self-certification does not cover human resources data.
Privacy Shield may provide individuals the right to (i) access the data that we hold about them, (ii) request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield, or (iii) limit the use and disclosure of their personal information.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Qualtrics commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of personal information.
EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Qualtrics at: privacy@qualtrics.com.
Qualtrics has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the American Arbitration Association (AAA), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.
If an individual does not receive timely acknowledgment of its complaint from us, or if we have not addressed an individual’s complaint satisfactorily, such individual should contact the AAA for more information or to file a complaint (contact details below).
The services of the AAA are provided at no cost.
==========
Customer Data is stored in a specific geographical region chosen by the Customer.
Where it is necessary to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States, it is solely for the purpose of processing as per instructions from the controller or to comply with applicable laws.
Qualtrics implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access.
==========
Because adequate protection is provided by Privacy Shield participants, contracts with Privacy Shield participants for mere processing do not require prior authorization (or such authorization will be granted automatically by the EU Member States), as would be required for contracts with recipients not participating in the Privacy Shield or otherwise not providing adequate protection.
Qualtrics self-certifies with Privacy Shield.
A self-assessment is signed by a company officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non-compliance.
Qualtrics is required to respond promptly to EU or Swiss individual inquiries, and other requests for information from the Department of Commerce relating to its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles.
Under Privacy Shield, an individual has the right, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms.
Under Privacy Shield, Qualtrics must respond to individual complaints within 45 days.
