This document discloses our information gathering and usage practices.

Use of your information

Email
It is the policy of Trade Me to send our members email throughout the auction process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc.).
Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request.
In addition, Trade Me will send a monthly newsletter to members.
Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list.
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.
==========
Emailing Tools
Trade Me provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to Trade Me or to send references to a specific listing to a friend.
You may not use the "Email This Auction to a Friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions.
We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses.
==========
Membership Registration

Nielsen//NetRatings - NZ internet statistics
Trade Me, like most large New Zealand websites, uses the Nielsen//NetRatings counting system to collect information such as the number of visitors per day or the number of pages requested per day.
To do this, Trade Me has a small piece of code on each page which counts these statistics.
This enables us to see where we are in the 'top 10' list of New Zealand websites.
For more information, View the Nielsen//NetRatings privacy policy.
