We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs.
Our Privacy Statement provides details of our approach to privacy and how your personal information is collected and used.
==========
We protect your information.
We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.
When we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt it as it is transmitted to us.
Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only.
Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.

We tell you how we intend to use your information.
When we ask you for information, we tell you, or it will be clear, what we need to fulfill your request and how we will use it
We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.
We do not share your personal information with third parties for their promotional use.
We have limited relationships with third parties.
==========
Sometimes, we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service).
The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law.
For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.
