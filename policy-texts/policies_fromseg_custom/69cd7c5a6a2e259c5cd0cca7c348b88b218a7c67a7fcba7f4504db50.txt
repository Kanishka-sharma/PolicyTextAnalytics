We may charge a nonrefundable activation fee, deposit, prepayment or other fee to establish or maintain Services.
==========
Term Commitments.
Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, our service plans require that you maintain service for a minimum term ("Term Service Plan"), usually 1 or 2 years.
After satisfying this minimum term, your service plan will continue on a month-to-month basis unless you have agreed to extend the term for additional period(s).
Certain service, promotional or product offers may require that you agree to or extend a Term Service Plan.

==========
You are responsible for evaluating such content.
You are also responsible for any use of our Services through any wireless device on your account including, but not limited to, use by children or minors.
We strongly recommend that you closely monitor any such usage.
==========
Changing Services.
Changes to Services will generally be effective at the start of your next full invoicing cycle.
==========
In certain instances, the changes may take place sooner, in which case your invoice will reflect pro-rated charges.
Certain changes may be conditioned upon payment of an Early Termination Fee or certain other charges.
Termination of Services.
==========
Consistent with this Agreement: (a) we may terminate Services at any time with notice to you and, in certain instances, without notice; and (b) you may terminate Services at any time with prior notice to us.

==========
Wireless Devices, Numbers & E-mail Addresses.
We did not manufacture your wireless device and we are not responsible for any defects or for the acts or omissions of the manufacturer.
The only warranties on your device are any limited warranties extended by the manufacturer directly to you or passed on to you through us.
Your device may not accept Services directly from any other carrier.
==========
You do not have any rights to any number, e-mail address or other identifier we may assign to your device or account; you may not modify, change or transfer any of these except as we allow or as allowed for by law.
In certain instances, you may transfer your number from another carrier to us, or from us to another carrier.

If you transfer your number away from us, the terms of this Agreement (e.g., Early Termination Fee, etc.) still apply.
If a transfer to Sprint is not successful, you will be responsible for any discounts provided to you with the purchase of your device.
See our printed in-store materials or visit www.sprintpcs.com for additional important information on number transfers.
==========
Coverage.
Available coverage areas for Services are generally identified in our mapping brochures and at www.sprintpcs.com.
This may include coverage on our digital network (the "Sprint Nationwide PCS Network") as well as coverage we make available to you through agreements with other carriers ("off network" or "roaming" coverage).
All coverage maps are high level representations of outdoor coverage and there are gaps in coverage within areas shown as covered on the maps.
Coverage is not available everywhere, nor can we guarantee you will receive coverage at all times, or without interruptions or delays (e.g., dropped calls, blocked calls, etc.) in the coverage areas we identify.
Actual coverage and quality of Services may be affected by conditions within or beyond our control, including network problems, software, signal strength, your equipment, structures (including buildings in which you may be located), atmospheric, geographic, or topographic conditions.
==========
Roaming Coverage.
You are roaming anytime your phone indicates that you are roaming.
Roaming coverage is only available with certain devices and, unless included as part of your Services, will result in additional charges.
Roaming calls placed "manually" (through an operator or with a credit card) will always incur separate and additional charges.
Depending on your phone settings, you may automatically roam if there is a gap or interruption in coverage within the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network coverage area and roaming coverage areas.
See your phone guide for how to adjust phone settings.
Certain features and services may not be available in roaming coverage areas (including PCS Vision, voicemail, call waiting, call forwarding, etc.).
Charges.
==========
Carefully review the terms of your Services.
You will be assessed charges based on the terms of your Services including, without limitation, monthly recurring charges and charges based on actual usage (e.g., charges for long distance, roaming, call forwarding, directory assistance, etc.).
==========
Airtime and other time based usage charges are calculated from when your device first initiates contact with a network until the network connection is broken, whether or not you were actually successful in connecting to the intended destination.
However, you will not be charged for voice calls that ring and do not pick up, or if you get a busy signal.
For voice calls received by your device, you are charged from the time shortly before the phone starts ringing until the call is terminated.
You are charged for an entire voice call based on the time period in which the call is initiated.
==========
Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next minute.
Sprint PCS Vision Charges.
==========
Vision usage is measured in bytes, not in minutes.
Bytes are rounded up to kilobytes.
==========
Usage rounding occurs at the top of each clock hour while in a session and at the end of each session and is then charged to you based on the terms of your Services.
Depending on your Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per kilobyte.
Usage charges may be rounded up to the next cent at monthly or other intervals.
In certain instances, you may not know that your session has not ended.
==========
As long as your device is connected to our network, you will incur data usage charges.
You will be charged for all data directed to the internet address (or "IP address") assigned to your device, regardless of who initiates the activity or whether your device actually receives the data.
==========
This includes, but is not limited to, the amount of data associated with the particular information/item (e.g. game, ringer, email, etc.), additional data used in accessing, transporting and routing this information/item on our network, data from partial or interrupted downloads, re-sent data, and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications.
Based on these and a number of other factors (e.g., the specific application, network performance, etc.) data used and charged to you will vary widely, even for the same activity.
Estimates of data usage - for example, the size of downloadable files - will not be accurate or a reliable predictor of actual usage.
Your invoice will not separately identify the number of kilobytes attributable to your use of specific sites, sessions or services.
==========
Taxes and Surcharges.
We invoice you for taxes, fees and other charges levied by or remitted directly to federal, state, local or foreign governments including, without limitation, sales, gross receipts, Universal Service, use, and excise taxes.
==========
If you claim any tax exemption, you must provide us with a valid tax-exempt document.
Tax exemptions are not applied retroactively.
==========
We also invoice you for surcharges that we collect and keep to pay for the costs of complying with government programs such as number pooling and portability, and Enhanced 911 service; these charges are not the taxes nor government imposed assessments.
Invoicing & Payment.
Invoicing cycles and dates may change from time to time.
Monthly recurring and related charges for Services are generally invoiced one invoicing cycle in advance.
Other charges are invoiced soon after they are incurred.
Most usage is generally applied to the invoicing cycle in which they are incurred, but in some instances may be applied to subsequent invoicing cycles.
==========
You are responsible for all charges associated with any device activated on your account, regardless of who used the device.
You must pay all charges by the due date on the invoice.
Past due amounts accrue late charges until paid at the rate of 5% per month or at the highest rate allowed by law and may result in immediate suspension of your account.
==========
If you agree to any auto-payment option through banking or credit account, we may initiate payment from the account for all amounts we invoice you without additional authorization or notice.
Based on your credit or payment history, we may require certain forms of guaranteed payment as a condition of maintaining Services.
If we invoice you for amounts on behalf of a third-party, payments received are first applied to amounts due to us.
You may be charged additional fees for certain methods of payment and for payments denied by a financial institution.
Acceptance of payments (even if marked "paid in full") does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe us.
==========
Disputed Charges.
Disputes concerning any charges invoiced must be raised within 60 days of the date of the invoice.
You accept all charges not disputed in this time period.
Disputes can only be made by calling or writing us as directed on your invoice.
==========
Account Spending Limit & Deposits.
We may impose an account spending limit ("ASL") on any account without notice.
We will notify you of an ASL based on your credit or payment history and may reduce the ASL at any time with prior notice.
An ASL should not be relied on to manage usage on your account.
==========
We may suspend an account without prior notice when the account balance reaches the ASL, even if the account is not past due.
Services can be restored upon payment of an amount that brings the account balance below the ASL and any past due amounts.
If we require a deposit for you to establish or maintain an account, we will hold the deposit as partial guarantee of payment for Services.
==========
We may change the deposit amount at any time with notice for good reason.
Except as we allow, a deposit may not be used to pay any invoice or delay payment.
The deposit amount, the length of time we hold the deposit and changes to the deposit amount are determined based on your credit and payment history.
==========
The rate of interest, if any, on the deposit is subject to change.
We may mix deposits with our other funds.
==========
If your account is terminated for any reason, we may without notice apply your deposit to any outstanding charges.
We may send any remaining deposit amounts to your last known address within 75 days after account termination.
If the funds are returned to us, you may claim these funds for one year from the date of return.

Any money held during this one-year period will not accrue interest for your benefit and are subject to a servicing fee charged against the balance.
You forfeit any portion of the money left after the one-year period.

NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES, PHONES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

THIS SECTION SURVIVES TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES.
INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT,  YOU AND SPRINT AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SERVICES, ANY PHONES/EQUIPMENT, OR ADVERTISING, EVEN IF IT ARISES AFTER YOUR SERVICES HAVE TERMINATED, AND INCLUDING CLAIMS YOU MAY BRING AGAINST SPRINT'S EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR THAT SPRINT MAY BRING AGAINST YOU ("CLAIMS").
==========
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS PROVISIONS, NOT STATE LAW, GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS OF WHETHER A CLAIM IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION.
THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PREVENT EITHER YOU OR SPRINT FROM BRINGING APPROPRIATE CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, BEFORE THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION OR A STATE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.
YOU AND SPRINT FURTHER AGREE THAT NEITHER SPRINT NOR YOU WILL JOIN ANY CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY IN A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING; THAT NO CLAIM EITHER SPRINT OR YOU HAS AGAINST THE OTHER SHALL BE RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS; AND THAT NEITHER SPRINT NOR YOU WILL ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE.
==========
IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO A CLAIM, WE AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY.
A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law will conduct the arbitration.
The arbitration will be filed with and the arbitrator will be selected according to the rules of either JAMS or the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF"), or, alternatively, as we may mutually agree.
We agree to act in good faith in selecting an arbitrator.
The arbitration will be conducted by and under the then-applicable rules of JAMS or NAF, wherever the arbitration is filed or, if the arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement of the parties, the then-applicable rules of JAMS will apply unless the parties agree otherwise.
==========
All expedited procedures prescribed by the applicable rules will apply.
We agree to pay our respective arbitration costs, except as otherwise required by rules of JAMS or NAF, as applicable, but the arbitrator can apportion these costs as appropriate.
==========
The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
If any party files a judicial or administrative action asserting a claim that is subject to arbitration and another party successfully stays such action or compels arbitration, the party filing that action must pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including attorneys' fees.
If any portion of this Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes section is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Section remains in full force and effect.
Miscellaneous.
==========
You may notify us by calling us at 1-888-211-4PCS, or use that number to get our current address for written notice.

==========
This Agreement is governed by and must be construed under federal law and the laws of the State of Kansas, without regard to choice of law principles.
If either of us waives or fails to enforce any requirement under this Agreement in any one instance, that does not waive our right to later enforce that requirement.
If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect.
==========
Section headings are for descriptive, non-interpretive purposes only.
You may not assign this Agreement to any other person or entity without our prior written approval.
