==========
Upon registration to the Website (or its mobile version), the Client will be asked to choose a username and password to be used by the Client on each future login and for the performance of transactions and use of the Company's Services.
In order to protect the Client's privacy and operation with the Website sharing registration details (including without limitation, username and password) by the Client with other persons or business entities is strictly prohibited.
The Company shall not be held responsible for any damage or loss caused to the Client due to improper use (including prohibited and unprotected use) or storage of such username and password, including any such use made by a third party, and whether or not known to or authorized by the Client.
Any use of the Website with the Client's username and password is Client's sole responsibility.
The Company shall not be held responsible for any such use, including for validation that Client is actually operating in his/her account.
The Client is obliged to forthwith notify the Company's client service of any suspicion for unauthorized use of the Client’s account.
You may contact us at any time through the points of contact listed in the Section OUR CONTACT DETAILS below.
==========
Encryption of your data in transit.
Encryption provides a high level of security and privacy for your data.
When you enter your data in our platform we use strong encryption technologies (such as Transport Layer Security) to protect your data during transmission from your devices to our servers.
For providing more trust and security we use digital EV (Extended Validation) Certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities.
==========
You can see the ‘Green Bar’ in the supported browser versions which confirms what all transmitted data is secure.
Protection of your data in our infrastructure.
==========
We make it a priority to develop services that are secure "by default".
The "default" security of our services means that all new services and features are designed with strict security requirements in mind before we even begin development.
==========
This is the key to guaranteed protection and privacy of all data that our services handle and store, once the service or new feature is released.
To secure your data, we use the pseudonymisation which allows most of our services to operate without using your actual data.
Instead of that, our services use a system ID that can't be traced back to identify you.
==========
The Company is always vigilant about the security of your data stored in our infrastructure.
Because of that we locate all our equipment which is used for your data processing in secure data centres.
==========
Network access to this equipment is isolated from the Internet.
We use network segmentation for isolation of services which need different levels of security from each other.
==========
In addition, we restrict logical access to your data for our employees on a "need to know" basis.
So, only the personnel that really requires access to your data for the purpose of providing you with our best service, will have access to it.
==========
Threats protection.
Our Company is highly knowledgeable about modern threats to data security and privacy, and we are well prepared to combat them.
All events that occur in our infrastructure are continuously monitored, analysed and responded, which allows us to ensure proper protection of your data, keeping it safe from threats, vulnerabilities, and the effects of malware.
==========
In the event of a failure that affects the accessibility of your data, we have data backup and recovery procedures in place that will help us restore your data in a short time.
