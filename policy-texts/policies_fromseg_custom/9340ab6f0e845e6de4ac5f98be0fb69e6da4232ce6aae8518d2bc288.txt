The term “Thirty Mile Zone” originated in the 1960s, when due to the  growth of location shoots, studios established a “thirty mile zone” to  monitor rules for filming in Hollywood.
The center of the zone was the  offices of The Association of Motion Pictures and Television Producers,  formerly at Beverly and La Cienega Boulevards in Los Angeles.
==========
TMZ  reinvented the thirty mile zone and now serves as the Internet’s  premiere address for entertainment news.
Launched in 2005, TMZ’s  meteoric rise followed its exclusive on two of the biggest stories in  entertainment: Mel Gibson's DUI arrest and subsequent encounter with law  enforcement, and Michael Richards' ill-fated trip to the Laugh Factory.

TMZ also broke the news of the breakup of Britney Spears and Kevin  Federline's marriage.
TMZ altered the entertainment news  landscape by changing the way the public gets its news.
