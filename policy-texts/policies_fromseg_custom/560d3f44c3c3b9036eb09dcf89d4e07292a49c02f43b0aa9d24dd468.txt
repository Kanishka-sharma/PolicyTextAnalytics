If you are interested in further conversation, please contact us at privacy@atp.ioLast updated February 1st, 2018DataWhile atp collects certain categories of personal data in the course of measuring ad effectiveness via the platform, we do not intentionally collect data that reveals your real-world identity, such as your name, address, phone number, or any government identifiers.
Instead, atp collects certain data about your computer or device through the use of cookies and other similar technologies.
We may assign a unique identifier called a atp ID to your browser, mobile device or any supported internet enabled device when we serve an ad to it or you use it to access a client’s digital properties.
==========
This includes their websites, emails and apps where their ads appear.
We do this to measure with reasonable confidence that a computer or device is the same one with which we had previously interacted.
Well, how does that work?
==========
This atp ID may be a cookie ID (small text files that can be stored on your browser), a mobile advertising ID a unique ID assigned by the mobile operating system, e.g. Apple ID for Advertising or Android Advertising ID) or a statistical ID (an ID generated by atp which is an amalgamation of information from your computer such as operating system, user agent string and fonts which in concert creates a probabilistic distinct user profile).
In some cases, a client may provide us hashed personal data which we may use to recognise multiple atp IDs are in fact interactions by the same individual.
This helps the atp product and people analyze behavior data and improve consumer experiences.
Who doesn’t like personalized attention?Your atp ID is associated with other categories of personal data that we collect about you.
These categories include the following:Pixel Data: atp clients may use the platform to collect data regarding your interactions with them when you visit their digital properties such as their website and apps.

A segment is a grouping of users who share one or more common attributes and provides further detail to what makes individuals special to our clients.Cookie Syncing: atp receives personal data from third-party sources that allows us to associate their identifiers with our atp ID in a process called cookie synching.
