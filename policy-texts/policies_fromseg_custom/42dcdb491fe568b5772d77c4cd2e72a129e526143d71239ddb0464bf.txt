SiteAdvisor Privacy Policy
The really big picture: 

Your privacy is protected with us.
We won't sell, rent, or give away your personal information to outside companies for them to market to you.
(Believe us -- we hate spam, too.)
As you use SiteAdvisor's software, it checks our master database in order to display our safety ratings about the sites you visit.
==========
(Think of this as asking a tour guide in a new city you're visiting about how safe it would be to walk down "5th Street".
You have to name the street to get an answer.)
==========
We do this because our database of safety ratings is far too large and too frequently changing for us to send it to you in advance when you download our software.
We never store information about where specific users go online or about what they do online.
==========
We do keep master anonymous logs of which sites our users visit so we can prioritize those sites for retesting.
But these logs contain no information about which users visited which sites -- no personally identifying information, and not even users' IP addresses.
==========
(Continuing our tour guide analogy, it's as if the tour guide immediately and permanently forgot who asked about 5th Street, but did make a mental note to check the safety of that street at some point in the future).
Information We collect and How we Use It


SiteAdvisor collects personally identifiable information such as name, e-mail, and your organization/company when you register as a user of our products, sign up for one of our newsletters, or register online with us to leave feedback about our products or our Web site ratings.
==========
We don't share this information with any outside parties, except that we may disclose this information to selected outside vendors to help process and fulfill any orders you may place with us.
These companies are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for fulfilling the service you requested on our behalf.
==========
If you optionally choose to register with us and leave feedback about a Web site, we'll show your "nickname" (if you provide one) together with your feedback comments.
You can also leave anonymous feedback by submitting comments while not signed in as a registered user.
==========
To fulfill requests for paid versions of our software, we will collect additional information from you such as mailing address, phone number and credit card information.
We may disclose this information to selected outside vendors to help process and fulfill your orders.
==========
In order for us to help protect you online and provide ratings for the sites you visit while you're using our software, SiteAdvisor automatically receives anonymous information about where you're currently searching, browsing or transacting online.
We use this information only to be able to show you safety ratings and recommendations for the sites you visit and the searches you conduct.
This information is not associated with any personally identifiable information.
If you remove our software, this information will no longer be sent to us, and you will no longer receive safety ratings while you search or browse.
==========
From time to time SiteAdvisor may offer users the opportunity to participate in optional product improvement programs, contests or other promotional programs at the explicit agreement of each user.
We will explain how information is collected and used in each of these optional programs as they are announced.
==========
In addition, we may disclose personally-identifiable and information: (i) to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) SiteAdvisor's rights or property, other members or users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and (ii) to third parties when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
SiteAdvisor may transfer personally identifiable and other information to successors of our business assets, whose policies for handling this information may differ from this Privacy Policy.
==========
Cookies

SiteAdvisor uses cookies to recognize you when you register with us, so that you don't have to keep signing in to leave feedback as a registered user.
It is not necessary to accept cookies to use SiteAdvisor, although if you disable cookies, you'll need to sign in each time you want to leave feedback as a registered user.
SiteAdvisor does not let other companies place cookies on your computer when you access resources on our Website.
==========
Your Ability to Edit Your Information on File with Us and Discontinue Use of our Product


Users who subscribe to our optional newsletters can unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe link which is included in every newsletter.
You can uninstall our software at any time, which will stop your Web browsing activity from being checked against our central database and will in turn disable safety ratings for the sites you visit.
We reserve the right to send you infrequent communications relating to SiteAdvisor's service, such as critical service announcements and administrative messages, as long as you are a subscriber to one of our newsletters, a registered user on our Web site, or a registered user of our software.
==========
Confidentiality and Security 


Access to private and confidential data on our systems is limited to only those employees with a specific need to retrieve this information.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect personal information about you once we receive it on our systems.
Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.
