Read about our repeat infringers policy here at https://info.xvideos.com/legal/repeat.
If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or other content infringes upon your copyright, submit a copyright infringement takedown request available at the following link https://info.xvideos.com/takedown with the form containing the following information:

an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and

Pursuant to the Website’s policies and in accordance with the DMCA, the uploader has five (5) days to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown request was sent in error.
The counter-notification may be sent to WebGroup’s email address from which the user originally received the forwarded takedown request.
For the Website to consider a counter-notification, it must include the following:

A physical or electronic signature of the uploader; and
Identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available; and
A statement under penalty of perjury that the uploader has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
The uploader's name, address, and telephone number; and
A statement that the uploader consents to the jurisdiction of the federal District Court for the judicial district in which the user is located, or if the uploader’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Website may be found; and
A statement that the uploader will accept service of process from the takedown request claimant or an agent of such person.
Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be considered by the Website.
==========
Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your counter-notification related to the relevant takedown request and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, we will process your personal data and will provide the party who originally made the takedown request with your completed counter-notification, which will include the following personal data: your name, and contact information, as well as the content of your counter-notification.
We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the addresses of your takedown request or counter-notifications and without it, we are unable to process your takedown request as prescribed under the DMCA.
Where the takedown request claimant resides outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims.
We undertake to transmit any personal data included in your counter notification exclusively for the purpose of processing your counter-notification and will notify the recipient that any personal data included in your counter-notification is of confidential and sensitive nature.
However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.

Until that time, your uploaded material will remain inaccessible.
We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked.
