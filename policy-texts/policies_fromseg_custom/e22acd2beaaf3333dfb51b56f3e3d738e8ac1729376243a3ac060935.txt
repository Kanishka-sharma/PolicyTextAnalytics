Cookie Statement
Types of cookies and similar technologies
Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of text that are sent as files to your computer or mobile device when you visit most websites.
Cookies may be delivered by us (first-party cookies) or delivered by a third-party partner or supplier (third-party cookies).
Cookies are either session cookies or persistent cookies.
Session cookies enable sites to recognise and link the actions of a user during a browsing session and expire at the end of each session.
Persistent cookies help us recognise you as an existing user and these cookies are stored on your system or device until they expire, although you can delete them before the expiry date.
==========
Other similar technologies

Web beacons, GIFs and clear GIFs are tiny graphics, each with a unique identifier, that are embedded invisibly on sites and in emails.
Web beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited, or if ad banners on our sites and other sites are effective.
We also use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know whether our emails have been opened by recipients, which helps us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications, promotions and marketing campaigns.
Proximity-based beacons send one-way signals over very short distances, to communicate with associated mobile apps installed on your phone.
==========
They can notify you about experiences related to your trip, for example, and can alert you to related deals or promotions.
Beacons only communicate with your device when you are in close proximity, and only if you have given consent within the relevant mobile application.
Pixels are small objects embedded into a web page that are not visible to the user.
We use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, facilitate the log-in process, monitor the activity on our sites and deliver online advertising.
==========
Tags are small pieces of HTML code that tell your browser to request certain content generated by an ad server.
We use tags to show you relevant advertising and promotions.
Scripts are pieces of JavaScript code that launch automatically when certain web pages load, to determine whether or not users view associated advertisements.
Local storage objects, such as HTML 5, are used to store content and preferences.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use local storage objects to collect and store information.
==========
All the technologies described above will be collectively referred to in this Cookie Statement as 'cookies'.

Do Not Track signals and similar mechanisms
Some web browsers may transmit Do Not Track signals to sites with which the browser communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether users are even aware of them.
Participants in the leading organisation for setting Internet standards that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, sites should do when they receive such signals.
==========
We currently do not take action in response to these signals.
If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess our sites’ responses to these signals and make appropriate updates to this Cookie Statement.
Contact us
If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, please contact us via the Privacy section on our Customer service portal here or alternatively, you can email our customer service team at privacyEUR @chat.
