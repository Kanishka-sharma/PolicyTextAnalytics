Other Important Information
This section contains additional information about our privacy practices that you may find helpful.
Advertising
You may see T-Mobile and other advertisements on your devices - whether you are connected to our network or using another connection method (e.g., Wi-Fi or wireline connections).
In some cases, these ads may be targeted to your device based on information the advertiser has gathered about your prior online or offline behavior, or other data about your interests.
These online ads are sometimes called “interest-based” or “targeted” ads.
==========
Like most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T-Mobile works with third-party advertising networks, which collect certain information about our site and app visitors, serve ads on our behalf, and measure their effectiveness.
The advertising networks that provide these ads may place cookies, web beacons, or use similar technologies on their partners’ websites and apps, including T-Mobile’s.
This technology allows them to track device activity over time across online properties.
Their use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies and those of the sites where they operate.
==========
To learn more about ad targeting and how to opt-out of interest-based ads, please see http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
For additional details, please review our article on Online Advertising in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Under California law we must disclose how we respond to Web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, we do not currently respond to the browser DNT signals when you use our services and products or interact with our websites or online services.
Children
We do not knowingly solicit minors (anyone under the age of 18) to purchase our Products or Services.
Generally, if you purchase and then authorize a minor to use our Products or Services by providing them a device or other access associated with your account, any personal data associated with their use will be treated as your personal data under this privacy policy.
Where applicable, if you are the primary account holder, you will have the ability to set the marketing and other preferences for any other lines on your account, including those for any minors to whom you provide a device.
Our Products and Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 nor designed to attract them, and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect personal data from anyone known to be under the age of 13.
We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including Internet browsing and app usage) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.
==========
CPNI
Some of the information we collect may be Customer Proprietary Network Information – or "CPNI.”
CPNI is data generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you, i.e., voice services.
CPNI does not include your name, address, or phone number.
Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted processes and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules.
For additional details, please review our article on CPNI in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Directories and Caller ID
We do not publish directories of our customers’ wireless numbers or make such numbers available to third parties for listing in their public directories without the customer’s prior consent.
We do, however, provide your number and associated name to enable Caller ID and similar services when you make a call.
You can request that we exclude your name from Caller ID by calling customer service.
See “How to Contact Us” below.
You can also block your number from being displayed temporarily for a specific call by entering *67 prior to entering the number you wish to call (including area code).
Note that this does not block your number when you call 911 or dial toll-free numbers such as 1-800 numbers.
Geolocation Data
If your mobile device is turned on, our network is collecting data about the device location.
We may use, provide access to, or disclose this network location data without your approval to provide and support our services, including to route wireless communications, operate and improve our network and business, detect and prevent fraud, provide emergency responders information about how to find you when you call 911, or as required by law or emergency.

Information for Nevada Consumers: Your Nevada Privacy Rights
Nevada Revised Statutes Sections 603A.300-360 requires us to disclose that Nevada consumers may request that website and online service operators like T-Mobile not sell certain information about them – referred to in the law as “covered information.”
T-Mobile does not currently engage in any sales of covered information as defined in the law.
Nevada consumers who nevertheless wish to submit a request that T-Mobile not sell their covered information may do so by clicking here and authenticating through their existing online account or establishing an authenticated account so we can record the request appropriately.
==========
INSIGHTS Program
We have developed a reporting program, INSIGHTS, in connection with a consumer research partner, to provide businesses with aggregate reports on mobile use trends and patterns.
For example, when city traffic planners need to understand traffic patterns, the INSIGHTS Program can use de-identified historical cell tower location data to create aggregate reports that identify the number of commuters on different highways at different times of day.
The consumer research reports created by our partner contain only aggregate data.
You may opt-out of having your de-identified mobile usage data used to help create the aggregate reports as set forth below in INSIGHTS Program Choice.
For more information, see the INSIGHTS article in our Privacy Center.
==========
Internet of Things
In many cases, we provide connectivity to Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices and services offered by other companies.
In such cases, we collect basic information about the information flowing over our network.
However, if you are a customer of a T-Mobile Internet of Things (“IoT”) Service (such as T-Mobile SyncUp Drive or MetroSMART Ride), we, and our application providers, also collect information from the IoT device and any related app to support the Service to which you have subscribed.
The information varies depending on the IoT Service, but may include personal data like contact information and location, audio, and device activity and measurement data.
For example, if you are a customer of the T-Mobile SyncUp Drive or MetroSMART Ride Service, the personal data includes driver behavior information such as information about acceleration, braking, speed, and engine RPMs, as well as vehicle location and Diagnostic Trouble Codes (“DTC”) related to your vehicle.
Location-Based Services
Depending on your device, you may be able to obtain services (such as mapping or ride-sharing service) that use the location of your device.
These services, referred to as Location-Based Services (“LBS”), are generally provided by third parties in connection with apps or websites.
==========
Third-party LBS providers generally use your device operating system’s location capabilities, which can determine location independent of our communications network, to derive device location.
We do not share network location data with third-party LBS providers for their LBS.
It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device and the privacy policies and terms under which third-party LBS are provided.
In some cases, T-Mobile may directly offer you LBS.
Where we do so, we will request your permission before we access precise location data to support the service.
==========
We may, however, use your IP address to estimate your general location without seeking specific consent (such as to infer what news or weather may be most relevant to you when browsing a T-Mobile website).
T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available here.
For additional details, please review our article on Location Services in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Technologies in our Retail Stores
Our partners have deployed beacons in some of our stores and we receive aggregate reports (none of which identify any individual or device) from these partners regarding store traffic that relies in part on information the partner collects from such beacons through mobile applications.
We may also use technology that tracks aggregate traffic patterns and wait times in our stores using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth identifiers (e.g., a MAC address).
Where such technology is used, we will provide a prominent notice at the location.
If you wish to exclude your device from such in-store mobile analytics, you can opt out at any time by entering your MAC address at https://optout.smart-places.org.
We may use video monitoring and recording in our retail stores for security purposes as well as traffic pattern and other analytics purposes.
We do not use facial recognition technology.
==========
Unaffiliated Websites and Mobile Applications
Our Products and Services may provide links or the ability to access third-party websites, or the ability to install or use third-party mobile apps on your device.
Those websites and apps are not controlled by T-Mobile or governed by this privacy policy.
These websites and mobile apps may collect personal data from or about you.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any website or mobile app that we do not control, and your interactions with such websites and mobile apps are governed solely by their respective privacy policies, not this privacy policy.
For additional details, please review our article on Device Apps in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.
==========
Our Products and Services may also offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Products and Services with other media, and vice versa.
Your use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.
For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.
==========
US-Based Organization
T-Mobile is headquartered in the United States and our data processing activities primarily occur in the United States.
You acknowledge that any personal data we collect may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States.
You further acknowledge that the United States has standards for the processing and storage of personal data that may not be equivalent to (and may be less comprehensive than) those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen, and you consent to our collection, transfer, processing, and storage of your personal data in the United States.
