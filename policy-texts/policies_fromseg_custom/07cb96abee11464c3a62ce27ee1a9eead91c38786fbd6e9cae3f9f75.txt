Terms of Service
Welcome  to the PlayStation family of web sites (“Sites” or “our Sites”).
These Terms of Service apply to  us.playstation.com, all official game sites for games published by Sony  Computer Entertainment America Inc., naughtydog.com and any other sites operated  by SCEA or its subsidiaries (“SCEA”) or that link to these Terms of Service.
Don’t forget that you are legally  obligated to the Terms of Service noted below as well as to any other  agreements, terms and rules that we tell you apply to your use of our Sites.
Please don’t use our Sites if you don’t  agree to these Terms of Service because once you are on our Sites, you have to  follow the rules.
SCEA and its  subsidiaries, representatives and agents that assist in operating our Sites  reserve the right to temporarily or permanently disable access to the Sites for  anyone who violates these Terms of Service.
Because of the importance of these Terms of Service, we will disable  access to the Sites at our discretion and may do so without notice.
Because we reserve the right to change  the Terms of Service at any time, we recommend visiting this page periodically  to make sure that the rules have not changed since your last visit.
By using these Sites, you agree to be bound  by all of the current terms of service.
Here  are the Terms of Service we expect you to follow:
1.
ABILITY TO ACCEPT TERMS OF SERVICE 
These Terms of Service form a legally binding contract  between you and us.
By using our Sites,  you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age, an emancipated minor or  possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to  enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, representations and  responsibilities set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide and comply  with these Terms of Service.
2.
==========
ACCOUNT AND NON-ACCOUNT  USERS
You  do not need to create a PlayStation®Network ("PSN") account  with us in order to view the Sites.
However, if you already have a PSN account or if you create one, you  will have access to more of the features on our Sites, as well as access to the  PSN online community – which allows you to play games online and buy content  and services, like new levels for your favorite games, movies, television shows  or original programs.
If you do not already have a PSN account, you can create  one here: http://www.us.playstation.com/PSN/SignUp.  Note that if you do choose to create a PSN  account, you will need to agree to a separate Terms of Service and User  Agreement ("ToSUA") and Privacy Policy that govern PSN.
When you login to your PSN account while on  one of our Sites, the PSN ToSUA and Privacy Policy also apply to your  activities on that Site to the extent they do not conflict with these Terms of  Service.
Except for any internet fees  that you are responsible for, creating a PSN account is free, so we encourage  you to do so.
3.
==========
USE  OF YOUR INFORMATION 
We respect your information and privacy and will not  publicly disclose your personal information to non-affiliated third parties  other than as stated in our Privacy  Policy.
By using our Sites, you acknowledge that we  are not responsible for any personal information that you publicly disclose  (intentionally or unintentionally) using the Sites’ services such as through  discussion forums or message boards.
You should avoid saying anything  personally identifying in these areas of our Sites.
==========
If you use our Sites you also agree that through your use of  the Sites, you may be provided with information about SCEA’s or a third party’s  products or services, including promotions, advertisements, product placements  or marketing materials within the Sites.
You acknowledge that SCEA does not  endorse any of the products or services advertised, promoted or marketed by  third parties.
4.
==========
OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT ON SITES 
Everything  on or used in connection with our Sites, including text, images, graphics,  logos, audio and video content and software (collectively, “Content”) – with  the exception of User Generated Content as defined below – is owned by us or  our affiliates, subsidiaries, licensors or suppliers.
You may not modify, publish, transmit,  participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works or in any way  exploit any of the Content (including Content that the Sites enable you to  download or save) without our express permission.
Here’s what permission we do give you to  use the Content.
First, we give you  permission to use the Content to surf and view our Sites, which means  displaying or loading the Content on your computer in connection with typical  web browsing activity.
Second, we give  you permission to use the Content for your personal, non-commercial uses.
This means, however, that you do not have our  permission to distribute the Content, to publicly display the content, charge  any fee for it, use the Content to create your own website, construct a  database with the Content or replicate our Sites or any parts of it  elsewhere.
(We intend these only as  examples and are not an exhaustive list of things you can’t do with our  Content).
Regardless of the permissions we give you to use  the Content, we remain the sole owner of all the Content, and you do not  acquire any ownership rights in the Content by assembling, creating files,  downloading or saving any of it.
If we  have included an author attribution, a trademark or copyright notice or other  legal notices on the Content, you should not remove or alter any of these.
5.
==========
USER GENERATED CONTENT
Some of the Sites have tools that allow you to communicate with other users and to create, post, upload, share and distribute various forms of content for and in connection with the Sites, including pictures, photographs, videos and other information or materials (collectively, “User Generated Content”).
Keep in mind that User Generated Content does not include your blog and message board postings.
If you post your insights, ideas, opinions and comments on our blog  site or message boards, you cannot prevent SCEA or other members of the  community from using them, and you give your consent to SCEA and anyone  else to use your posts in any manner.
==========
A.        YOUR USE OF USER GENERATED CONTENT
It’s great  that users on our Sites can upload or share content with each other, but we do not authorize you to upload or share on our Sites certain items and content.
Do not create, transfer, share, send, submit,  post or upload any User Generated Content that:

Is protected by copyright, trademark,  patent or trade secret or subject to third-party proprietary rights, including  rights of privacy and publicity - unless you are or have permission from the  rightful owner;
Contains fraudulent statements or misrepresentations  that could damage us or any third party;
 Contains any statements or materials  that disparage, ridicule or scorn us or any third  party;
 Is obscene, defamatory, threatening,  harassing, predatory, pornographic, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive,  or encourages conduct that would violate any law or is otherwise inappropriate;
 Is an advertisement, solicitation of  business or engages in any commercial activity on the Sites;
 Is an impersonation of another person;
 Produces SPAM on or throughout the  Sites publicizing a product or event; or
 Violates any of the rules of Code of  Conduct (described below), these Terms of Service, the PSN ToSUA, Privacy  Policy or other agreements that we incorporate into these Terms of Service by reference.
B.         LICENSE FOR USER  GENERATED CONTENT
      
      If you post, upload or make available  any User Generated Content on our Sites, you will still own the User Generated  Content (assuming you have rights to own it) but you are giving us the right to  use your User Generated Content.
If you  create, transfer, share, send, submit, post or upload any User Generated  Content to our Sites, you grant us certain rights to use it (described below)  without getting your further permission or having to pay you for it.
In legal terms, by transferring, sharing, sending, submitting, posting, uploading or making available User Generated Content on these Sites, you grant SCEA a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and fully sub-licensable license to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, adapt, translate, archive, store, and create derivative works from your User Generated Content, in any form, format or medium of any kind now known or later developed, both on these Sites and other online locations, and in other forms or media off the Internet.
You waive any moral rights you might have with respect to any User Generated Content you provide to us.
In addition, by transferring, sharing,  sending, submitting, posting, uploading or making available User Generated Content on these Sites,  you acknowledge that other users of the Sites may use your User Generated  Content.
==========
SCEA is not responsible for  enforcing any rights you may have with respect to your User Generated Content  against other users.
If you have a  dispute with another user of the Sites, you are responsible for contacting the other  user directly; do not contact SCEA.
C.        SCREENING AND REMOVAL OF USER GENERATED  CONTENT
SCEA may  or may not pre-screen User Generated Content.
==========
SCEA has the right (but not the obligation)  to move, remove, block, edit, or refuse to post any User Generated Content for any reason, including that User  Generated Content violates these Terms of  Service or other applicable terms, rules or agreements between you and us.
D.        RISK FROM USER GENERATED CONTENT 
We cannot and do not monitor or manage  all User Generated Content.
We therefore do not make any promises about  the accuracy, integrity or quality of User Generated Content and do not endorse it in any  manner.
==========
In other words, enjoy what other  members post or share, but do it at your own risk.
All User Generated Content made  available on the Sites is the sole responsibility of the person who provided  it.
This means that you are entirely  responsible for all User Generated Content that you provide.
6.
==========
YOUR COPYRIGHTED WORK
Just  as Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. (“SCEA”) requires users of our  Sites to respect our copyrights and those of our affiliates, licensors and  business partners, we respect the copyrights of others.
To that end, we have  adopted this Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act (“Copyright Act”) (17 U.S.C. 512 et seq.).
Once  SCEA’s representative who has been designated to receive notification of  claimed copyright infringement (“Designated Agent”) – whose name and contact  information is noted below – receives proper notice of the alleged  infringement, or if SCEA otherwise comes to believe in good faith that any specific  content, including user generated content, on the Sites contain material that  infringes copyright (“Disputed Content”), SCEA may (1) promptly remove or block  access to the Disputed Content or (2) deny access to the Sites to users that  repeatedly violate copyright or other intellectual property rights.
SCEA will  take reasonable steps to notify a user who has uploaded Disputed Content if  that Disputed Content is subsequently removed or disabled.
Procedure  for Reporting Copyright Infringement:
If  you believe in good faith that your copyrighted work has been reproduced on the  Site without authorization in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,  you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may notify our Designated  Agent:
Riley Russell
      Legal & Business Affairs Department
      Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.
919 East Hillside Blvd., 2nd Floor
      Foster City, CA 94404
      By phone: 650-655-8000
      By email: infringement@playstation.sony.com
Pursuant  to federal law, your notice must include the following information: 

 A  physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the  owner of the copyright that you alleged is being infringed;


 Identification  of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed, or, if multiple  copyrighted works on the Site are included in a single notification, a  representative list of all those works on the Site;


 Identification  of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of  infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be  disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider  to locate the material;


 Your  contact information, including address, telephone number, and, if available,  email address;


A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which SCEA is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.
A  statement made under penalty of perjury that the information in the  notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the  owner of an exclusive right under the Copyright Act that is allegedly  infringed.
==========
Supplying  a Counter-Notice Regarding Alleged Copyright Infringement
If  you are the provider of the Disputed Content and believe a copyright  infringement notice has been wrongly submitted against you as a result of  mistake or a misidentification of the claimed copyrighted material, you may  send a counter-notification to our Designated Agent (whose address is included  in Paragraph 1 above).
The counter notification must provide the following  information:

 Physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;
 Identification of the Disputed Content that has been removed or to which access has been  disabled, and the location where the Disputed Content appeared before it was  removed or access to it was disabled;
 A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the Disputed  Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification;
 Your name,  address, telephone number and, if available, email address; and
A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States  District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or  if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial  district in which SCEA is located, and that you will accept service of  process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such  person.
If  our Designated Agent receives a counter-notice from you, SCEA will send a copy  of it to the original complaining party informing that person or entity that  SCEA may replace the removed Disputed Content or cease disabling access to it.
==========
Please note that when we forward the counter-notice, it includes your personal  information.
By submitting a counter-notice, you consent to having your  information revealed in this way.
We will not forward the counter-notice to any  party other than the complaining party.
Unless  the Designated Agent receives notice from the original complaining party that  the original complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to  restrain the user who posted the Disputed Content from engaging in infringing  activity relating to the Disputed Content on the Site, SCEA will replace or  restore access to the Disputed Content on the Site or permit the user to  re-post the Disputed Content.
7.
==========

PSN ACCOUNT REGISTRATION
Through  PSN, you can participate in SCEA’s online community, play games online, and  purchase content and services, such as new levels for your favorite games,  movies, television shows or original programs such as Qore™.
PSN may not be available, or may not be  supported, in some countries and some languages.
You must create a PSN account in order to access PSN’s content  and services.
SCEA reserves the right to  deny the creation of any account at its discretion and for any reason.
==========
Currently, there are no charges for creating  a PSN account, but there may be charges associated with certain online content  or services that are available through PSN.
All information provided during PSN account registration must be  truthful and accurate.
There are two  types of PSN accounts:  Master Accounts  and Sub Accounts.
All PSN accounts have  an associated PSN mailbox for receiving text mail.
==========
If  you are 18 years or older, you can create a Master Account for yourself.
Each Master Account can create up to six (6)  associated Sub Accounts.
You are not  permitted to create Sub Accounts for persons under the age of 18 who are not  your children or for whom you are not the legal guardian.
A  Master Account has access to and control over the following aspects of its Sub  Accounts: (i) financial aspects; (ii) content availability and (iii) certain  chat features.
==========
Text mail from SCEA that  relates to a Sub Account’s purchases on PSN will be sent to the mailbox of the  associated Master Account.
At its sole  discretion, SCEA may send text mail to the Master Account relating to the Sub  Account’s other activities on PSN.
A  child under 18 can only have a Sub Account associated with a Master Account of  the child’s parent or legal guardian.
If you are creating a Sub Account for  a child under the age of 13, you must provide (i) your consent for SCEA to  disclose, pursuant to SCEA’s privacy policy, your child’s personally  identifying information to third parties for the purpose of allowing your child  to participate in PSN activities, such as video and voice chat and gameplay; and  (ii) your credit card information.
==========
Your  credit card will be used to verify parental consent under laws requiring such consent.
You will not be charged a fee for creating  the Sub Account.
If you do not consent  to the disclosure of this requested information, you will not be able to create  a Sub Account for the child.
If all  requested information is provided, a separate email containing a code will be  sent to the Master Account’s email account with instructions to complete  registration by entering the code into the Sub Account using a personal  computer.
You will need to create for your  child an Online ID that will be associated with the child’s PSN Sub  Account.
Please note that the Online ID  is publicly available to and viewable by all PSN users and your child may  receive text emails from any PSN users, including adults, in your child’s PSN account mailbox.
The parent’s Master Account will not be notified of such text  emails sent to a child’s Sub Account mailbox.
As the parent or legal guardian, it is  your sole responsibility to monitor your child's access to or use of PSN, as  well as any communications made or received by your child on or through PSN.
==========
Some  content and services may be objectionable or inappropriate to some users,  including children under a certain age.
Please consider your child’s age and check any product, content or  service ratings and descriptions where available, before you access, download  or purchase any items or permit your child to do so.
In some cases, third parties provide ratings or descriptions for  items, and SCEA therefore cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such  information.
In addition, not all  content and services are rated.
==========
Some  content that you download to your PLAYSTATION®3  computer entertainment system or PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system may be  accessible by all users of that system.
Please monitor all access to content, services, and communications that  may be objectionable or age inappropriate.
PSN parental controls will not apply to certain types of services or  content such as content that is considered streamed material, user  communication or certain categories of downloadable content.
PSN parental controls may also not apply to  some content that is not rated.
Your  child may not be able to access some content or services or play games rated  for users older than his or her registered age.
In some countries, parents and legal guardians with Master  Accounts will be permitted to set their parental controls to override content  restrictions on certain materials for associated Sub Accounts.
==========
Please see the Knowledge Base located at the following website for  more information: http://playstation.custhelp.com/.
A  Master Account can also create Sub Accounts for people over the age of 18.
Credit card information is not required to  create a Sub Account for someone over 18.
==========
Adult Sub Account holders must accept this Terms of Service and User  Agreement and the applicable Privacy Policy themselves.
The Master Account holder is jointly and  severally legally and financially responsible for the actions of his or her Sub  Account holders on PSN, regardless of their age.
Both  Master Account and Sub Account holders select their own Online ID, Sign-In ID  and password to gain access to their accounts.
