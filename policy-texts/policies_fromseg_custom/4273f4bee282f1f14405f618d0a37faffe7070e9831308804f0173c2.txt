Membership fees are fully earned upon payment.
==========
We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled.
In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate.

==========
Your Renewal Date is subject to change due to changes in your membership.
Visit the "My Dashboard" page on the Site to see the commencement date for your next Renewal Date.

Promotions and Redemption Codes.
We may offer a promotion, contest or coupon code that will provide a discount on your membership subscription.

Redemption codes are non-transferable, may only be used once and cannot be combined with other codes or redeemed for cash.
The validity of redemption codes may depend on the status of the member who redeems it.
For example, an existing subscriber may not redeem a code providing a discount for a new subscription.
Redemption codes may have an expiration date, after which time the code will not be valid or accepted by the Site.
Redemption codes are provided for your use only, and you agree that you will not share any redemption codes with others, including by emailing codes to friends or family, sharing codes on social networking sites, or posting codes to third party websites that are not our Site unless we provide written approval via email or on our Site to do so.

A discount provided via a redemption code is only valid during your paid subscription.
If you cancel your subscription, you also cancel the discount from the redemption code.
Reactivating your subscription will not reactivate the discount from the redemption code; nor will it allow you to redeem a code for a discount for new subscribers.
If you receive a promotion code through an offer from a third party, additional restrictions may apply.

Certain promotions may have additional terms or requirements to satisfy to become eligible, such as promotions that authorize Users to obtain a refund if unsatisfied with the Service within a limited time of the commencement of the subscription.
Any such additional terms and requirements, such as requirements that you use a particular process or submit certain additional information, or take certain steps within a designated time period, will be made available to you at the time you redeem the promotion

No refunds will be given in any circumstances, subject to any written promotional program refunds, as described above.

At any time and for any reason, however, we may provide credits, discounts, or other considerations to some or all of our members ("Membership Credits").
The amount and form of such Membership Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.
==========
The provision of Membership Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Membership Credits in the future for similar instances; nor does it obligate us to provide Membership Credits in the future, under any circumstance.
One such reason for Membership Credit may be if you upgrade or downgrade your membership plan.
You may receive a pro-rated Membership Credit or charge, as applicable, of the previously paid monthly or annual fee for the remaining days of that month or year, to be applied against the new subscription amount to be charged to your Payment Method on your Renewal Date.

Educational Institution Relationships and Guidance
Our site and service include a variety of content related to educational institutions such as colleges and universities, some of whom we have contractual relationships.
For example, we have relationships with many institutions that provide the ability for our users to transfer credits received through our service to satisfy such institutions' degree requirements.
==========
Some institutions may also provide us with payments or other incentives when we refer prospective students.
We may also provide information through our site and services about institutions with whom we have no relationship.
While we strive to provide content, information, and guidance that is useful and relevant, it is important that you are aware of our affiliations and relationships with these institutions, and the relationship between the products and services that we offer (including our various informational, guidance, and recommendation services as well as our course offerings) and the institutions we may reference on our site.
By providing us with information about yourself and your educational interest and goals, you are authorizing us to provide that information to institutions (including institutions we have a relationship with) that may have programs or offerings that we determine may be a match or otherwise of interest.
It is important to note that we are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or otherwise related to such institutions, nor does the publication of information about any institution through our service indicate any affiliation, endorsement, or recommendation by us of any such institutions.
==========
Some of our services include the ability to obtain certain information, analysis, forecasting, planning, and other types of resources that you can use to consider, refine, and develop your own educational goals and associated plans.
The information and analysis we provide is based on a variety of inputs, including information you provide, information available from public sources (such as educational institutions' own publications, third party guides, and other similar services), and estimates based on a variety of assumptions.
You understand and agree that our ability to provide useful tools and information is limited by the information available to us (including information that you provide), and accordingly we cannot and do not make any representation or warranty that any information or analysis provided through our services are accurate, complete, or up to date.
Specifically, you understand that calculations as to the time or cost associated with a particular degree program at a particular institution or combination of institutions (including combining use of our services and the degree programs of other institutions) assumes a variety of factors, including taking a full course load, and a variety of details remaining unchanged for the duration of the program, including tuition and other costs, financial aid availability and eligibility, degree requirements, course availability, transfer credit availability, and other similar details.
==========
Further, any "ratings" we issue are meant to be approximations of how a particular option might fit against the goals and requirements you have told us about - scores are imperfect estimates, and are provided for convenience and are not meant to be absolute rankings.
Because of the wide variation of the individual experiences of students in their educational paths, we cannot and do not guarantee or predict any particular results, and we cannot and do not make any representations or warranties that your results will be the same or similar as any of the estimates provided through our service.
An educational plan is a highly personal exercise, unique to each person, and no single source can give you definitive guidance.
You should use your common sense and good judgment in evaluating your options, and considering the resources we provide as a part of your overall research and decision making process.
We are here to help!

If you do not want us to have this access, you should not consent to receive support through the remote access tool, and we will attempt to assist you through other means.

==========
Mandatory Arbitration
a. Generally.
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and us in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 17.
b, below, you and Study.com agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.
==========
Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
==========
This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND STUDY.COM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION TO ADDRESS CLAIMS ARISING HEREUNDER.
==========
b. Exceptions.
Despite the provisions of Section 17.
==========
a, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
c. Arbitrator.
==========
Any arbitration between you and Study.com hereunder will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, "AAA Rules") as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting us directly.
The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
==========
d. Notice of Arbitration; Process.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice of Arbitration").
Study.com's address for Notice is: Study.com, Attn: Legal Department, 100 View Street, Suite 202, Mountain View, CA 94041.
==========
The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Study.com may commence an arbitration proceeding.
All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
==========
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Study.com must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Study.com in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Study.com will pay to you the higher of: (A) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (B) $5,000.
==========
e. Fees.
If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $5,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, CA, but if the claim is for $5,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, you agree to reimburse Study.com for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
==========
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
==========
f. No Class Actions.
YOU AND STUDY.COM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER HEREUNDER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Study.com agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
==========
g. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.
If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Study.com will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
==========
h. Enforceability.
If Section 17.
f or the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, or if we receive an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 21 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
18.
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each and all of the Study.com Parties from and against all and any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to (a) your violation of these Terms of Service, (b) your use of the Site or Mobile App, (c) your noncompliance with any law, and (d) any rights of a third party related to User Content that you post or information you otherwise make available to us or through the Services, including, without limitation, any claim of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property or other proprietary rights.

Instant Answers and Tutoring
To make sure you get the most out of Instant Answers and Tutoring Services, we want to help you understand what it is for and how to use it.
==========
Follow our instructions to obtain the answers you need while also exercising academic honesty.
When submitting questions to Instant Answers or to Tutors, please:
Don't use Instant Answers or Tutors to do your homework (or write your essay) for you.
==========
We're here to help you study and understand concepts you're struggling with.
We can answer your questions and direct you to lessons that you'll find useful, but you agree not to simply copy and paste the answers we give you.
Don't write one-word questions.
Make sure you're giving our instructors enough detail and context so that they can provide a meaningful response.
==========
Don't put multiple questions in one submission.
Each question should be submitted in its own ticket so we can deliver your questions to the correct subject matter experts.
==========
Don't use Instant Answers or Tutors in any way that violates the rules of your assignment, classroom, or academic institution.
This would include plagiarizing or using outside help when you're instructed not to.
==========
Cheating
We all know that cheating is bad, and there are a lot of reasons not to cheat!
Let's look at a few of them:
First, the person who is the most hurt when you cheat is you.
Seriously!
==========
Cheating on your homework means that you won't learn the material, which will hurt you in your current class and in the future.
Homework and essays are a great way to learn and think about the material, and cheating will only hurt you in the long run.
==========
Second, all teachers and academic institutions take cheating seriously.
If you're caught cheating on your homework or plagiarizing your answers or essay from another source, you will likely face serious consequences.
In some cases, you might just receive a zero on the assignment, but in others, plagiarism can result in an automatic failure in your class, or maybe even expulsion from your school depending on the academic honesty policy in place.
Third, now more than ever, it's really easy to get caught for cheating!
==========
Copying answers from a page on the internet might seem like a quick way to complete your homework, but it's just as easy for your teacher to find those exact phrases with a simple Internet search.
It's important for you to think about the information you're reading and phrase it in your own words, rather than simply copying from outside sources.
PLEASE PRINT AND RETAIN A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR YOUR RECORDS.
