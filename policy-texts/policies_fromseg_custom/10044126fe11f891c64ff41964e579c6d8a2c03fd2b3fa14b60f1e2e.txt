Privacy Policy Effective starting: March 26, 2014 (view archived versions)  Introduction This Privacy Policy explains what information Atlassian Pty Ltd and its related entities ("Atlassian") collect about you and why, what we do with that information, how we share it, and how we handle the content you place in our products and services.
Scope of Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of "Atlassian Services" via a "Device" or when you otherwise interact with Atlassian.
"Atlassian Services" include our:  Websites SaaS Products Downloadable Products  but does not include:  Atlassian products or services for which a separate privacy policy is provided.
==========
Third party products.
These are third party products or services that you may choose to integrate with Atlassian product or services, such as third party Add-Ons available in the Atlassian Marketplace.
You should always review the policies of third party products and services to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect and use your information.
==========
A "Device" is any computer used to access the Atlassian Services, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.
Unless otherwise stated, our SaaS Products and our Downloadable Products are treated the same for the purposes of this document.
By registering for or using Atlassian Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

Changes to our Privacy Policy We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in some cases, where appropriate we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the login screen or sending you an email notification).
We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you use Atlassian Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy, you will need to stop using Atlassian Services and deactivate your account(s).
==========
Information you provide to us We collect the following information: Account and Profile Information: We collect information about you and your company as you register for an account, create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with Atlassian Services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share Content).
Information we collect includes but is not limited to your name, username, address, email address, phone number, profile photo, job title, or credit card details.
You may provide this information directly when you enter it in Atlassian Services, or in some cases another user (such as a system administrator) creating an account on your behalf may provide it (most commonly when your company requests that you use our products).
==========
If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you confirm that you have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Content: We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our SaaS Products or Websites.
Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive information that you choose to include (“passively-collected Personal Information”).
Other submissions: We collect other data that you submit to our Websites or as you participate in any interactive features of the Atlassian Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us.
For example, information regarding a problem you are experiencing with an Atlassian product could be submitted to our Support Services or posted in our public forums.
Any information, including Personal Information, that you submit to our Websites could be visible to the public unless submitted to a secure area in the Website.
Information we collect from your use of Atlassian Services Web Logs: As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Websites and SaaS Products.
==========
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information.
In the case of our SaaS Product, the URLs you accessed (and therefore included in our log files) include usernames as well as elements of Content (such as JIRA project names, project keys, status names, and JQL filters, and Confluence page titles and space names) as necessary for the SaaS Product to perform the requested operations.
Occasionally, we connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve Atlassian Services for individual customers.
Analytics Information from Website and SaaS Products: We and our analytics provider collect and store analytics information when you use our Websites and SaaS Products to help us improve our products and services.
In the Saas Products, this analytics information consists of the feature and function of the Atlassian Service being used, the associated license identifier (SEN) and domain name, the username and IP address of the individual who is using the feature or function (which will include Personal Information if the Personal Information was incorporated into the username), the sizes and original filenames of attachments, and additional information required to detail the operation of the function and which parts of the Atlassian Services are being affected.
For example:  In JIRA, analytics information that we collect when a user creates a project includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the project, the project key input by the user, the name of the template used (if any), and the name of the project.
Similarly, analytics information that we collect when an issue is edited includes the system-assigned numeric issue id, the issue key (which consists of the project key and a system-generated sequence number), whether the edit is made by a user or automatically generated by the system, and whether email notifications are to be sent.
In Confluence, analytics information that we collect when a user creates a page includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the page, the blueprint used to create the page, the key of the space in which the page is being created, and the page title.
An example of analytics information that we collect when a user creates a new blueprint includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the blueprint, the key of the space in which the blueprint is being created, and the blueprint name and description.
As shown in the examples above, the analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing.
As such, the analytics information we collect may include Personal Information or sensitive business information that the user has included in Content that the user chose to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an Atlassian Service.
==========
As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics as an analytics provider.
To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, refer to Google's Policies and Principles.
Use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent to analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics.
Analytics Information Derived from Content.
Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data.
"Usage Data" is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information.
==========
For example, we may query Content to determine the most common types of workflows that users use (e.g. what percentage of all instances use ITIL style workflows?)
by searching for the most common workflow names, or we may query Content to determine the most popular job titles for Confluence users in order to better understand the composition of our user base.
Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends.
It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.
==========
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies that we save to your computer or mobile device.
Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory.
We use cookies to improve and customize Atlassian Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Websites or SaaS Products without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Websites and SaaS Products are most popular.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Websites or SaaS Products.
We also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels").
Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Websites or SaaS Products or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
==========
Software Updates & License Information from Downloadable Products:  Our Downloadable Products communicate with Atlassian servers for licensing purposes, as well as to check for updates, patches, and compatibility with Add-Ons.
Examples of information we collect for these purposes include the name and version of the Downloadable Product and the server ID, SEN, and IP address of the customer instance.
Information we collect from other sources Information from third party services: We also obtain information from third parties and combine that with information we collect through Atlassian Services.
For example, we may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if you log into Atlassian Services through the service or otherwise provide us with access to information from the service.
Any access that we may have to such information from a third party social or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service.
By authorizing us to connect with a third party service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the third party service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
