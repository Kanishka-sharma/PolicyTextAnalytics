Xero will never access the details of any financial transaction entered and stored in the Service.
Xero will never access system usage history for a specific identifiable user, except where granted permission by that person to assist with resolution of a system issue or error.
Xero staff and key commercial partners can access non-identifying and aggregated usage information and transaction volumes in order to better understand how our customers are using the Service so we can improve the system design and where appropriate have the system prompt users with suggestions on ways to improve their own use of the system.

All aggregated usage information is stored in a secure Xero data warehouse facility.
Your Data is sent securely across the Internet
Xero's servers have SSL Certificates issued by leading certificate authorities Entrust & GTE Cybertrust, so all Data transferred between users and the Service is encrypted.

However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment.
Users should only enter, or instruct the importation of, Data to the database within a secure environment.
This means that Your browser must support the encryption security used in connection with the Service.

Xero stores your Data in the location Xero considers will give You the most efficient access from wherever in the world You may be.
Access and storage controls via the Service are however administered by Xero in New Zealand as the custodian of that Data (Xero's address and contact details are here).
Where You access or input Data from somewhere other than the country where the Data is stored or to be stored, You consent to that Data being transferred from one country to the other (including via any intermediate country) as a function of transmission across the Internet.
