At Ookla, we recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important.
Here are details on what types of personal data we collect when you use and visit Speedtest.net and how we safeguard it.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
==========
Registration Information
Registering an account at Speedtest.net requires only a valid email address.
We may email you with information related to Speedtest.net, but we will never give your email address to others.
Test Results
We store the result of each test that is run on Speedtest.net.
==========
This data includes your IP (Internet protocol) address, web browser information and actual result numbers for the test.
Outside of your IP address, none of the information we collect can be identified as belonging to you.
Location Information
We use geolocation data to determine where you are based completely on your IP address.
You are also given the ability to refine this information using Google's Location Service.
The information obtained is similarly only associated with your IP address.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.
This includes settings such as which server you prefer to use.
==========
Cookies are also used to track what advertisements you have seen on the site.
We also use some third party advertisements on Speedtest.net.
Some of these advertisers may use cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address and the web browser you used to visit our site.
This data is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York broadband ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
==========
Google specifically uses something called a DoubleClick DART cookie to accomplish this.
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
You can also choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your web browser settings.
However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.
