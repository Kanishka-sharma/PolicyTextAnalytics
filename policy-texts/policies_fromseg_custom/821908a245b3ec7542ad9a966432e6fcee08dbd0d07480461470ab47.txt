The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
As of May 25, 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation
                            (the “GDPR”) will be in effect through the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK.
==========
This requires Pokkt
                            and those using our services to provide users with certain information about the processing
                            of their “Personal Data”.
“Personal Data” is a term used under the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies a
                            particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, cookie identifiers,
                            Mobile IDs, precise location data, and biometric data.
==========
To comply with the GDPR, we provide the following information, which are specific to users located in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK.
Legal Grounds for Lawful Processing of Personal Data
The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we are relying on to process any Personal Data about you.
Typical legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data are:

You have given your consent.
==========
In order to store and gain access to information
                                        stored on your device, we rely on your consent.
For this “cookie consent” (which
                                        applies not only to “cookies” but also to Mobile IDs), we rely on publishers and
                                        oblige them contractually to pass on only legally obtained data.
We do so to
                                        fulfil our obligations under the ePrivacy Directive.
We might ask for consent in
                                        other cases as well, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to
                                        such consent and its withdrawal.
==========
The processing is in our legitimate scope.
In few scenarios, we rely on
                                        legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data, in order to
                                        provide our and/or other data controllers’ services.
Such processing goes beyond
                                        the original collection of Mobile Identifiers.
A valid use case is the
                                        customising of promotional communications within mobile applications and
                                        services, which is beneficial to End Users and is an integral part of the
                                        ecosystem by which freely available content is funded through advertising
                                        revenue.
This also may include providing analysis of and reporting about ad
                                        campaigns.
==========
Contractual relationships.
Sometimes, we process certain data as necessary under a contractual relationship we have (such as our customer records and contact information).
Legal obligations.
Finally, some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
==========
Transfers of Personal Data
As Pokkt works with global companies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided.
When we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take
                                    steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data.
Please contact us for more information about the checks we have put in place to
                                    protect your Personal Data.
Personal Data Retention
We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide our Pokkt Ad
                                    Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations,
                                    resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
==========
We generally render Mobile IDs
                                    inactive within 24 months, provided that we may retain them if we have a legal or
                                    significant operational need to do so, such as for auditing, corporate
                                    record-keeping, compliance accounting, or bug-fixes.
If you are a Client of ours and thus have an account with us, we will typically
                                    retain your Personal Data for a period of 3 years after you have requested that your
                                    account be closed, or such account has been inactive.
==========
Your Rights as a Data Subject

                                    controllers hold about you, including certain rights to access Personal Data, to

                                    Data, and to object to our processing of your Personal Data (including profiling for

We will then assess requests to exercise data access rights on a case-by-case
                                        basis; in doing so, we consider the difficulty of verifying whether a mobile
                                        identifier and data we have linked to it truly and solely belongs to the data
                                        subject making the request, as well as the potential adverse effects on
                                        disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual.
Right to Correct: If you wish to exercise your right to correct Personal Data, you may do so by contacting us at the contact information below.
==========

                                        device).
We will also manually delete your Personal Data, subject our identity

Pokkt as a Data Controller and a Data Processor
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process
                                    Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations
                                    that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data
                                    processors”).
Pokkt may act as either a data controller or a data processor in handling your
                                    Personal Data, depending on the precise circumstances.
For instance, for Personal
                                    Data that we collect and use for self purpose to create our own tools and operate
                                    the Pokkt Ad System, we are a data controller.
When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our Clients or Partners in order
                                    to provide our services to them, we are a data processor.
For example if you have
                                    queries about data that is used primarily by a mobile app in which our SDK is
                                    integrated – or companies that serve ads that use our technology – you should
                                    contact those companies regarding questions about the Personal Data they handle and
                                    control.
