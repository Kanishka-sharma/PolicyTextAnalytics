Summary 
                    of information that Seagate gathers online
                    Seagate collects three types of information from users who visit our 
                    web sites: (1) information gathered by analyzing page views and user 
                    navigation patterns, (2) information that users provide directly when 
                    they use various Seagate services or participate in various Seagate 
                    programs, and (3) information that users provide prior to purchasing 
                    Seagate products online.
We 
                    use page view and navigation information to ensure that users can find 
                    information on our web sites as quickly as possible.
We collect demographic 
                    information through promotional programs to better identify the products 
                    and services that will fulfill users' needs.
Finally, we use information 
                    collected when users make online purchases to check their qualifications, 
                    verify their identity, as well as for billing and shipping purposes.
Methods 
                    Seagate uses for gathering information Usage Tracking
                    Seagate analyzes user traffic patterns throughout our web sites.
We 
                    do not attempt to identify individual visitors to our web sites, but 
                    we may collect data on general types of users based on domain name 
                    or browser type.
This information is obtained directly from the user's 
                    web browser identification information.

Special 
                    programs
                    When a user registers for certain Seagate programs and services, the 
                    user may be asked to provide contact information, demographic information, 
                    or billing information.
Polls 
                    and surveys
                    Some Seagate web sites include polls in which users are asked to indicate 
                    their opinions or preferences.
In addition to compiling the responses 
                    to survey questions, Seagate may use cookies to identify those users 
                    who have already participated in a poll.
We use this system to ensure 
                    that each visitor's opinion will be represented equally.

Contests 
                    and Sweepstakes
                    Seagate offers voluntary contests and sweepstakes in which we request 
                    certain personal information from the user.
At a minimum, our contests 
                    require at least an email address and contact information, but on occasion 
                    we will require mandatory information about other topics.
We use this 
                    information both to verify a user's identity and delivery location 
                    and to gain feedback as to what contests and sweepstakes may interest 
                    the user in the future.
Seagate does not sell or give away the names 
                    of our customers, but with your prior consent, we may share your information 
                    with other companies to provide additional services to better meet 
                    your needs.
