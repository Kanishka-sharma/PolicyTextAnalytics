What This Privacy Policy Covers
Intent Global, Inc (“Intent,” “we,” or “us”) helps brands analyze online visitors and deliver tailored content and advertising to people (“Users,” “you,” or “your”) as they use the internet.
This document describes Intent privacy practices as they pertain to our corporate websites and any customer extranet (the “Site”); our advertising technology service (the “Advertising Service” or “Intent Global Inc”); our online personalization and customization service (the “Site Customization Service”); our predictive analytics service (“Analytics Service”); collectively “Services”; and how we collect and use consumer data.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies and online properties not under the control of Intent or to individuals that Intent does not employ or manage.
Please note that in most cases we serve as a data processor for other companies’ data.
In those cases we are bound by the contractual requirements agreed to with those data controllers, and we refer you to their privacy policies.
Intent is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Code.
Intent also complies with the Digital Advertising Alliance Principles in the U.S. and Canada, and adheres to the IAB Europe OBA Framework.
==========
What Information We Collect
Personal Data
Personal data is information that can be used to identify an individual.
We process personal data that Users enter on our Site, send to us via email, or voluntarily provide to us in any other way.
Registering to become a customer of Intent (our “Clients”) requires the submission of personal data, including name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, website URL, credit card, and/or other payment information.
Our Site, Advertising Service, Personalization Service, and Analytics Service do not intentionally collect information that directly reveals your real-world identity, such as your name, address, phone number, or Social Security Number.
==========
Intent collects online identifiers and IP addresses through the use of cookies, web-beacons and other similar technologies, as explained below.
In some jurisdictions in which we operate, pseudonymous online identifiers and IP addresses are considered personal data.
Sensitive Information
Intent does not collect any of the following data in connection with the Services: social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers; insurance plan numbers; financial account numbers; information that describes the real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices (though we do collect IP addresses, which can provide approximate geographic location); information about a user’s sexual proclivity, or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic, and family medical history.
We also do not collect special categories of data from EU data subjects such as race, health conditions, alienage or trade union membership.
==========
Device-Identified Consumer Data
Device-identified information is information that generally can’t be used by us to identify you personally.
In some jurisdictions, device identifiers are categorized as personal data.
We may collect device-identified data in connection with our Site and Services including but not limited to a User’s purchasing intent, usage information, transaction information, login and visitor identifiers, IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.
In mobile applications where we have a presence, we may also collect mobile advertising identifiers such as IDFA and Google AdID.
Cross-Device Advertising
In some cases, we are able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or mobile device should be associated with the same identifier that we have previously assigned to another computer or mobile device.
In other words, in such cases, we are able to infer that a device (e.g. your computer) and another device (e.g. your smartphone) are used by the same user.
Where we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices and to improve the services we provide to our clients.
We refer to this as cross-device advertising.
Data Integrity
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.
==========
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
How Collected Information Is Used
The data that Intent collects are used to better predict responses to custom content, to help determine which content performs best, and to evaluate which content is most appropriate for a given User.
The data may also be used to target advertisements and other content to people on the Client online properties they visit.
We may also share predictive scores of Users with the Client on whose property the User is visiting for the Client to use for personalization of content or advertisements, to optimize other Client advertising campaigns, or for other purposes the Client determines.
In addition, we may use the data to analyze trends, administer the Site and the Services, customize the advertising and content, track Users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Intent operates as an agent, service provider and/or data processor with respect to data received from our Clients and do not sell the data pursuant to providing the Services.
We only use User data collected from an advertiser or publisher’s site to perform services for that advertiser or publisher.
In some cases, we may use data from both an advertiser and a publisher to perform services for both parties by serving the advertiser’s ad on the publisher’s site, but we will not use data from an advertiser or a publisher ourselves or to perform services for others.
If a User voluntarily provides Intent with personal data in an email or by completing an online form, we use that personal data only to contact such User to respond to such User’s inquiry.
We use personal data of Clients to service accounts.
We may use personal data of users on our Site for our own corporate marketing purposes.
==========
Sharing with Third Parties, Onward Transfer
We may employ third-party agents and service providers to process payments, to facilitate the Services, to perform operational services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, cloud hosting services, logging services, code monitoring services, web analytics and improvement of the Services’ features), to provide productivity services (e.g., email), for our own business-to-business corporate marketing and CRM efforts, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used.
These third parties may have access to information we’ve collected but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Intent may share aggregate information (which does not include device-identified information or personal data) about Clients and Users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

We do not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights.
Moreover, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would violate applicable law.
==========
Legal Basis within the European Union
We process personal data for our Site based on user consent (art. 6(1)(a) GDPR), for entering into and the performance of a contract with our customers (art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and based on legitimate interests (art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).

For personal data of data subjects located in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, we reserve the right to use valid transfer mechanisms such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.
==========
Cookies and other Targeting Technologies
Intent employs “cookies” and web beacons in connection with providing the Site and the Services.
Cookies are small packets of data, which may include a pseudonymous unique identifier, that are sent to a User’s browser from a server and stored on the User’s computer’s hard drive.
The online property placing the cookie on the User’s computer can then recognize the computer when the User navigates the online property at a later time.
For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
Intent may use cookies, web beacons, and JavaScript for the purposes of helping us better understand when an internet User has seen or clicked on an advertisement or visited a web page.
These technologies help us tailor advertising messages served via the Services, to measure online page views and visits, and to support ad delivery and reporting purposes.
Users always have the option to prevent the use of cookies on their computers by changing the setting on their internet browsers to block cookies.
In addition, Users have the option to block the use of JavaScript, which may be used by Intent to display advertisements.
Since each internet browser is different, for more information, each User should review the documentation regarding the User’s specific browser.
Users are encouraged to review their privacy choices below under the section entitled “Choice / Opt-out.”
Users should be aware, however, that blocking the use of cookies or JavaScript may affect the User’s ability to access the functionality and content of certain websites and other online properties.
Data Retention
The cookies we set in connection with the Services expire after no more than thirteen months, and the expiration date may update every time you encounter our server.
Only our opt-out cookie (see below) has a different expiration date.
==========
We retain our raw log data, which includes data from the web and from mobile applications from which we receive data, for two years to help us understand historical seasonality trends.
We retain our aggregated data, which contains no pseudonymous identifiers or personal data, indefinitely.
Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use.
This also includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption.
Any data that is stored on Intent servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public.
Intent has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs.
==========
No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Please send questions about security to the address in the section “Contacting Us.”
==========
Choice / Opt-out
If you’d like to opt out from having Intent personalize your ads and site content in connection with the Services, please click here.
When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer, which tells our Services not to use your data to target advertisements or site modifications on your device, and, in Europe, not to process personal data as defined there.
Note that you may still receive advertisements or site modifications based on other factors such as your geography and the content of the online property you are visiting.
You may also opt out of Intent Global Inc’s behavioral advertising and other companies’ behavioral advertising at YourOnlineChoices.eu in Europe, via the Network Advertising Initiative in the United States, or via YourAdChoices.ca in Canada.

==========
Rights of Access, Rectification, and Erasure of Information
Intent operates the Services as a data processor and service provider on behalf of its customers.
For access, rectification, or erasure of your information, please contact the owners of the online property where the data was collected, as they operate as the data controllers and/or (under California law) the business.
For full-browser-window advertisements hosted on the intentmedia.net domain, the privacy policy link in that browser window will link to the Intent Client acting as data controller for the data processed in that window.
The data controller will then be able to contact us to access, rectify, or erase information we maintain about you on their behalf.
For data subject requests for personal data that we control, please send us an inquiry to the address in the “Contacting Us” section below.
==========
Third-Party Sites
Intent Site or Services may permit Users to link to other online properties on the internet, and other online properties may contain links to the Site.
These other online properties are not under Intent ’s control and Intent is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such online properties.
