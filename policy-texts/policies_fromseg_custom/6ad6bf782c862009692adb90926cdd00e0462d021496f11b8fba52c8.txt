This notice explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.
==========
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites function, to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
Cookies set by the operator of a website (in this case, Matterport) are called “first party cookies”.
Cookies set by parties other than Matterport are called “third-party cookies”.
==========
Third-Party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Website (for example advertising, interactive content, interaction with social media sites, and analytics).
The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer or mobile device both when you visit our Website, and also when you visit certain other websites.
Why do we use cookies?
We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons.
==========
Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies.
Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience of our Service.
Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described below:

Use of Local Storage
Cookies are not the only way to store information on your computer or mobile device.
Matterport stores additional information that is essential to the functionality of the Services in local storage.

Local storage is similar to the storage of information in cookies, but never expires until our Services delete this information, or you delete it yourself.

Other tracking technologies
Cookies are not the only way to track visitors to a website.
Matterport and our third party partners may use other similar technologies such as clear GIFs (also known as “tracking pixels” and “web beacons”).
Clear GIFs are small graphics files that contain an identifier that recognizes when a user visits our Websites.
==========
This allows our third-party partners to monitor traffic patterns between websites, communicate with cookies, to understand if you have come from an advertisement displayed on a third party Website, to monitor the success of marketing campaigns and to improve site performance.
These technologies typically rely on cookies to function, so disabling cookies in your browser will impair their functionality.
