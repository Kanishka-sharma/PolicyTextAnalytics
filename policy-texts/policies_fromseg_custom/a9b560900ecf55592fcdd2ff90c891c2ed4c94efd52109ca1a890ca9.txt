Electronic Dictionary Warranties All products are covered by a one year warranty from their respective manufacturers in Japan.
White Rabbit Press acts only as a conduit to the manufacturer; in any of, but not limited to, the following events, manufacturers will not repair electronics free of charge: physical damage, dropping, spillage, electric shock, etc.
The manufacturer will act at their own discretion in these matters and White Rabbit Press is not responsible for their decisions.
The manufacturer is the final arbiter of all disputes and will charge for all repairs if they deem that any event that voided the warranty had occurred.
That said, all the manufacturers that we carry are among the world's largest companies and highly dedicated to providing great service.
