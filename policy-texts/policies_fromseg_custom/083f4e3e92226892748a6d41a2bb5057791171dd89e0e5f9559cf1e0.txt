For example, you provide information when you enter your bookmarks; provide annotations either for  private or public viewing; enter search terms; download and use our toolbar; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; and employ our other services.

As a result of those actions, you might supply us with personally identifiable information or information about things that interest you.
We use the information that you provide for such purposes as customizing the site for you, improving the site, responding to your requests, and communicating with you.

This includes, or may include in the future, personalization services, interactive communications, online communities and shopping, and many other types of services.
==========
In order to provide services free of charge, we will serve ads using content-targeting technologies, based on the content of your archived items.
Except where required to resolve technical problems or as set forth herein, no human will review your archived items or information related to you.
By knowing a little about you, Diigo is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.

You may edit your Account Information or Member Profile using your member name and password.

This helps ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safe-guard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
