Welcome!
Thank you for inquiring about Dotomi’s Intelligent-Retention™ and Intelligent-Acquisition™ services.
At Dotomi we take privacy seriously not only because we’re employees of the company, but we’re consumers too.
Because of this, we tend to do things a little differently – like creating a Privacy Policy that marketers and consumers can actually read AND understand!
==========
Our mission is simple: Provide consumers with advertisements that are relevant to their interests.
Our intention is to weed out irrelevant, sometimes obnoxious, ads and provide the consumer a better overall web experience.
At Dotomi we view advertisements as providing information to a consumer.
We do not deliver pop-up, pop-under or other separate-window advertisements.
==========
Please also know that Dotomi will not send the consumer any more advertisements than they already receive today.
We simply just replace the ads they receive today with ones that are more relevant to them.
How does Dotomi provide the consumer relevant ads?
How does Dotomi find consumers on the web?
What is a “Cookie” or “Pixel Tag”?

Disclosure of Information
Why Dotomi Inc.?
Changes to This Privacy Policy
How does Dotomi provide the consumer relevant ads?
We partner with Marketing companies (“Marketing Partners”) whose Privacy Policy allows them to share information about their customers and/or inquirers as well as information about a consumers interests and/or purchase behavior with the Marketing Partner.
All Personally Identifiable Information is rendered anonymous for our services.
We will not and do not accept any credit card numbers or Social Security numbers from any Marketing Partner.
The combined Marketing Partner information provided allows us to analyze and understand more about the things consumers are or might be interested in, allowing Dotomi to replace advertisements with ones more relevant to the consumer.

How does Dotomi find consumers on the web?
==========
When a consumer visits one of our Marketing Partner’s websites or sometimes when an e-mail is sent to a consumer, a “cookie” or “pixel tag” may placed on the consumer’s machine.
No Personally Identifiable Information is transferred in the Dotomi cookie or pixel tag.
Dotomi only knows the consumer by an anonymous ID, so that we can replace non-relevant ads with ads that are more relevant to the consumer’s interests.
Again, we don’t know who the consumer is, we just know the consumer’s preferences through that ID.

What is a “Cookie” or “Pixel Tag”?
A cookie is an industry standard small data file placed on a consumer’s computer.
Cookies allow marketers to “remember you” when you return to their website.
Again, no Personally Identifiable Information is transferred in the Dotomi cookie.
==========
Consumers have the capability of deleting cookies on their machine, however, if they enjoy the convenience of a website “remembering them”, consumers are advised not to delete their cookies.
A pixel tag is an industry standard often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed in a website or e-mail.
Again, no Personally Identifiable Information is transferred in this pixel tag.
This allows a marketer to understand what products or services a consumer - as a “user” - may be interested in based on their actions on a Marketing Partner’s website or within an e-mail.
Dotomi cookies and pixel tags do not track the consumer outside of the Marketing Partners website or e-mail.

Disclosure of Information
We may disclose the anonymous information to our Marketing Partners and other third parties for advertising, marketing and analytical purposes.
==========
Dotomi may also need to disclose information from our third-party partner if (1) we believe that there has been a violation of the law, of your rights, or of our rights (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; and (3) if our company or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.

Why Dotomi Inc.?
Why not?
==========
As you surf the internet, you will receive ads.
Wouldn’t you rather receive ads that are more relevant to you?
Remember, you will receive no increase in the number of ads you receive in a given day.
==========
The Dotomi difference is that you will receive more relevant ads.
If you prefer not to receive relevant advertising from Dotomi, please click on the following link to opt-out.
Please allow up to 10 days for this change to take place.
If you have any additional questions or suggestions regarding the program, please e-mail us at This e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view it .
