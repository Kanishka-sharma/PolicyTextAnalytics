As the powerhouse of the WhatRocks™ label, WhatRocks Inc. (“WhatRocks”, “we”, or “us”) operates on behalf and in the name of the WhatRocks Foundation, the overarching non-profit organization that oversees the WhatRocks™ label to build a global community of engaged, purpose-driven individuals, corporations (including but not limited to advertisers, publishers, and event organizers), charitable non-profit organizations and social enterprises (each a “Charity”) that take action together to fund social change :
1 - Brands reward users financially with blockchain tokens called Rocks™ when they engage or interact with WhatRocks™-labeled marketing or advertising material across the web such as online banner ads, video or rich media ads, emails, websites and mobile apps.
2 - Users redeem their Rocks™ to make direct donations to the Charity of their choice or to purchase goods and services such as tickets and promo codes to local events and parties (“Content”) from Members of the WhatRocks™ community (see below) that will donate the Rocks™ they have received as payment to the Charity of their own choice.
3 – Charities fund their activities by selling their Rocks™ for cash to brands that need to reward users financially when they engage with their own WhatRocks™-labeled marketing or advertising material.
The mission of WhatRocks is to bring to life the vision of the WhatRocks Foundation that individuals everywhere be financially empowered by the marketing and advertising spend of advertisers, so they have the money to make donations to the social and environmental causes they care about.
To that purpose, WhatRocks has developed a proprietary technology-based ecosystem (“Service”) that includes a technical platform and a suite of tools and products described below to support the development and the management of the WhatRocks™ community of the WhatRocks Foundation, the delivery of WhatRocks™-labeled marketing or advertising material to Members of the WhatRocks™ community as well as the processing of transactions such as financial rewards, donations and payments.
As WhatRocks is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy, we have developed this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") that applies when anyone uses our Service to help make sure they understand what information WhatRocks collects, what we do with the information we collect, store, process and share and the choices they can make to control their privacy when they use our Service or to correct or change such information (individually and collectively, "you", “they”).
More specifically, when you register to become a Member of the WhatRocks™ community to use the Service, the data and information that you provide or that is generated or inferred directly or indirectly, actively or passively from your use of the Service is collected, stored, processed and used by WhatRocks on behalf and in the name of the WhatRocks Foundation.

==========
As brands and individuals that are Members of the WhatRocks™ community collectively redefine the marketing and advertising value exchange in a way that establishes a new social contract, the core principles of the WhatRocks Foundation are that (1) brands pay a personal data dividend (“Dividend”, “Rewards”) in Rocks™ to individuals when they engage or interact with their WhatRocks™-labeled marketing or advertising material in respect of the commercial use of the collected personal data that remains the individuals’ fully owned assets, (2) the Dividend paid by brands goes up as individuals agree to share more personal data with brands, (3) the Dividend paid to individuals is used solely for them to make donations to Charities or purchase Content from Members who will in turn make donations to Charities, and (4) account opening is free of charge and transactions are commission-free to keep donations untouched and allow anyone to join the WhatRocks™ community (please note that some business and technology partners of WhatRocks may charge some fees such as banking, operation and maintenance fees that are not earned directly or indirectly by WhatRocks or the WhatRocks Foundation).
As WhatRocks™ is entrusted with the mission to implement the vision and enforce the principles of the WhatRocks Foundation, we need to know a little about you and your interests to provide and run our Service and show you relevant Content and information.

==========
We do this currently through a third-party service.
That third-party service may store some of the information as part of their provision of services to us.
If you do not use Facebook or another social networking site (SNS) to log in then that third-party does not receive any data.
==========
If you are already logged into the Service and Facebook or another SNS, when you click on "Connect with Facebook," or a similar connection on another SNS, you will be prompted to merge your profiles.

==========
Passive Gathering of Information Electronically
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are part of the fabric of the Internet, and are assigned to a device whenever that device connects online.
When a website needs to send something to your computer (for instance search results), it needs your IP address to send it to the right device.
IP Address from which your device accesses the Service may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you use our Service, along with the time of your visit and the specific page(s) that you visited.
Your IP address.
Your “IP Address” is a designator that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
We use IP service Google Places API to suggest your location from real-time signals like your IP address or device location and we also use past activity on the Service to help us understand the city or country you are using our Service from and show you relevant Charities to donate to as well as Content that may be of interest in your geographic area.

Collecting this information helps us build and deliver the best possible version of the Service to you.
==========
As part of our efforts to connect people to causes that interest them, donations you make or fundraisers you start or participate in might be tagged by you, by our Members or by us as particular cause areas.
For example, a Charity may be tagged as “animal rights” or “poverty alleviation”.
If you make a donation for a particular cause area, we may infer that you would be interested in other Charities or fundraisers tagged in the same way.
We may also show you Charities or fundraisers that are relevant to your interest or in your general geographic area.

A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web or application session and expire when you close your browser or exit the application.
==========
Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Service and will last for longer.
Some of the cookies used by the Service are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.
We, and/or our service providers may use cookies, and other similar technologies to understand Member activities.
Like other services, WhatRocks will not function properly if cookies are not enabled.
==========
We may use third-party analytics services on our Service like Google Analytics provided by Google Inc. (“Google”).
These service providers use cookies and other technologies to help us analyze how Members use the Service, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you.
The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Service.
==========
This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Service.
This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Service when you visit other websites.
To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
These analytics services may use cookies and similar technologies to analyze how people use our Service and provide statistical reports about aggregate Member behaviour.
Such services may also collect information about the use of other websites.
Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser’s settings to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set.
==========
Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used by WhatRocks, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Service.
In particular, we will not be able to inform advertisers that you should be paid a Dividend because you have engaged with their WhatRocks™-labeled marketing or advertising material.
Giving your consent to the use of cookies is required to use the Service.
==========
Please review our Cookies Policy for detailed information on the cookies we use, and how you can manage these.
Information collected through cookies as disclosed in our linked Cookies Policy
Web beacons (also known as clear GIFs) are transparent image files.
Web beacons enable WhatRocks to track usage information on our Service, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed.
Web beacons are invisible to you and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your device.
We may use them in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of the Service.
We may also use Web beacons to track whether you have opened an HTML email.
When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon that then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed.
Web Beacons may also recognize when the email was opened, how many times it was forwarded and which URL’s (links within the email) were clicked.
Giving your consent to the use of web beacons is required to use the Service.
Information collected through web beacons as disclosed in our linked Cookies Policy
In addition, we use pixel tags (also referred to as clear Gifs, web beacons, or web bugs).
Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.
==========
Pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our Members.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a Member and we may tie the information gathered by pixel tags to information that is intended to identify our Members.
Giving your consent to the use of pixel tags is required to use the Service.
Information collected through pixel tags as disclosed in our linked Cookies Policy
Aggregated and De-Identified Information
From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us information that is not intended to allow us to identify you personally.
This information may be aggregated and/or de-identified and used for our internal purposes or for creating reports for third-party advertisers and partners, or otherwise shared with third parties for any lawful purpose, without your permission.
==========
We also may automatically collect usage information in connexion with our Service, such as the numbers and frequency of Members’ visits to the Service, pages visited and similar data.
This data is used in the aggregate and/or is de-identified, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that is intended to identify you personally.
Aggregate and de-identified information generally is collected through the use of cookies and web beacons as discussed above, but we may also aggregate or de-identify data that you provide to us.
This aggregate and/or de-identified information helps WhatRocks determine general usage patterns and modify the Service in order to improve your experience.
This type of aggregate information may be shared with third parties at any time.
==========
Information from Third Parties and other Members
We may receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their contacts or calendar with our Service, associate their contacts with Member profiles, or send messages using our Service (including invitations to go to an event or to participate in a fundraiser).
If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Service, we will also collect information that we can associate with Member profiles.
It may be necessary for us to obtain address or other information about you from third-party sources for fraud prevention or for legal compliance, to enforce our legal rights or to protect the rights of other Members of the WhatRocks™ community.
Information Collected from Charities
If you are a Charity and you register to the WhatRocks™ community by establishing an account with WhatRocks, we, and/or our service providers will collect the name, business number, tax ID, physical address, email address, birthday and phone number of the person who establishes a Charity account and claims your Charity (the "Charity Contact") and any other information that is required by the applicable KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundry) regulations.

Information Collected from corporations
If you are a corporation and you register to the WhatRocks™ community by establishing an account with WhatRocks, we, and/or our service providers will collect the name, business number, physical address, email address, birthday and phone number of the person who establishes a corporate account and claims your corporation (the "Corporate Contact") and any other information that is required by the applicable KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundry) regulations.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to your request.

==========
