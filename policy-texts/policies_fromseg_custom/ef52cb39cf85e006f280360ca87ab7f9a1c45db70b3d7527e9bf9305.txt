Hot linking:
 "Hot linking" refers to the practice of inserting a link in a piece of HTML to an image on another server.
==========
Due to a recent rash of people using hot linking to our copyrighted images in numerous ways, such as on their own web pages, in articles, on commercial sites, and in ebay auctions, we have had to put a technical block on the serving of images from the Web Site.
Images can now only be seen where they were intended, on pages within this Web Site.
Hot linking takes server time, control, copyright and bandwidth away from the real users of this Web Site and we will not allow it.
If you would like to use an image from the Web Site please contact us first and ask permission.
