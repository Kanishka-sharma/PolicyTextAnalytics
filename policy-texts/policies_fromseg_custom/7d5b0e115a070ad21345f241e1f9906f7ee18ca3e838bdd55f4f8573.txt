==========
THE COMPANY PLATFORM
Company operates several platforms and services that comprise our “Services.”
These include the Unruly Platform, Tremor Video DSP, Unruly DMP and RhythmOne Platform.
==========
As further described below, through our Services we work with websites, web services, content publishers, mobile applications, and various platforms that provide services for those types of organizations, in particular to help them display ads on their properties and to subsidize the cost of their content – often, allowing them to provide consumers with some or all of their content for free.
We also work with advertisers (and their service providers) – brands, retailers, entertainment companies, non-profits and others – to help them advertise in a way that is efficient and relevant to both them and the consumer.
We use data in a variety of ways to help support these businesses, and likewise provide a variety of ways for consumers to control how data is used to market to them.
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain what that data is, how it is used, and what those choices are.
2.
==========
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE IN PROVIDING OUR SERVICES
We are able to help advertisers as well as publishers provide more relevant content and targeted advertising by collecting certain information about you, including when you interact with our Services.
This may include your interactions with (a) marketers, their websites, apps, advertisements and other content (collectively “Marketers”), or (b) publishers, app developers and other CTV, web and mobile services (collectively “Publishers”).
In this Privacy Policy, when we use the term “Customers” we are referring to both Marketers and Publishers.
Sometimes we work with other marketing, service providers or data platforms who provide services to us as well as Customers:  we refer to these companies as “Partners.”
==========
We (or our Customers or these Partners) may provide relevant content and targeted advertising to consumers by using automated technologies such as cookies, including non-HTTP cookies, pixel tags, mobile identifiers and SDKs, each of which we describe below, and in Section 3 titled, “Cookies, Pixel Tags, SDKs and Similar Technologies.”
These technologies often generate or collect unique identifiers, such as cookie IDs or mobile advertising IDs.
We describe below these and other categories of information that we receive from consumers operating systems, browsers and devices, as well as from Customers, Partners, advertising platforms and networks, and data resellers.
(Some companies may fit into more than one such category.)
We have tried to describe the information in a way that is easy to understand:
a.    Identifiers collected from website and app sources
whether directly or through other content and information platforms, including:
Online cookie IDs
Mobile advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFAs, Ad IDs) and other mobile device or browser identifiers
IP addresses
Identifiers related to other devices, such as connected TVs
We refer to all of the above as “IDs“
b.    Online usage information or “log” information
Generally related to the above IDs
Data related to or describing a web browser, operating system, and device, such as the name and version of your browser
connection data, including (as described above) current IP address, from which location may be inferred
online usage data including websites visited, websites visited prior to a web visit, date/time stamp
Information related to interactions with ads and marketing, such as consumer engagement with an ad
Information related to interactions with websites, such as whether a consumer was “referred” through another website or a shared link.
==========
We may link any of the above to our own or our Partners’ and Customers’ IDs.
We receive the above information from Customers and Partners, advertising platforms and networks, and data resellers.
==========
(Some companies fit into more than one of those categories.)
c.    Demographic and Interest-Based Information
We may collect, use, or create “audience segments” (also referred to as “data segments), which are generally used to tailor advertising and marketing to consumers and to analyze consumer interaction with such ads.
Audience segments are interest-based or demographic-based groupings of large numbers of users, generally in aggregated form, tied to the above IDs.
==========
For instance, an inference that Ad ID X35%979J is interested is “Sports” might be drawn from the fact that the browser often views sports-related content.
Or, an inference that Cookie ID 4Qj7e9!
x may be interested in a new car may be drawn from the corresponding browsers frequent search of new automobile reviews.
==========
(Actual IDs are generally much longer strings of code; the above are simply used for illustration.)
Sometimes these inferences are made from “offline data” that is coded and linked to cookies and IDs (and further linked to our own cookies and IDs) by Partners that create “hashed” (coded) values to replace “real-world” identifiers such as email addresses.
Sometimes these inferences are made from demographic information (“protected classifications” for purposes of the California CCPA), such as gender or age, or inferred income level.
==========
Sometimes, these audience segments are associated with the likelihood to have a particular health condition.
A list of our standard health segments is here.
(We endeavor to update the list frequently, but the list may not be current to the precise date.)
==========
In addition, we may sometimes create “custom” health-related segments, or work with advertisers or partners who use such segments.
Those “custom” segments change over time, but a representative sample is included.
==========
Note that such information is only collected/processed at an aggregate level and solely in the U.S. and Canada.
d.    Transactional information from our Customers
Our Customers may provide us with their own proprietary or licensed information, including “audience segments” described above, to help us better perform or deliver our Services.
e.    Geolocation Information
The mobile information we collect or receive from our Partners and Customers also may include geolocation information, which may be precise, that may help us or our Customers to target ads or tailor content to your precise location.
==========
For instance, if we believe that you are often near a particular store in Northern New Jersey, we might send you an ad targeted to that store, rather than another store in the general area.
f.    Further Description of Technologies
For additional explanation of the technologies through which IDs and other data are collected, please see Section 3 further below regarding cookies, pixel tags and SDKs.
We may use cookies, pixel tags, SDKs and similar technologies to collect the above information, or to associate certain types of information with each other.
3.
COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS, SDKS AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
The Company (along with our Partners and Customers) uses a variety of technology to collection information.
==========
These are listed and described below.
a.    Pixels
A tracking “pixel” is a transparent graphic image (usually a 1 x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and allows for the collection of information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel.
==========
Company collects technical and usage information through the use of tracking pixels.
b.    Cookies
A “cookie” is a string of stored code used by a website to send some data to a user’s device.
Depending on the settings of the device or web browser this data may be stored on the user’s device so that the device can later return that data to the same website.
==========
Cookies can be used with online services, such as websites, email deliveries or advertising technologies, to recognize an Internet or mobile-connected device that they have encountered before.
We use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, track user trends, and collect information about how you use our Customer’s sites or interact with the advertising we (or others) deliver on their behalf.
We likewise use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.
We also use cookies when you visit our corporate website.
==========
c.      Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We also sometimes use, or partner with Publishers or Publisher-facing and app developer platforms that use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services.
A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon (see “Pixels,” above).
The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
We may use this technology to deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.
If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the “Your Choices” section below.
==========
d.      Third Party Suppliers and Vendors
The Company works with third party technology or service providers that provide us with hosting, serving, general campaign or site analytics, ad serving data, or demographic and other audience data about the use and viewership of our Customers’ advertising, or websites that display that advertising on Publishers we work with.
Such third-party providers may utilize pixels, cookies, flash cookies, web beacons and/or similar technologies that may be activated when Our Customers advertisement is encountered on a Publisher.
In all instances where the use, collection and disclosure of information is by one of these third-party providers, their privacy policies shall govern and this Privacy Policy does not apply.
==========
e.      Disabling Cookies
Most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies.
You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies.
However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our Services may be difficult to use or inoperable.
In addition, we may use (or work with certain third-party companies that use) techniques other than or in addition to HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services.
These technologies may rely on the collection and analysis of “non-cookie” information from your browser or device, such as, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, resolution and other data, for purposes of creating a unique profile or “fingerprint” of your browser or device.
We (or other third parties) may use this profile to understand and analyze how you interact with the Services, to customize content or advertising to you through the Services, to monitor against fraud or misuse of the Services, or in other ways consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.

==========
THE BUSINESS PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE AND SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
a.
Our Purposes Generally
Principally, we use the information described in Section 2 to operate, provide, develop and improve our Services.
==========
This involves facilitating various types of advertising and marketing to make them more effective, more relevant, and (we believe) more likely to engage and interest (and less likely to annoy) consumers.
b.    Personalized Advertising
This includes facilitating and providing behavioral advertising, i.e., tailoring advertising and content using the types of “audience segments” or “data segments” (and other, related types of information) we describe in Section 2.
As we also describe in Section 2, these audience segments may be based on your activity across multiple websites or mobile apps over time, on your transactions, on your location, or on coded or “hashed” data derived from offline demographic and interest data.
Generally, the tailoring of ads to devices and browsers (and sometimes through other channels) based on this type of data is called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising.
(Please go to Section 6 to learn about what choices you have, in control how you are marketed to in this way.)
c.
==========
Other Advertising and Analytics Purposes
We also use the information to analyze, measure the effectiveness of, frequency-cap or sequence advertising.
For instance, we may use the information we collect to compare how many “clicks” the recipients of one ad campaign receives vs. a different ad campaign.
Or, we may track which users have seen which ads, to avoid a user being shown the same ad repeatedly.
d.    Syncing Identifiers
We sometimes integrate our information with Partners, to allow advertisers to access our information across other platforms (and their information across our platform), in order to allow advertisers to reach more consumers across various channels.
This may include online, offline, social media or television advertising.
e.    Identity Graphing
We may also create or help our Customers or Partners to create “identity” graphs, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, email address).
f.
Other Business Purposes
We also may also use the information we collect for internal research, internal operations, auditing, detecting and preventing security incidents, anti-fraud purposes, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance.
5.

This section of the Privacy Policy is intended solely for and is applicable only to California Consumers:  if you are not a California Consumer (or a resident of California), this does not apply to you and you should not rely on it.
a.
The right to access and disclosure
You may have the right to request, twice during a twelve-month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:

You may have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
We need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you, and may retain certain information for important business purposes, such as fulfilling our legal obligations, or for security, auditing or de-bugging purposes.
c.
==========
How to exercise your access and deletion rights
California residents may exercise their California access or deletion rights by accessing our Do Not Sell link or, by sending an email to privacy@tremorinternational.com.
For security purposes, we will verify your identity – in part by requesting or automatically capturing certain information from you — when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.
==========
For instance, you may need to provide your email address.
To request that we provide you with the specific pieces of personal information we have from you or to delete personal information we have collected from you, we may also need to ask you for additional information to verify your identity.
Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate:
Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide the information you have requested, except where not permitted under applicable law or otherwise exempted by the CCPA.
