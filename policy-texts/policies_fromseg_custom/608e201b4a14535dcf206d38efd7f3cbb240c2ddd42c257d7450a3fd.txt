Privacy across the SAP network 
As a global company, SAP operates a number of Web sites around the world.
Any information that you submit to one of our sites in any one country or language may be sent electronically to a server for one of these sites in another country.
As such, the information may be used, stored, or processed outside the country where it was recorded.
However, we safeguard your data-security interests around the world by ensuring that this SAP site adheres to our international privacy principles described in this policy.
==========
What information do we collect and why?
IP addresses
We may use your IP address (not your e-mail address) to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, or to gather broad demographic information.
==========
Cookies
We may use cookies to enhance the user experience and deliver personalized content.
Cookies help us to deliver information specific to your interests, to save you having to re-enter your password each time you visit our site, or to keep track of your shopping cart.
Cookies also allow us to better analyze our site traffic patterns so that we can bolster our Web offering.
==========

Advertising networks that serve ads onto our web site may also use their own cookies.

For the use of e-mail addresses in connection with e-mail based services, please see the paragraph "Registration for third party services at mySAP.com" below.
Registration for third party services at mySAP.com
At mySAP.com you can register for third party services.
Those services are available through mySAP.com, but are provided by a third party, which is typically not affiliated with SAP.
When you sign up for one of these services, it may be necessary to transfer some of your mySAP.com registration information to this service provider.
==========
Also, if the service you chose requires your e-mail address to fulfill this service, we will also give your e-mail address to the service provider.
This means we will pass your e-mail address to a service provider ONLY in the event that you specifically asked for this service and the service cannot be provided without your e-mail address.
For privacy practices and opt-out procedures of those service providers, please refer to the individual privacy policy of the respective service provider.
==========
"Send this to a friend" service
You can choose to forward information, a web page or link to someone else using our e-mail service "Send this to a friend".
In order to do that you provide us with your e-mail address, as well as that of the recipient.
This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the e-mail.
==========
The information is not used for any other purpose.
Shopping
Our site includes order forms that you fill out to request information, products, and services.
==========
These forms collect your financial information, such as your banking details or credit card.
We will use any financial information that you submit solely for billing and payment purposes.
==========
Online surveys
From time to time, we may conduct online surveys.
Our surveys may ask you for demographic information, such as zip codes or your industry sector.

SAP is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites.

Online Security
SAP wants your shopping experience to be simple and safe.
We support secure online shopping using secure server technology.
The secure server technology used on SAP Store encrypts your personal financial information before it is transmitted over the Internet.
That means information such as your name and credit card number is protected in a secret code until we receive them.
This technology works best when the store site is viewed using any browser that supports secure server technology.
If you select the option during your initial registration with the SAP Store to allow us to store and remember your credit card and related billing information for future purchases, your credit card and passwords are stored in an encrypted format.
