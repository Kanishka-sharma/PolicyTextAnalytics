After your initial visit to the Site and Services we may change the cookies and other technologies we use.
Use of IP addresses and web logs
We may also use your IP address and browser type to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site and to improve the service we offer to you.
An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on the internet.
Your IP address might also be used to gather broad demographic information.
==========
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting.
New Relic does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
New Relic takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.
