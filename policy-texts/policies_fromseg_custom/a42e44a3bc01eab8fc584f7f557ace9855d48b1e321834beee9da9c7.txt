What we do
Captify is a specialist in displaying advertisements that are relevant to you.
Our aim is to enhance your online advertising experience by showing you personalised adverts for products we think you might like, based on your recent browsing history.
In practice, you search for a product online, explore your various options and continue to surf the web.
