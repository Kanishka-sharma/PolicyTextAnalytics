How Does It Work?
Simply put, BlueKai is building a database of intentions by tagging intent behaviors across the Internet.
Data providers submit information into the exchange using BlueKai's tagging technology.
==========
We then classify the data based on purchase intent categories such as travel, auto, retail shopping, and so on.
When a buyer bids for and wins access to the data that you've provided, you receive a check for the revenue share on the payment.
==========
Data collection for the BlueKai Exchange is supported by the User Experience Guard (UXG), a state of the art security and latency management system that ensures a seamless experience for your site users.
UXG safeguards your site experience by constantly monitoring and isolating 3rd party pixels in order to accurately and efficiently process data collection into the exchange while providing real-time response mechanisms to non-responsive pixel activity.
