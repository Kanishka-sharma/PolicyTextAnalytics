web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed
to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices

Traffic Data Each time a visitor comes to a WorldNetDaily.com site, our servers collect
some basic technical information, including the visitor's domain name (e.g.,
whether the user is logged on to the internet from aol.com or
whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the URL a user
visited prior to clicking through to a WorldNetDaily.com site) and browser
and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).
We also track the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic
flows at our sites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, and how traffic
flows within the WorldNetDaily.com sites, etc.) We may merge information
about visitors and visits into group data, which may be shared on an
aggregate basis with our advertisers.
However, we will not disclose your individual identity or personally
identifiable data to any party.
When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will
be able to identify you or contact you.
WorldNetDaily.com and cookies A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a
server and stored on your computer's hard drive.
==========
We use cookies in a very
limited manner, primarily to help deliver advertisements so that you won't
receive the same advertisement too many times.
We use cookies to identify
unique browsers that visit us and to track site navigation.
We also use
cookies on our shopping site to make the ordering process more convenient
for visitors.
Cookies are used with our online polls to insure accurate
results by allowing only one vote per computer on the current questions.
Other sites that place advertisements on our site, or which we may provide
a link referencing an article that is available to view on
WorldNetDaily.com, also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a
process that WorldNetDaily.com does not control.
Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines.
So these
advertisers will not know who a visitor is, nor  will they have any
personally identifiable information about a visitor.
==========

Promotions From time to time, WorldNetDaily.com may sponsor contests or other events
that require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact
and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be
used for the event.
WorldNetDaily.com may also co-sponsor these events along
with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and
demographic information is likely to be shared with these other
participating sponsors.
A registrant's personal contact and demographic
information will not be disclosed to third-party or non-participating
organizations without the user's prior consent, and WorldNetDaily.com will
request that co-sponsors of such events uphold the privacy of the registrant's information.
