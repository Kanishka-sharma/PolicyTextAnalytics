As further discussed below, we collect Personal Data to offer advertising services that we have a legitimate interest to believe are of interest to our customers and/or that you have requested, to manage the relationship we have with our customers, and to perform other activities based on your consent where required by law.

The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media network.
==========
Data Obtained by Automated Means
We also obtain certain data by automated means, though the use of cookies (including HTTP and HTML5 local storage), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your usage of various Company affiliate sites and mobile applications, and other offerings and services.
A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a user’s computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the user’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
==========
The data the Company obtains and receives from users of its affiliates’ sites and applications through these automated collection methods may include:
IP address
Mobile device advertising ID
Browser characteristics
Device characteristics
Operating system
Language preferences
Referring URLs
Information on actions taken on Company affiliate sites
Dates and times users access or use Company affiliate sites
Cookies set on Company affiliate sites for syncing purposes as described below.
We may link this data, such as browser or device information, with other data obtained by automated means, including what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on Company affiliate sites and the advertisements placed by NewsIQ on whitelisted non-Company sites.
==========
You can learn more and control Flash Cookies by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Panel and Global Storage Settings Panel.
Please note, however, that without cookies some or all of the features of the Company affiliate services may not be available to you.
User device settings also may limit mobile application platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain data obtained by automated means with us through our Company affiliate mobile applications.
News IQ ID & ID Syncing
NCAE associates data it collects about a browser or device with a number of randomly generated identifiers in the form of cookies – the name of each of these cookies is prefixed by the letters “_ncg_”.
To the extent permitted by your browser settings, NCAE will synchronize the values of one or more of these cookies in such a way that it will allow NCAE to use a singular browser identifier across the participating Company affiliate sites you or the specific browser or device have visited.
Through this singular identifier, NCAE will sync the data obtained from these sites and/or mobile applications to serve you advertisements on our Company affiliate sites and apps, as well as on whitelisted non-Company sites, tailored to your interests, as further described in the Interest-Based Advertising Section below.
ID syncing, also known as cookie syncing or cookie matching, is a common industry practice that enables businesses to use data to coordinate an advertising campaign across multiple publishing platforms and advertising service providers.
==========
As an example, an individual uses a web browser to visit a publisher’s website and then leaves the website.
The publisher wants to advertise relevant services to that visitor after he/she leaves the website.
To do so, the publisher stores a cookie on the visitor’s browser with an ID (such as “123”) and associates the ID with information about what the visitor viewed on the publisher’s website, and buys advertising through an online advertising exchange or marketplace.
In order to buy appropriate advertising to display to that visitor, the publisher would need to match the “123” ID with the ID that the exchange has assigned to the same visitor (for example, exchange ID “XYZ”).
Using ID syncing, the publisher “123” ID is associated with the same browser or device as the exchange ID “XYZ”.
In addition, the publisher may be able to show more relevant advertisements to the visitor based on the initial information the publisher collected from that visitor when the visitor was on the publisher’s site.
==========
For example, the syncing allows the publisher to match the data collected from the visitor while on the publisher’s site with other sources of data also associated with the visitor.
This syncing can be done across multiple sites.
==========
The Purposes & Legal Bases for Which We Use the Data We Obtain
We use the data collected from and about you, and rely on legitimate interest to use the data, to:
Supplement Personal Data collected by the Company and our affiliates with additional data from publicly and commercially available sources, and make inferences regarding your preferences and further supplement your profile with such inferred preferences to provide relevant content and advertising;
Display targeted advertising on Company affiliate sites and whitelisted non-Company sites;

Associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use for the purpose of providing relevant and easier access to content, advertising across browsers and devices, and other operational/business purposes (please also see the Interest-Based Advertising Section below for more details);
