PANDORA TERMS OF USE
To make it a bit easier to digest our Terms of Use, we thought we'd start by highlighting in plain English some of the issues.
This summary is not a legal document.
Of course you'll want to read the complete Terms of Use, but here's what we think is important:
Terms:

Due to the way our music licensing works, you have to live in the United States to use Pandora® internet radio.
You also have to be at least 13 years old.
Pandora can only be used if you are in the United States.
==========
You are responsible for keeping your account password private.
Pandora is for personal use only, that means you can't play Pandora for the patrons in your bar, coffee shop, etc.
You can't use Pandora to steal music, and you have to listen to it through pandora.com or on a device officially supported by Pandora.
==========
Do not use Pandora if you do not agree to the Terms of Use.
Your use of Pandora means you agree to the Terms of Use.
