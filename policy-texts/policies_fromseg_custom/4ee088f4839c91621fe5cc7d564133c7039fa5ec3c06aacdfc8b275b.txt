Session Cookies allow a website to link a series of your actions during one browser session, for example, to remember the items you have added to a shopping basket.

Session Cookies expire after a browser session and are therefore not stored on your computer or device afterward.
Persistent Cookies are stored on your computer or device between browser sessions and can be used when you make subsequent visits to the website, for example, to remember your website preferences, such as language or font size.
