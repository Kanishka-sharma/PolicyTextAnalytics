Some explanations about cookies:

pvc3, pcc3, trc, ad2, view, landing – different types of conversions(action) tracking cookies, all of them have impression context string
tuuid – P161’s user ID
tuuid_lu (last update) – timestamp of last update of user’s cookie

Next to the data that are being gathered by Platform161 through dropping our own cookies, third party data can also be used to optimize our campaigns.
These third party data come from third party data providers that live up to current law and industry standards.Platform161’s cookies will be stored for 13 months after being dropped on a device.
==========
* Ad tags.
Platform161’s technology responds to requests from ‘ad tags’ placed on the website you are visiting.
Ad tags provide Platform161 with information and enable Platform161 to determine the correct size and location of an ad.
==========
* Pixel tags.
Platform161 also uses pixel tags (also known as javascript or 1×1 pixels) to drop cookies.
A pixel tag is a tiny graphic or script placed on a website that is not visible to the user.
These pixel tags communicate with the technology of Platform161 and enable Platform161 to recognize a user by means of its UUID, or in the event that no UUID has been assigned to a user, to drop a cookie on the user’s equipment and assign a UUID to the user.
The use of pixel tags allows Platform161 to measure campaign effectiveness, to optimize campaign performance and to provide more relevant advertising.
Pixel tags furthermore allow Platform161 to create and identify consumer segments and to select the appropriate ad based on the consumer segment.
==========

Platform161’s Technology
Data Controller, Data Collected, Purpose
Besides the data collected when a cookie is dropped, the Platform161 technology also collects the following possible personal data: such as the date and time of ad delivery to a user, the IP-address, postal code, region and country of a user, language setting, the type of browser, operating system used and connection speed, status of a user (unknown, accepting or not accepting cookies), the web page address(es) where the ad has been delivered, and administered clicks on ads.
This information helps our technology to decide the best and most relevant ad to display to a user.
Platform161’s technology collects and stores aggregated ad delivery reporting data.
This data is used to provide our clients with campaign reporting and used for billing purposes.
A typical report includes information about the ads delivered, including the date and time of ad delivery, the websites on which the ads were shown, and statistics on user response.
A report also includes statistics about browser types, date and time of ad delivery, and inferred geography.
Finally, the information collected (by means of cookies and/or other tracking methods) is processed for internal purposes only: i.e. to possibly build user profiles that enable Platform161 to optimize and personalize advertiser campaigns.

Processing of personal data for HR purposes
We process the applicant’s data only for the purpose and in the context of the application procedure in accordance with the legal requirements.
The processing of the applicant’s data takes place in order to fulfil our (pre-)contractual obligations in the context of the application procedure within the meaning of Art. 6 I b GDPR and Art. 6 I b GDPR if data processing becomes necessary for us, e.g. within the framework of legal procedures.
The application procedure requires that applicants provide us with their data.
If we offer an online form, the necessary applicant data are marked and do otherwise result from the job descriptions and generally include personal data, postal and contact addresses and the documents belonging to the application, such as cover letter, curriculum vitae and certificates.
In addition, applicants may voluntarily provide us with additional information.
==========
By submitting the application to us, applicants agree to the processing of their data for the purposes of the application procedure in accordance with the type and scope set out in this data privacy declaration.
Insofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 I GDPR are voluntarily communicated within the scope of the application procedure, they are additionally processed in accordance with Art. 9 I b GDPR (e.g. health data, severely disabled status or ethnic origin).
If special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 I GDPR are requested from applicants during the application procedure, they are additionally processed in accordance with Art. 9 II a GDPR (e.g. health data, if these are required for the exercise of the profession).
==========
An applicant can decide to send us their applications by e-mail.
Please note however, that e-mails are generally not sent in encrypted form and that the applicants themselves must ensure that they are encrypted.
==========
We cannot therefore accept any responsibility for the transmission of the application between the sender and receipt on our server and therefore recommend that you use an online form or the postal dispatch.
Instead of using the online application form and e-mail, applicants can still send us their application by post.
If the application is successful, the data provided by the applicant can be further processed by us for the purpose of employment.
Otherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicant’s data will be deleted.
Applicants’ data will also be deleted if an application is withdrawn, which the applicants are entitled to do at any time.
The deletion will take place within the applicable legally defined retention times, latest after a period of six months, subject to a justified revocation by the applicant, so that we can answer any follow-up questions to the application and meet further applicable legal obligation.
==========
Invoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses are archived in accordance with tax regulations.
Personal data processed in regard to contact forms
All personal data provided to Platform161 through the use of a contact form will be handled in accordance with the applicable legal obligations.
By using the contact form and providing information through this to Platform161, the user consents to Platform161 processing said data to comply with user requests and possible follow-ups.
