The American  Medical Association (AMA) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting  it at all times.
This online Privacy Policy explains how the AMA collects, uses  and safeguards information on its various websites and apps.
==========
We collect  information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our Web  server logs and through cookies and other technologies.
We use the information  primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers  the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to  you.
==========
We don't share any of the information you provide with others, unless we  say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good faith that the law  requires it.
You should review this Policy and our related Terms of Use.
By accessing our  websites and using our services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and to be  bound by our Terms of Use.
If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this  Privacy Policy, you should end this session now and refrain from using our  websites and apps in the future.
==========
Changes to the Privacy Policy
As our  organization, membership and benefits change from time to time, we expect this  Privacy Policy to change as well.
We reserve the right to amend the Policy at  any time, for any reason, and will signal a change by revising the "Last  updated" date at the bottom of this page.
==========
What information we collect and how we use it
Information we  collect -- When you browse our www.ama-assn.org or www.jamanetwork.com, for example, and  do not interact with the site for any online service or product from the AMA,  you browse anonymously.
Information that identifies you personally--such as  your name, address, phone number and email address--is not collected as you  browse.
When you create an  account to become a registered user on our sites, or choose to interact with us  in other ways, such as subscribing to AMA publications, purchasing an AMA  product, applying for AMA membership, participating in online surveys,  submitting questions or comments or requesting information or materials, we  will collect certain personal information from you.
The type will vary but may  include name, address, phone number, birth date, billing and delivery  information, email address, credit card information and other demographic  information.
We do not collect Social Security numbers via any AMA website.
The  product or service that you seek will determine the personal information  collected.

See what data we have about you, if any;
Change/correct any data we have about you;
Ask us to delete any data we have about you; and/or
Opt out of some or all future communications from us.
==========
When we hire  vendors to deliver emails to you on our behalf, they are under agreement and  limited from using your email address and other personal information for any  other purpose.
These email  messages may contain "clear GIFs" or "Web beacons" to  measure the offer's effectiveness so we know how to serve you better.
We do not  collect information that identifies you personally through "clear  GIFs" or "Web beacons."
You may refuse or remove the placement  of these and other cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your web  browser.
How to opt out of  email -- To opt out of future emails and newsletters, go to our AMA e-newsletter sign-up page or click the  "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email or e-newsletter from  the AMA.
==========
You also can call the AMA Unified Service Center at (800) 621-8335.
With whom we may  share information -- The AMA may share personal information (except your email  address) with our business partners in order to provide them an opportunity to  offer products or services that may be of interest to you.
==========
The AMA also  occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf  including, but not limited to, processing credit card transactions, packaging,  mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products  or services, consulting services, data modeling, session monitoring and website  analytics, printing, sending postal mail and processing membership and event  registration.
We will only provide those companies the information they need to  deliver the service.
==========
They are prohibited from using that information for any  other purpose.
Except as described in this section, third parties may not  collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over  time or across different Web sites when you use our web sites.
The AMA may  disclose your personal information to a third party if (1) reasonably necessary  to perform a service or deliver a product or publication; (2) authorized by  you; (3) permitted under this Privacy Policy; (4) required by statue or  regulation; or (5) in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:  (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the  AMA; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of AMA; (c) protect the  personal safety of AMA personnel or members of the public in urgent  circumstances; or (d) enforce the AMA's Privacy Policy or Terms of Use.
==========
In addition to  the disclosures identified above, if you are a physician or medical student,  the personal information you provide through the AMA websites may be  incorporated into the AMA's physician database commonly known as the Physician  Masterfile.
The AMA has licensed its Physician Masterfile to third parties for  more than 50 years under strict guidelines.
The names and addresses of  physicians and medical students in the AMA Physician Masterfile are made  available only for communications that are germane to the practice of medicine  or of interest to physicians or medical students as consumers.
Read further  information about the Physician  Masterfile.
==========
Tracking activity  on our website -- We track how our sites are used by both anonymous visitors and  registered users who interact with the site.
One way we track is by using  "cookies."
A cookie is a small file or string of text on the site  user's computer that is used to aid Web navigation.
Two types of cookies are  commonly used.
A session cookie is created by a website when that website is  accessed; that type of cookie is automatically deleted by closing the Web  browser.
A persistent cookie is a cookie that is stored on the hard drive of the  user's computer for a period of time chosen by the website that set the cookie,  usually for a number of years, unless the user deletes it manually.
This policy  distinguishes between short-lived cookies and long-lasting cookies.
Short-lived  cookies include all session cookies and those persistent cookies that are set  to be stored for no more than one week.
AMA-related websites may at times  require users to accept short-lived cookies in order for the websites to  function properly.
==========
Long-lasting cookies may be used on the site to track  visitor practices to help determine which site features and services are most  important and guide editorial direction.
Other long-lasting cookies may make it  possible for the user to access the site without requiring entry of a user name  or password, allow the user to view different restricted areas of the site  without reregistering, allow the user to personalize the site for future use  and provide other features and benefits.
Users who do not desire the  functionality created by the long-lasting cookie can disable the long-lasting  cookie function, either by indicating when asked that they do not wish to have  a long-lasting cookie created or by disabling the long-lasting cookie function  on their Web browser.
Individuals can opt out of long-lasting cookie functions  at any time.
We also collect unique  device identifiers and geolocation data related to devices that access the  site, for use in analyzing visitor's practices and preferences.
==========
Cookies are  required for the Members-Only and e-commerce sections of the website.
Cookies  are essential for site administration and security.
==========
Another way we track site  activity is by using transparent electronic images called "clear  GIFs," "Web bugs," or "Web beacons" on Web pages.
These images count the number of users who visit that page from specific banner  ads outside www.ama-assn.org or through email links.
==========
A similar image, sometimes  called a "spotlight tag," is used on Web pages where transactions  take place.
The spotlight tag collects numeric information, such as the dollar  amount of an online purchase, to help us understand usage of the site.
We do  not use any of these electronic images to collect personally identifiable  information.
Third party  tracking on our websites -- Online advertisements on the  AMA's websites do not collect any personal information on individual visitors.
Ad networks and data analytics firms track and analyze traffic on the AMA  sites, in part, to determine advertising effectiveness, browser types and usage  trends, and to present targeted ads based on anonymous information collected  through tracking.
This anonymous aggregate data on visitors and their use of  our content provides business intelligence to better serve visitors, improve  our content and track trends that might signal the outbreak of an infectious  disease, or contribute to improving health outcomes.
If you open an ad, you  leave our sites and become subject to the terms and practices of that separate  website, which may have different rules about tracking and data usage.
Activation of cookie blocking or Do Not Track settings in your browser, or  other mechanisms that block cookies or other tracking technologies, will not  affect the collection or use of personal information as outlined elsewhere in  this Privacy Policy.
Children under 13 -- We do not  knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age  of 13.
==========
Information  security -- The AMA implements security measures to protect against  unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of  data.
We restrict access to personal information to our employees and the AMA's  business partners who may need to know that information in order to operate,  develop or improve our services.
These individuals are bound by confidentiality  obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and  criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
How we safeguard information
Site security features
TLS technology and  how you benefit from it -- AMA realizes the importance of  security, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of  personal information sent to or from AMA over the Internet.
==========
First, we require  that a "secure session" be established, using Transport Layer  Security (TSL) technology.
This is done any time you supply or access  information in one of our secure online areas.
==========
TSL technology  creates a private conversation that only your computer and AMA systems can  understand.
The TSL technology encodes information as it is being sent over the  Internet between your computer and AMA systems, helping to ensure that the  transmitted information remains confidential.
==========
User ID and  password -- Many areas of the site require the use of a user ID and  password as an additional security measure that helps protect your information.
This allows AMA to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your  account information and preventing unauthorized access.
==========
When you have finished  using a secure area of AMA's website, make sure you always click on the  "Log Out" link which appears on every secure page.
When you click on  the "Log Out" link, you will be given the option to end your secure  session.
No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering  your user ID and password.
==========
You should be aware that browser software often  "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved  in your computer's temporary memory.
Therefore, you may find that clicking on  your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed  page.
Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or  password.
==========
No guarantee -- Unfortunately,  no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Accordingly, and despite our efforts, AMA cannot guarantee or warrant the  security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online  products or services.
==========
Email messages sent to or from a website may not be  secure.
Confidential information should not be sent by e-mail.
Site visitors  sending e-mail accept the risk that a third party may intercept e-mail  messages.
==========
Linking to other Internet sites
You should be aware  that other Internet sites that link to the AMA sites or to an AMA email may  contain privacy provisions that differ from these.
To ensure your privacy is  protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other  Internet sites you visit.
==========
How you can access and change information
If you are a  registered user of an AMA website, subscriber to AMA publications, purchaser of  AMA products or an AMA member, you may review and update or correct your  information online or by contacting the AMA Unified Service Center at (800)  621-8335.
Physicians and  medical students may update or correct  any information the AMA may have on file by going online or calling (800)  621-8335.
Updates or corrections to certain types of information (e.g.,  physician licensure, medical education or training, etc.) will require  independent verification prior to effectuating any (permanent) change to our  files.
