Ten Tips for Protecting Your Privacy Online

Look for the TRUSTe trustmark either on a Web site with a link to their privacy statement or directly on their privacy statement.
Our trustmark is your assurance that the Web site's privacy policy is backed by our multi-faceted assurance process.
Be aware that when you provide your name and/or messages to others online 
    (through bulletin boards, chat groups, etc.) they'll likely be able to find 
    out how to communicate with you-whether you want them to or not.
Read the privacy policy of individual Web sites.
If the site you
    visit doesn't have a privacy policy, ask them to post an easy-to-locate,
    clear privacy policy.
Pay attention to what information 
    they gather, how they use it, and who they share it with.
Check whether the site has an "opt-out" policy, which allows you to prevent 
    further solicitation or sharing of personal information with third parties.
Guard your password-change it often and never offer it to anyone who asks for it 
    online.
Instruct your children never to give out their name or other personal information 
    online without your permission.
Look for the closed-lock or unbroken-key icons on your browser when
performing credit card or other sensitive data entry.
If you don't see
the unbroken-key () or closed padlock
 (), OR if you see the broken key 
() or the open padlock 
() your transaction is not being securely
transmitted across the Internet.
==========
When you send messages insecurely,
someone other than the organization that you intend to send your information 
to could intercept it.
Consider requesting that the company use
a secure connection, or consider placing your order using a different
method, such as the phone, fax, or postal mail.
Check a computer reseller for software tools (e.g., anonymizers, cookie cutters) 
    that provide a layer of additional privacy protection online.
Report privacy violations and misuse of trustmarks to TRUSTe (see 
    Watchdog), or to the specific online 
    authority if the site is not a TRUSTe participant.
==========
Most important, use common sense and be aware.
You wouldn't give personal 
    information to just anyone in the offline world . . . you should apply the same 
    discretion online.
