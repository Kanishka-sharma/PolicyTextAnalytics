About travel audience
travel audience operates a data driven travel advertising platform.
Our platform connects performance-oriented advertisers with our network of publishers, reaching millions of travelers.
Our data-driven travel advertising platform consists of two major components: Our publisher network publishes third-party content via native advertising and our own demand-side-platform provides end-to-end data driven advertising solutions to our partners.

What is digital advertising?
Digital advertising, also called internet advertising, is used by businesses to leverage internet technologies to deliver promotional advertisements to individuals.
Digital advertising includes promotional advertisements and messages delivered through email, social media networks, online advertising on search engines or in mobile applications, banner ads on mobile sites or websites and affiliates programs.
4.
How does digital advertising work and what information is being collected?
==========
Our partners and we use cookies, mobile device advertising identifiers and other similar tracking solutions (we call it here User IDs) to help us collect and store information about the users of websites, social media networks and mobile applications.
Such information is typically stored in the form of a user profile and connected to a User ID.
On the basis of such User ID, we are not able to identify a certain natural person, but are only able to recognize a certain browser or device.
Cookies are an essential part of the internet environment and in digital advertising.
Cookies are small files that can be stored on a computer to contain or communicate certain information.
==========
Cookies can for instance allow a website to log a user in automatically to an online service or provide the user personalized advertising.
Cookies can be deleted at any time from the browser via the browser settings, as described below.
Similarly, mobile device advertising identifiers can be used to recognize a device from a user and allow a user to login automatically to an online service as well as for other services and functionalities.
Any user can also reset the mobile device advertising identifier of his/her mobile device in the settings menu of the device, as also described below.
The technologies our partners and we use may collect the following information about online user activity, for example:
Travel related information, such as search queries and booking information on our partner websites (for example origin, destination, number of passengers, hotel stars, duration, record locator, booking values, etc.) and other similar information relating to the use of websites and mobile applications of our partners;
Device and browser information, such as information relating to a mobile device or a browser (e.g. browser version, hardware model, operation system version and mobile network information);
Location-based information, such as proximate location information which our partners or we may infer if we are legally allowed to do so from information such as from an IP address or GPS data or other online location-based information on which our partners and we sometimes rely on for the quality of our services;
Browsing history, such as information regarding which websites or mobile applications users have visited or used.

Use and sharing of the data collected as part of digital advertising
The information we and our partners collect and receive are used by us to display personalized advertising that we believe is of interest to the users either directly or in collaboration with our partners, to settle accounts with our partners for advertising campaigns using our services, to analyse and improve our services, and to analyse the effect of our partners’ advertising campaigns.
For such purposes and to the extent legally permitted, we might connect different collected data sources (from our partners or affiliates) to create user profiles in order to show the most relevant advertising to the user.
Also with regard to such user profiles, we cannot identify a natural person on the basis of the information collected and used by us.
We do not share the collected information with third parties, other than described in the following: If we are legally allowed to do so, we may share information with other companies of the Amadeus Group, which likewise use the data for the purposes as described above only.
Only to the extent necessary for the aforementioned purposes, we might also share information with the following:
Social Media Advertising: We might use social media advertising platforms to reach users on these platforms to deliver personalized ads.
In these cases, the privacy terms of these social media advertising platforms are relevant for the user regarding the use of the information by such platforms.
==========
Supply Side Platforms (SSPs): We work with SSPs and might share the cookie ID with them.
In this case we use a tracking script of these SSPs so they can set a cookie and provide us with bid requests for relevant users.
Please find here more information about SSPs.
Demand Side Platforms (DSPs): We also work with and might share information with third party DSPs like Google DBM or others.
Please find here more information about DSPs.

What rights do users have concerning the data collected as part of digital advertising?
Due to the fact that we may not be able to identify a natural person on the basis of the information collected and used by us, we may not be able to answer requests from individual users which information we hold about them or to comply with a request to delete information relating to a certain individual.
However, any user has the automated capability to ensure that he/she does not receive advertising personalized by us in the future.
We explain how this works below:
7.
How can a user ensure that he/she does not receive personalized display advertising from travel audience?
==========
7.1 Cookie Settings in the Browser
First, in order to prevent browser-based personalized advertising, a user can change the cookie settings in the browser so that cookies are no longer stored.
The user will thus prevent the cookies needed for retargeting from being placed on the computer.
To that end, please change the appropriate browser settings.
The specific settings can differ depending on the browser used:
For Microsoft Internet Explorer, you will find the relevant instructions at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies
For Mozilla Firefox, you will find the relevant instructions at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences
For Google Chrome, you will find the relevant instructions at https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en
For Safari, you will find the relevant instructions at https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21411?locale=de_DE&viewlocale=en_US
If the user uses another browser, or if the displayed links do not lead to the desired result, then generally further information can be found by entering the name and manufacturer of the browser and the terms “cookies” and “settings” in an Internet search engine.
==========
Please keep in mind that when a user blocks cookies, certain website services that require the processing of cookies (such as certain shopping carts on ecommerce sites) may no longer work.
7.2 Cookie Opt-Out
Any user may furthermore inform us that he/she no longer wants personalized advertising provided by us by activating the following button icon.
Your current cookie status:

Please keep in mind that in this case we will set a cookie that contains information indicating that you do not wish to receive advertising personalized by us through retargeting.
When you have deactivated the acceptance of cookies (see above) in your browser or when you delete the cookies, we will no longer be able to know that you do not want any retargeting.
In this case, you will have to reactivate the aforementioned button icon, thereby ensuring that the relevant cookie is permanently stored.
The same applies when you use a browser other than the one you are currently using.
7.3 Opt-Out on Mobile Devices
An opt-out of cookies as described above regarding browser-based personalized advertising may not prevent personalized advertising on mobile devices.
In order to opt out of personalized mobile advertising, a user can reset the mobile device advertising identifier of his/her mobile device in the settings menu of the device.
==========
More information on how to do this can be found here: https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.
Please note that we may still display advertising to the user following his/her opt-out, but that such advertisement will no longer be personalized or relevant to the user.

==========

We may change our products and services or use new technologies.
We will then publish an updated version of this Product Privacy Policy on our website as well as on other appropriate websites.
