==========
Office.com, a service from WinStarSM, is produced by Office.com Inc.
This Privacy Policy contains important information; please read it carefully.
We also encourage you to review our Terms of Service.
==========
Because the success of Office.com is dependent on building and maintaining goodwill with our users, we are committed to implementing measures designed to respect and protect your privacy.
Moreover, we see it as our responsibility to set an example, and to help establish standards for privacy on the Internet.
Office.com respects the privacy of visitors to our web site.
While we do collect information from our users, we do not release personally identifiable information without your permission, except as set forth within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, and other published guidelines.
==========
Office.com reviews its privacy practices from time to time.
We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page for updates to our Privacy Policy.
To contact Office.com about privacy issues, to report a violation of our Privacy Policy, or to raise any other issue, please e-mail us at privacy@office.com.
==========
The Information We Gather Office.com gathers two types of information about users:
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-personally identifiable information is information that does not identify a specific individual.
When a visitor arrives at our site, we collect the IP address, operating system and browser software used.
An IP address (which is not the same as an e-mail address) can tell us the user's internet service provider and, based on that, can suggest the geographic location of the connection.
We also collect information about which pages they visit, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks they "click."
==========
For the same purposes, we use "cookies" -- small text files placed on your computer's hard drive -- to help track your usage of our site, including what advertising you have seen.
Cookies don't include personal information about you, but they are unique to each user, which lets the Office.com computers distinguish between users, and personalize your experience if you have previously provided information about yourself.
Cookies are only read by the Office.com computer that placed them, and cannot execute any code or virus.
==========
Most web browsers give you the ability to control whether, and to what extent, they will accept cookies.
For more information on how to do this, please refer to your browser's documentation.
==========
(Note: if you disable or limit cookies, you may not be able to access certain parts of the Office.com site.)
Non-personally identifiable information also includes personally identifiable information of many people that has been aggregated to arrive at a general statistic; an example might be the number of female users who visit a particular part of the Office.com site in a particular week.
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally Identifiable Information is information that relates to an identified individual.
In certain areas of the Office.com site -- for example, when registering to become a member, or purchasing a product -- we require you to supply personally identifiable information.
The amount of information required depends on the area that you wish to use, but might include your name, street address, email address, telephone number, and when applicable, credit card information.
==========
The Office.com site is not targeted to children (minors under thirteen years of age), and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children without obtaining parental consent.
Before registering with Office.com, we ask that children have their parents read our Privacy Policy, and we encourage children to include a parent or guardian in the registration process.
Office.com does not control the acts of its users.
==========
You should be aware that, if you disclose personally identifiable information on a bulletin board or in a chat room, guestbook, or other forum, others may collect that information and use it to send you unsolicited e-mail from outside Office.com, or for other purposes.
In the event that you encounter any Office.com user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact privacy@office.com.
How We Use (and Do Not Use) the Information We Gather.
Non-personally identifiable information: We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher-quality, more useful services by performing statistical analyses of users' activities, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Office.com web site.
==========
We also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their web sites.
We collect non-personally identifiable information and aggregate it, in order to analyze general trends and usage patterns.
This information helps us determine how our site is being used, helps us identify popular areas, and helps determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities.
All of this lets us build higher-quality, more useful services.
==========
We provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, affiliates, and other current and potential business partners.
Personally identifiable information: At registration, Office.com provides notice to potential Office.com registrants that personally identifiable information will be collected during the registration process.
This Privacy Policy itself is also notice that such information is collected.
==========
We may use this information in a number of ways:
to customize various aspects of the Office.com site to your preferences
to pre-complete online forms.
For example, if you have provided a shipping address, the Office.com system may automatically fill in that information on an order form.
This is simply a convenience -- no information is released to anyone unless you authorize its release, such as by clicking a "Submit" button.
to determine which advertisements or sponsor messages will appear on your screen
to send you Office.com solicitations, product announcements, and the like that we feel may be of interest to you.
==========
You may "opt out" of receiving these materials as provided below.
as may be necessary to support the operation of the Office.com site, such as for billing, account maintenance, and record-keeping purposes
We can disclose your personally-identifiable information to third parties as follows:
with your authorization, such as when you click on a "submit order" or similar button when placing an order
if you do not "opt out" of receiving promotional materials (as discussed below), we can release personally identifiable contact information regarding you to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
==========
To our contractors and consultants, and professional advisors (such as attorneys or accountants), but only to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only under reasonable confidentiality restrictions.
As required by law, including court and governmental orders, and civil subpoenas
As we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business
If you partake (or we reasonably suspect that you are partaking) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, to the extent we feel is necessary to inform, and cooperate with, law enforcement agencies or other appropriate authorities.
==========
Except as provided above, we will not release your credit card information to any third party unless necessary to complete a transaction between you and the third party.
"Opting Out:" Although you must provide registration information if you wish to use Office.com features that require registration, you may choose to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials from Office.com and/or its affiliates, advertisers, or other business partners.
"Opting out" is an option at registration, and you will also often be given the opportunity to "opt out" in certain individual transactions.
==========
You may also "opt out" of receiving promotional information from Office.com and/or from third parties at any time by contacting us at privacy@Office.com.
You may also contact those third parties directly.
==========
If and when we sponsor promotions or sweepstakes, or third parties sponsor promotions or sweepstakes in conjunction with Office.com, either Office.com or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the promotion or sweepstakes.
That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes.
If Office.com offers an e-mail service, Office.com will not inspect, or disclose to others, the contents of messages sent through that service except with the specific consent of the sender or recipient, or in the narrowly-defined situations established under federal law.
Third-party use of personal information.
==========
The Office.com web site contains links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites.
Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites' use of any information.
==========
Keep in mind that, while Office.com encourages all third parties involved -- such as our affiliates and advertisers -- to adhere to our policies regarding our users' privacy and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any acts or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from Office.com or independently.
Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with Office.com (or who claims association with Office.com) who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact privacy@office.com; we will be happy to forward your message to the third party.
==========
Changing or deleting personal information.
You may view and, if you wish, change certain personally identifiable information by going to the Member Center, and selecting to Modify Your Account Information.
Note, of course, that you cannot view or change certain "automatic" information, such as the number of advertisements that may have been displayed during a session.
Also, for security reasons, you will not be able to see your credit card number (if you have supplied one) or your password.
==========
If you would like to have your personally identifiable information removed from Office.com's database, please contact us at privacy@Office.com, and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request.
Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within Office.com databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information.
The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, we reserve the right, from time to time, to re-contact former Office.com users.
