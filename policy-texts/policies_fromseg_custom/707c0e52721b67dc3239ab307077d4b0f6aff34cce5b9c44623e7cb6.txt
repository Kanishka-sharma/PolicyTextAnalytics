Revised: July 25, 2016
LiveRamp, an Acxiom company, provides Connectivity Services designed to enable our clients to reach consumers with greater efficiency and more relevant messages across various digital channels, including online, mobile, email, and addressable TV.
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help consumers, clients and partners understand how the LiveRamp Connectivity Services work, what data is involved in these services and what measures we take to respect the privacy of the data with which we have been entrusted.
LiveRamp Connectivity Services
The LiveRamp Connectivity Services include data onboarding, linking, and distribution to many of the players in the digital advertising industry to enable smarter targeting with more relevant messages and more accurate measurement.
Onboarding is a service that loads data collected offline into the digital ecosystem, so it can be used for digital advertising purposes.
The players include advertisers wishing to reach consumers, advertising supported websites, advertising supported apps, email marketing services, and addressable TV channels.
Today consumers interact with advertisers and brands through a variety of channels – offline and digital.
This cross channel interaction is known as “omni channel.”
==========
LiveRamp services are used to support these interactions for several types of entities in the digital advertising industry, including:
Marketing Platform Partners: LiveRamp has established partnerships for distribution with hundreds of media and technology providers in the online, app, email, and addressable TV ecosystem.
With these partners, LiveRamp enables advertisers to display relevant ads to specific individuals through websites, mobile apps, email, and addressable TVs.
Third Party Data Providers: LiveRamp also offers services that allow third-party data providers, including Acxiom Information Products, to onboard their offline marketing data and sync their digital data in such a way that it can be used by advertisers to display more relevant ads and email marketing to consumers.
Brands: LiveRamp offers connectivity services to digital marketers that advertise to consumers:
* Brands can onboard their proprietary offline and digital data for their own use to target advertising messages on their own website and/or their own mobile apps, and in email.
* Brands can use their own onboarded proprietary data along with third party onboarded data to offer more relevant ads and email marketing through LiveRamp partners.
* Brands can also connect performance information about their omni-channel ad and email marketing campaigns to understand how to improve the effectiveness of future campaigns.
Performance information includes data about who viewed the ad, who clicked on the ad, as well as who actually responded in some way to the offer.
==========
Other Digital Partners: There are other players in the digital advertising industry that LiveRamp partners with to enable our Connectivity Services.
These include cookie, mobile and addressable TV match partners that allow LiveRamp to recognize an individual across various channels.
==========
In addition, LiveRamp sells Connectivity Services to other third party advertising service providers to help facilitate their offerings.
Connectivity Services Work Across Channels
Due to technical differences across the channels, LiveRamp uses different approaches tailored specifically to each channel to provide our Connectivity Services.
The common basis of these services is an ID that LiveRamp assigns to an individual.
==========
The ID may be used in a personally identifiable state or in a manner that is not used to identify the individual, depending on the channel and the use.
LiveRamp collects certain types of information in connection with our Connectivity Services.
==========
This includes personal information such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number if permitted by our partners and clients through policy notices they have provided to consumers.
We also collect non-personal information such as IP address, mobile device ID, and browser and operating system type and version.
In addition, we handle, process, and share both personal and non-personal information with our marketing platform partners in the course of performing our services; however we do not retain or use this information for our own internal business purposes unless permitted by our clients.
==========
LiveRamp Cookie-based Connectivity Services:
Connectivity Services for cookie-based integrations are based on a LiveRamp ID and a LiveRamp cookie that together identify a browser.
The cookie containing the ID is set when a consumer visits the website of one of our cookie match partners as a registered user, or when a consumer opens certain emails from a cookie match partner.
Because match partners know the consumer, they enable LiveRamp to recognize the consumer as well and set the LiveRamp cookie containing the appropriate ID.
For example, our match partners may enable us to place or recognize a cookie on your computer or device, and our match partners may share personal information with us, such as your name, postal address, or email address.
LiveRamp uses the personal information to link an ID to information stored in your browser or device.
We also may collect information such as the device’s IP address and browser or operating systems type and version.
We use this information to recognize consumers across different channels and platforms over time for the purposes of facilitating online advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
For cookie-based integrations, three types of connections are maintained.
==========
The first is the connection between LiveRamp cookies and marketing platform partner cookies, a sync that enables LiveRamp to distribute advertising data to partners on behalf of our clients.
In this case, the LiveRamp cookies containing LiveRamp IDs are synced with cookies set by our marketing platform partners.
==========
The second connection is between LiveRamp cookies and third-party data providers.
In this case, third party data providers onboard their data and LiveRamp matches it to the appropriate LiveRamp IDs, thereby connecting the data to the correct LiveRamp cookie.
Finally, the third connection is between a brand’s data and the LiveRamp cookie.
When marketers onboard their data, LiveRamp associates the brand’s data with the LiveRamp ID, thus connecting this data to the LiveRamp cookies.
==========
Once all these connections are made, a marketer can use them to understand how ad or email marketing campaigns perform and deliver ads or offline marketing to specific individuals when they visit a website with ad inventory.
For example, we may facilitate the delivery of an ad to an individual in his or her web browser based on a purchase he or she made in a physical retail store, or we may enable a brand to send a personalized marketing email to that individual based on the fact that he or she visited a particular website.
==========
LiveRamp cookies are set with an RLCDN.com name and expire after 180 days unless they are renewed or refreshed.
Unlike web “tracking” cookies, LiveRamp cookies do not “track” users’ behavior across websites.
Instead, LiveRamp cookies are used to recognize an individual so that relevant ads and email marketing can be delivered to the intended recipient.
LiveRamp Mobile Connectivity Services:
Connectivity Services for mobile ID integrations are similar to cookie integrations except they use the mobile advertising ID assigned to the device instead of a cookie – namely the Apple ID for Advertising (IDFA) and the Android Advertising ID (AAID).
We associate the LiveRamp ID with the mobile ID just like we would associate the cookie.
LiveRamp links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to mobile devices through the LiveRamp ID.
Mobile advertising IDs do not expire like cookies.
==========
Instead the device gives the user the ability to change the ID at any time, thus breaking the connection between the old ID and the device.
Consistent with our online policy, LiveRamp IDs are used to recognize individuals so relevant ads and offline marketing can be delivered and campaigns can be measured.
LiveRamp Addressable TV Connectivity Services:
Connectivity Services for addressable TV integrations are similar to online and mobile services except they use the subscriber ID assigned by the carrier to the set-top box instead of a cookie or a mobile ID.
We associate the LiveRamp ID with the subscriber ID just like we would associate the cookie or mobile ID.
==========
LiveRamp links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to subscriber IDs through the LiveRamp ID.
Addressable TV subscriber IDs do not expire like cookies.
==========
Instead the carrier gives the user the ability to determine if they wish to see targeted advertising on their TV.
Consistent with our online and mobile policy, LiveRamp IDs are used only to recognize individuals so relevant ads can be delivered and campaigns can be measured.
Personally Identifiable versus Anonymous Connectivity:
LiveRamp may recognize an online, mobile or addressable TV user in two ways.
First when our match partner shares personally identifiable information (PII) with us, or second when they share other information with us that is not used to identify individuals.
When they share PII, we can recognize a consumer on an identifiable basis.
==========
However, to preserve user privacy, we create a unique LiveRamp ID when we combine it with other anonymous data.
LiveRamp, like its Acxiom parent, values the preservation of consumer privacy, designing its systems and services to treat PII and other information that is not used to identify individuals with utmost care.
LiveRamp chooses the appropriate LiveRamp ID, either PII or de-identified, based on the services it has been asked to perform; it does not mingle the two in any way that compromises user protections or choice.
Your Choices and How to Contact Us about LiveRamp Data Connectivity Services
Opting-Out of LiveRamp Connectivity Services
LiveRamp gives consumers the opportunity to opt-out of all our Connectivity Services.
==========
Click here to learn about permanent email-based opt-out features and to access our cookie-based opt-out.
We also offer a mobile device ID opt-out here.
LiveRamp is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and adheres to the DAA Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and Multi-Site Data, as well as related guidance.
LiveRamp subscribes to the DAA’s industry-wide cookie opt-out mechanism that can be found here and its mobile device ID opt out available through its AppChoices app.
Consumers who choose to opt out through these DAA mechanisms do not need to opt out of the equivalent mechanism with LiveRamp.
==========
Keep in mind that opting out of LiveRamp through our opt-out channels or through the DAA does not disable advertisements altogether.
Instead, opting out means that LiveRamp services will no longer be used to facilitate targeted advertising to your browser, device, or email address.
In other words, you will still see advertisements and receive email marketing, but they will be less relevant to you.
If you create a new email address, reset the mobile advertising ID on your device, or use a new browser, you will need to apply the appropriate opt out to that new email address, new device ID, and/or new browser as opt-outs are not necessarily transferred between email addresses, browsers, or devices.
==========
Opting-Out of LiveRamp Connectivity Services
LiveRamp requires that our partners meet the same high standards we have.
We contractually require that our match partners employ notice and choice mechanisms, and we work with other information service providers and our partners to assist them in following their respective industry standards.
