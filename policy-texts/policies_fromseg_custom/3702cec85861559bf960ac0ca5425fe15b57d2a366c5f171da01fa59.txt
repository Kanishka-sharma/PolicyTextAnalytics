Website Terms and Conditions
                  The Ask Jeeves UK website is operated by the Ask Jeeves UK
                    Partnership and any reference to Ask Jeeves, Jeeves or we
                    is a reference to that partnership.
By using the Ask Jeeves UK website and its associated services
                  (Website), you agree to be bound by the following terms
                  and conditions (Terms).
==========
The Terms may be updated from
                  time to time without notice, so please check back on a regular
                  basis.
Your continued use of the website after Jeeves has updated
                  the Terms constitutes acceptance of the Terms from time to
                  time.
The Website
                  The Ask Jeeves Website is a question-answering website for
                    Internet users.
==========
The Website provides standard search engine
                    functionality as well as access to shopping services, email
                    facilities and other services that may be available on the
                    Website from time to time.
All content and services provided on the Website are provided
                  in good faith on an as-is basis.
Whilst Ask Jeeves has taken
                  considerable time and effort compiling the content and making
                  available the services on the Website, Ask Jeeves:

makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy
                    of the content or the suitability or reliability of the services;
is not responsible for the timeliness or otherwise of the
                    content or any services being made available to you; and
is not responsible for the timeliness, deletion or failure
                    to store any user communications or personalisation and website
                    customisation settings.
==========
Your use of a particular Ask Jeeves service (for example, Jeeves
                    Mobile Service) may also be subject to terms and conditions
                    specific to that service in addition to these Terms.
Jeeves
                    will post these service-specific terms and conditions on
                    the webpage associated with that service.
All service-specific
                    terms and conditions are incorporated into these Terms.
If
                    there is any inconsistency between service-specific terms
                    and conditions and these Terms, the Terms prevail.

==========
You should read carefully the terms and conditions of use
                  of any third party site before using that site or proceeding
                  with any online or offline transaction with the third party.
Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation
                  in the promotions of, third parties found on or through the
                  Website, including payment and delivery of related goods or
                  services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations
                  associated with such dealings (including any implied term of
                  merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular
                  purpose and any term as to the provision of services to a standard
                  of reasonable care and skill or as to non-infringement of any
                  intellectual property right) are solely between you and such
                  third parties.
Ask Jeeves has developed the Ask
                    Jeeves Editorial Policy and the Ask
                    Jeeves Approved Scheme with the intention of providing
                    you with access to reliable third party sites.
However, Ask
                    Jeeves cannot guarantee that the third party sites accessible
                    from the Website comply with the terms of the Policy or the
                    Scheme.
Notwithstanding anything in the Ask Jeeves Editorial Policy
                  or the Ask Jeeves Approved Scheme, the inclusion of a link
                  to a third party's site does not imply endorsement by Ask Jeeves
                  of the third party, its site, or any goods, services or content
                  featured on or available from that site.
Ask Jeeves will not
                  be liable to you in any circumstances for:


the failure of a third party to comply with the Ask Jeeves
                    Editorial Policy or the Ask Jeeves Approved Scheme;
the failure of a third party site to comply with the Distance
                    Selling Regulations or any other applicable laws or regulations
                    from time to time;
any goods, services or content you acquire through a third
                    party's site; or
any damage, loss, cost or expense arising from the presence
                    of a third party on the Website or your use of a third party's
                    site.

                    or services available on or accessible through the Website,
                    including any implied term of merchantability, satisfactory
                    quality, fitness for a particular purpose and any term as
                    to the provision of services to a standard of reasonable

                    property right.
