GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE

a 1-Year Limitations Period
    
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE WEBSITE, SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE INSTITUTED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER WAIVED AND BARRED.
==========
ALL ACTIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN ABOVE.
b Binding Arbitration
    
If You and CheckPeople cannot resolve a Claim through negotiations, either party may elect to have the Claim finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s).
YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT WITH A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party.
==========
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Except as otherwise provided for herein, CheckPeople will pay the AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedures 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, You hereby agree to reimburse CheckPeople for all payments disbursed that are your obligation to reimbursed under the AAA Rules.
If you are unable to pay the arbitration fee, CheckPeople will pay it directly upon receiving a written request and a sworn statement that you are unable to pay.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to resolve, except that issues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration provision for a Court of Competent Jurisdiction to resolve.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through document submission, through telephone, or online.
The arbitrator will issue a decision in writing, but need only provide a statement of reasons if requested by a party.
==========
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
CheckPeople may litigate to compel arbitration in court, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
c Restrictions Against Joinder of Claims
    
You and CheckPeople agree that any arbitration shall be limited to each Claim individually.
YOU AND CHECKPEOPLE HEREBY AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN YOUR OR CHECKPEOPLE'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then, to the full extent allowable under applicable law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration, and (2) there is no right for any Claim to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to employ class action procedures, and (3) there is no right of authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf either of the general public or any other individuals.
==========
d Remedies in Aid of Arbitration; Equitable Relief
    
This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or CheckPeople from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral award, from a Court of Competent Jurisdiction.
Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or CheckPeople from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary.
As used herein, "Court of Competent Jurisdiction" means any federal or state court: (1) that has jurisdiction over the subject matter; and (2) that is located in the State of California.
e Laws of the State of California
    
This Agreement, including without limitation this Agreement's interpretation, shall be treated as though this Agreement were executed and performed in the State of California and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law principles.
==========
The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party.
THE PROPER VENUE FOR ANY JUDICIAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN OR NEAREST TO PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA.
THE PARTIES HEREBY STIPULATE TO, AND AGREE TO WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO, THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS, AND FURTHER EXPRESSLY SUBMIT TO EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICE OF PROCESS.
