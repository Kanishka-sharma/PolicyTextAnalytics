Zeta’s participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personally identifiable information that is subject to this Privacy Policy and is received from the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland and stored by Zeta (the “EU Personal Information”).
Zeta will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles in respect of such EU Personal Information.
Zeta’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles.
In particular, Zeta remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Zeta proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
If you are located in the EU, you have the right to access, correct, or have removed from our systems any of your EU Personal Information that Zeta may store.

Dispute Resolution
 If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Zeta Interactive has further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.
Do Not Track
 Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting.
Zeta does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
