Rubicon Project Desktop Ad Platform Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 19, 2014
Rubicon Project is committed to transparency, and we want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to you, and the choices that are available to you.
This privacy policy governs Rubicon Project’s collection and use of data on websites and apps that use Rubicon Project’s technology to sell and purchase ads.
This privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of data on our website (http://www.rubiconproject.com) — that information can be found here.
Data We Collect
When you visit a website or application that uses our technology, we do not collect any information that identifies you.
Instead, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you and your device ( “User Data”).
Some of this User Data, including for example your IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device, and may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere, but none of this data identifies you individually.
User Data that we may collect includes: IP address, domain, browser type and language, referring website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search keywords, visitor activities and actions on publisher’s sites, browser history, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation (including city, country, zip code, and potentially geographic coordinates), click data, types of advertisements viewed, and information about visitor’s device including device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type.
To be clear, we do not collect any “sensitive personal data” as defined in the European Union.
==========
We collect User Data using the following standard web technologies:

“Tags and Pixels” are blocks of code that we and our customers may use to track your navigation of websites or apps using our technology, and your browsing behavior.
We use pixels to coordinate User Data with our customers and other third parties.
“Cookies” are data files that often include an anonymous unique identifier, and are placed on a visitor’s device or computer.
We use cookies on our customers’ websites in order to operate our technology and collect User Data.
For more information about cookies visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org
“SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” are blocks of code similar to tags and pixels that are embedded into an app that allow us to track certain information relating to your use of apps using our technology.
Additionally, we use other technologies, including locally stored objects, to collect User Data in order to assist with the delivery of ads and to provide reporting to our customers.
Finally, we use standard device identifiers, for example the “IDFA” advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices, to track your use of mobile apps.
==========
These technologies enable us, and customers using our technology, to better understand and target our customers’ audiences.
How We Use Data
We primarily rely on collecting and using User Data to better match advertiser campaigns with appropriate audiences, including visitors of our sellers’ sites or apps.
In particular, we (and our customers) may use User Data to conduct Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA), which delivers you targeted advertising based on information that we (or our customers) believe will be of particular interest to you.
For more information about how OBA works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.
==========
Our other uses of User Data may include, for example, to:

Operate and improve our technology;
Conduct research and development;
Create profiles and infer demographic and interest-based information about non-personally identified users, and to place each user into segments that are targetable in our ad platform;
Enable standard advertising controls;
Prepare reports that summarize visitor activity;
Report on ad performance, campaign reporting, and campaign forecasting;
Determine non-personally identified user response to advertisements and promotions; and
Protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.
At times, we may also use User Data provided to us by our customers or other third parties to better provide you with ad content that is more likely to be relevant to your interests.
Data Retention
We may store the User Data we collect, such as IP address and other information described above, for up to 90 days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
We may store the aggregated summary data (which for example, does not include IP address or other information that may be tied to a particular browser or device) for longer than 90 days.
Sharing of Data

We share User Data information with others, including advertisers, advertising agencies, and website and app publishers, for a variety of reasons.
For example:
We share User Data with our customers to help them deliver targeted advertisements and to help them evaluate whether a particular ad campaign may be of interest to you.
==========
We may share User Data for the purposes of a business deal (or negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets.
Business deals may include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.
We may share User Data for legal, protection, security, and safety purposes, including:

to comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests and legal process;
to protect the rights and property of Rubicon Project, our agents, customers, and others, including enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of use and protecting our network and physical assets; and/or
in an emergency, including protecting the safety of our employees and agents, our customers, or any person.
==========
We may share information with parties who may use that information to provide us with services or do work for us.
Data Our Customers Collect
Our customers and other third parties who use our technology may use their own tags, pixels, or other similar technology (or those of their other affiliates) within their advertisements and on certain websites.
These customers maintain their own privacy policies and processes.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of customers that use our technology.
==========
Your Choices
There are many ways to opt-out of OBA we may conduct using our technology.
If you opt-out of OBA, we will continue to collect the same User Data described above.
However, this information won’t be used to target you with interest based ads.
Display
Should you wish to opt-out of OBA for ads you receive on websites you access on a desktop computer or through a web browser (such as Chrome and Internet Explorer), which are provided using our “display” technology, you can use any of the following three mechanisms.
==========
First, because we are a member of the NAI and adhere to the NAI’s code of conduct, you can opt-out of OBA by participating companies, including Rubicon Project, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
Second, you can visit to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
Third, for users located in the European Union, Rubicon Project also adheres to the Interactive Advertising Bureau of Europe’s OBA Framework.
==========
Accordingly, EU-based users can opt-out of OBA through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.
Please note that these opt-outs operate by placing a cookie on your device that is unique to the browser and device you use to opt-out.
If you change browsers or computers, or delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again.
You also can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to block most cookies, including ours.
Mobile
Should you wish to opt-out of OBA for ads you receive while using apps on a mobile device, which are provided using our “mobile’ technology, you can enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” feature on your iOS device, or select the “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” feature on your Android device.
For instructions on how to do so, please consult your device settings.
This opt-out must be performed on each device on which you wish to be opted-out.
==========
Security
We use many different measures to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems.
No transmission of information, however, is guaranteed to be completely secure.
In particular, we cannot guarantee that your data will not be disclosed, altered, or accessed accidentally, or through unlawful or unauthorized acts of others.
==========
Changes
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time.
If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page.
