Your Information
For nearly 100 years, Walgreens has established itself as one of the most trusted healthcare providers in America.
Our company has always been committed to providing our valued customers with the best services available.
==========
Now, as we offer our convenient online pharmacy service, we want you to be assured that your personal information is properly safeguarded.
In the following sections, you will learn how Walgreens secures your private information.
==========
When you order prescription drugs, our registration process asks you to provide us with a limited amount of personal and health-related information.
This information is necessary to process your prescription order.
We understand that you may not wish to share medical information with others and for that reason, we have provided you with the means to control access to your information.
Once you have both registered and completed a prescription order, we will mail a personal identification number (PIN) to you.
==========
You should keep your PIN and your password confidential.
When you enter your PIN you will be able to access your own prescription history* at Walgreens.
If you provide us with information about your drug allergies and/or existing medical conditions, our pharmacists will use third party drug information providers to evaluate that information against any prescription you order.
==========
It is your responsibility to review your account and keep it up to date.
*Prescription information will be available for up to 15 months from the date the prescription was filled.

How We Use Your Information

You may choose to supply personalized information that will enable you to receive individualized customer service that we cannot offer anonymous users.
That customer service may include notices about updates to our web site, e-mail reminders, messaging with Walgreens pharmacists, and medical content from Mayo Clinic Health Information.
We are the ONLY online pharmacy that Mayo Clinic Health Information has chosen to provide with its trusted medical information.
==========
We will not intentionally release your particular prescription information other than to you, our contracted fulfillment parties (if any), your authorized representative, or your prescriber or other authorized medical professional.
We may forward your prescription information to your insurance plan, so that we can handle reimbursement of your prescription purchase for your convenience.
We may share non-medical information and summary or aggregate statistical information and data with our content providers, suppliers, vendors and other third parties.
You may elect to decline these additional e-mails by clicking See & Edit My Account.
Your medical information will not be intentionally provided to third parties unless: we have received your permission; we believe in good faith that we are legally obligated to do so; or such release is necessary to protect our rights or property.
In compliance with the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, Walgreens.com will provide the Drug Enforcement Agency with the name and address of each individual who purchases products on Walgreens.com which contain the ingredients ephedrine or pseudophedrine.
Receiving E-mail from Walgreens

We will contact you by e-mail throughout the ordering process.
Certain prescription-related issues may require your response to complete your order successfully.
==========
Please be sure to check your e-mail regularly once you have placed your order online.
If we are unable to reach you by e-mail, we may try to contact you by phone.
==========
In addition, we may occasionally send useful information to you by e-mail, including new products and services offered by us or other organizations.
Although it still may be necessary for our pharmacists to contact you regarding your prescription, you may decline to receive any additional e-mail concerning new products and services by clicking See & Edit My Account in the pharmacy department.
Click Edit Personal Information, and select No in answer to the question about receiving e-mail.
Then click Done.

==========
You maintain the security of your medical information by keeping your user name, password, PIN and other personal-identifying information confidential.
In addition, Walgreens customer service representatives will never ask you or call you to request your password.
