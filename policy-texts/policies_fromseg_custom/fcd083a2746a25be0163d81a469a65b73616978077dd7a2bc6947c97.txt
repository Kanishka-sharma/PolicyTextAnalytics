Our Business
Beachfront Media, LLC has a video platform.
We use our proprietary technology to offer advertising solutions to our clients, which includes working with advertisers to deliver their advertising campaigns across our network of publishers and application (“app”) developers (our “Platform”).
We offer products and services that help online publishers, agencies, and ad networks manage and deliver online advertising in their videos.
We also own websites, and offer technology that allows content providers to place their content into applications.
As a consumer, when you see an advertisement before you watch a video, we may help deliver that ad from or for an advertiser to the website or application that has made the video available to you.
We also provide a marketplace, where buyers and sellers of online video advertising space can connect and do business.
We are not in the business of collecting, using, or selling consumer data; however we do offer tools and technologies to advertisers and publishers that allow them to collect and use user data.
This is done primarily to enable these buyers and sellers of online video-advertising space to try and ensure that the audience they desire sees their ads and that the advertising itself is delivered and the performance of the advertising can be analyzed.
Types of data that may be used for this purpose range from behavioral or interest-related information to geographical or demographic user data.
We adhere to the NAI Code of Conduct.
==========
Information Collection and How it is Collected
Personally-Identifiable Information.
We do not collect personally-identifiable information in order to help our clients buy, sell, and deliver online video advertising.
“Personally-Identifiable Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other information We collect may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you.
==========
There may be some opportunities, for example when you use this Site, where you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal details.
For example, if you were interested in becoming one of our clients or using our Services you could provide us with contact details through our Site.
Where we collect personally-identifiable information you will have clear notification of what we are doing so that you can choose not to provide it.
==========
Non-Personally-Identifiable Information.
Non-personally-identifiable information is information that, without additional information, cannot be linked to a specific individual by us.
We may collect non-personally-identifiable information while you are visiting our Site or the website of one of our advertisers or Web publishers (collectively, “”customers”).
For example, while providing the Services to website publishers, advertisers and those working for them, we may collect your IP address, Web pages that you visit, the time and date, and whether or not you clicked on various advertisements (collectively, “Web Surfing Data”).
Technologies We May Use For Data Collection
We use different types of technologies to collect non-personally-identifiable information, including cookies, action tags, Web beacons, and single pixel GIFs.
Cookies.
A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes when you request through your browser to receive a particular Web page or content.
We use these cookies for three purposes.
==========
Persistent Cookies for Customers Use of Our Site.
For our customers who login to our Site so that they may use our Services, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site.
This functionality works as it does on many websites that work to enable you to have an easier experience logging in and navigating their websites.
We do not use persistent cookies in connection with helping our customers buy, sell, and deliver online video advertising.
Session Cookies to Help Ad Delivery and Accounting.
==========
We utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services, and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and Web traffic routing on the Services.
Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser.
User Data Cookies for Ad Targeting.
We utilize cookies to store user data that can aid in targeting of advertisements.
This data is usually collected by our Customers and used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to a user’s interests.
Use of Cookies By Others.
Also, the Web publisher or advertiser with whom we partner may use cookies, action tags, GIFs, or Web beacons to collect information when you are visiting their websites.
==========
The information they collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, not ours.
You are encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites that you visit.
You can learn more about how cookies and related technologies are used in connection with online advertising and analytics by visiting: http://www.aboutads.info/how-interest-based-ads-work.
==========
Opt-Out Procedure and Cookie Control
Should you wish to opt-out of us placing a cookie on your browser, you can click here to deploy an “opt-out” cookie on your browser.
This cookie, when installed on your browser, will prevent us from placing a new cookie on that browser and from collecting data on that browser.
The NAI’s opt-out tool also allows you to opt-out of the data collection and targeted ad programs of other NAI members.
You may access the NAI opt-out tool here.
Our opt-out tool and the NAI opt-out tool, are cookie-based.
==========
Both opt-out tools only prevent us from collecting data pertaining to you on the browser on which they are installed, and will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies.
If you delete an opt-out cookie from a browser’s cookie files, we may collect data and place a new cookie unless an opt-out cookie is reset on that browser.
If you block third-party cookies from being set on your browser, you may not be able to enjoy some features or functionality, and you may see the same content and advertisements repeatedly on some websites.
Opt-Out Procedure for mobile internet-based or mobile device advertising
Some of our partners may collect information on mobile internet based sites or mobile devices.
Should you wish to opt-out of this type of targeting on both Android and/or IOS platforms please click on the below links:
Android:
https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html#get_started
Text from the Android Developers Guide is below:

The advertising ID is a unique but user-resettable string identifier that lets ad networks and other apps anonymously identify a user.
The user’s advertising ID is made available to apps through APIs provided in Google Play services.
==========
Users can reset their advertising ID at any time, right from the Ads section of the Google Settings app on their devices.
From the same app, users can also opt-out of targeted advertising based on the advertising ID by setting the appropriate ad tracking preference.
When the user opts-out of targeted ads, this ad tracking preference is made available to apps through a Google Play services API.
Apps making use of the advertising ID must check for and respect the user’s ad tracking preference.
Also please note that any use of the advertising ID must abide by the terms of the Google Play Developer Content Policies.
IOS:
http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228
Text from Apple’s US privacy policy is below:
Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
==========
If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com.
Alternatively, if you are using iOS 6 or above operating system on your mobile device, you may opt-out by electing Limit Ad Tracking (Learn More).
If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.
You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information.
Opting out through oo.apple.com applies only to Apple advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks.
However, if you select Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third party apps are not permitted by contract to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier to serve you targeted ads.
==========
