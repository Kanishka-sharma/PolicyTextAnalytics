RCN Privacy Policy

                    RCN understands how important personal privacy is to you and 
                    we are committed to fully protect your rights.
We want our 
                    customers to be aware of what information RCN collects and 
                    how it is handled.
This statement discloses RCN's privacy 
                    practices, including an explanation of which personally identifiable 
                    information about RCN's customers is collected, how the information 
                    is used, with whom the information may be shared, and how 
                    the customer can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

 I. PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
                    & AUTONOMOUS INFORMATION 
To provide reliable, quality services RCN must gather and 
                    collect certain information, both personally identifiable 
                    and autonomous, regarding its customers and potential customers.
A. Personally Identifiable Information 
                    
Some of the information that RCN collects contains details 
                    about the person who provides it that is "personally 
                    identifiable."
Personally identifiable information, includes, 
                    but is not limited to, names (and spouse's name), street addresses, 
                    telephone numbers, identification numbers (such as driver's 
                    license and/or social security number), credit card numbers 
                    and similar types of information identifying the person to 
                    whom such information belongs.
==========
For example, RCN collects personally 
                    identifiable information when customers apply for or change 
                    service, or when RCN answers questions about the company and 
                    its services, in any face-to-face meeting, telephone discussion, 
                    delivered correspondence or use of RCN's services over the 
                    RCN Network.
RCN uses personally identifiable information 
                    (i) for the stated purpose for which such information is gathered; 
                    (ii) for billing and collection purposes; (iii) for provisioning, 
                    auditing and maintaining service; (iv) for legal, financial, 
                    accounting and tax record keeping; and (v) requirements imposed 
                    by governmental authorities.
RCN does not specifically collect personal information from 
                    children.
Therefore we ask children to obtain the consent 
                    of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personal 
                    information.
==========
B. Autonomous Information 
RCN also collects information that is said to be "autonomous" 
                    over the RCN Network.
IP addresses and information collected 
                    via "Cookies" are examples of autonomous information.
Autonomous Information includes cached information (see II.E.
"Customer Communication and Web Navigation").
Autonomous 
                    information does not contain specific details about the identity 
                    of the person who provides it.
==========
Rather, the RCN Network automatically 
                    gathers certain usage and other information for use in the 
                    aggregate to monitor the RCN Network and services, to improve 
                    service offerings and for targeted advertising.
Aggregated 
                    data is compiled into statistical and demographic information 
                    that RCN uses, and may share with others, to show preferences 
                    of its customer base as a whole, but not the preferences of 
                    any individual customers.
Shared aggregated data does not 
                    include a level of detail that will permit anyone to identify 
                    an individual customer's usage or preferences.

RCN'S COLLECTION OF INFORMATION 

A. Registration for Services/Service Orders 
                    
RCN is actively engaged in face-to-face sales, direct marketing 
                    and telemarketing.
Personally identifiable information is 
                    collected through these methods in order for RCN to register 
                    and qualify customers to receive the RCN services.
The information 
                    that RCN receives is fed into RCN's provisioning and billing 
                    systems to enable RCN to deliver and manage the services that 
                    a customer orders.
RCN assures you that any face-to-face, telephone or on-line 
                    inquiry or registration for services (Service Order) that 
                    is submitted to RCN will be treated in accordance with the 
                    terms of this Privacy Statement and Policy.
==========
B. RCN Web Sites 
RCN currently operates several web sites.
Each of these web 
                    sites not only provides information relating to the various 
                    RCN companies and services, but provides a potential customer 
                    with the opportunity to request information about or to subscribe 
                    to the particular RCN services on-line.
The RCN sites also contain links to web sites that are not 
                    affiliated with RCN that may or may not have similar practices 
                    in place to protect the privacy of information that you supply.
==========
RCN encourages everyone to review the privacy statements of 
                    each of the sites that are linked to or accessed from RCN's 
                    web site so that there will be no surprise as to how each 
                    visited site collects, uses and distributes information.
C. Co-Branded Web Sites and Services 
Generally, all personally identifiable information that RCN 
                    collects at any of its web sites or when you speak to an RCN 
                    representative is maintained solely by RCN in accordance with 
                    this privacy statement.
In an effort to provide a diversity 
                    of service selections, RCN from time-to-time teams up with 
                    unaffiliated companies, for example in a co-branded web site.
If information will be collected or maintained by any company 
                    other than RCN, that other company's privacy policy will govern 
                    the treatment of information.
Where possible, RCN requires 
                    that such parties treat such information in accordance with 
                    this Privacy Policy.
D. Service Records 
RCN's telephone switch equipment automatically collects data 
                    (call records) relating to the originating and terminating 
                    telephone numbers involved in each telephone call carried 
                    over the RCN Network, the date, time and duration of the call, 
                    the applicable billing rate, among other types of information 
                    that allows RCN to work with other telephone and wireless 
                    networks to route a call and to permit billing of the call.
RCN's cable television headend equipment collects data relating 
                    to programming selections, including pay-per-view selections 
                    and signal quality for billing purposes, and may be shared 
                    with programmers and program guide providers for marketing 
                    and audit purposes and to measure viewership and customer 
                    satisfaction.
RCN may electronically test the video delivery 
                    system from time-to-time to determine whether customers are 
                    being properly billed for the cable service they receive.
RCN technical support may also remotely query your computer 
                    for information to remotely trouble shoot and to assist diagnosing 
                    a problem that might affect the computer attached to the RCN 
                    cable modem product.
==========
All bills are mailed at regular intervals to the billing 
                    address indicated in a Service Order to the attention of the 
                    account holder only.
RCN customer service representatives, 
                    credit and collections representatives and billing personnel 
                    have access to the billing systems where the call record and/or 
                    billing information is compiled in order to perform the billing 
                    function, answer questions relating to billing and to collect 
                    on overdue accounts RCN may monitor and/or record telephone 
                    calls placed to an RCN customer service and support center 
                    for quality assurance and training purposes.
Third party verification 
                    services, which are independent from RCN, often record follow-up 
                    calls to verify sales made by RCN telemarketers.
RCN also 
                    keeps records relating to complaints about customer on-line 
                    behavior, contacts with RCN customer service and support representatives 
                    and reports of account holder violations of our Internet Access 
                    Agreement.
RCN keeps track of service tickets that are opened 
                    in response to reports of service disruption and RCN customer 
                    service representatives may note your account whenever you 
                    place a service call.
E. Customer Communications and Web Navigation 
                    
RCN does not monitor the content of any on-line communication 
                    (electronic mail (e-mail) or chat conversations).
Should any 
                    personally identifiable or sensitive information be disclosed 
                    while engaged in on-line correspondence or chat that there 
                    is the risk of having the person(s) to whom the information 
                    is addressed collect and use it.
One should also be mindful 
                    that people might be logged into a public chat room without 
                    a discloser's knowledge and take personally identifiable and 
                    sensitive information.
==========
RCN assumes no responsibility for or 
                    control over any such third persons.
Information posted in 
                    chat rooms and newsgroups that RCN operates are deleted on 
                    average every third day to clear posted messages.
E-mail is 
                    deleted from RCN's server once it is downloaded to a customer's 
                    computer.
RCN does not monitor anyone's travel on the World Wide Web.
==========
The RCN Network automatically logs certain information that 
                    is used (1) by the RCN Abuse Department to ensure that all 
                    use of the RCN Internet access service is in accordance with 
                    the RCN Internet Access Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy 
                    and (2) in the aggregate, to understand how efficiently the 
                    RCN Network is operating and being used so that RCN's Network 
                    Engineers can make improvements in the quality of the service.
The logs are maintained on RCN's web servers for approximately 
                    sixty (60) days before being deleted, but the logs are sometimes 
                    deleted at shorter intervals if disk space requirements dictate.
Further, RCN does not maintain Internet Protocol or Universal 
                    Resource Locator [URL] information for purposes of connecting 
                    to individual subscribers and automatically purges such information, 
                    as indicated above, for the subscriber's protection and privacy.
As is common practice in our industry, RCN uses Web caching 
                    software on its network to ensure optimum performance for 
                    our customers.
Such software by its nature captures Internet 
                    Protocol and Universal Resource Locator information to a log 
                    file.
It is RCN's policy not to monitor the captured information 
                    or share it with any external entity, e.g., to build user 
                    preference profiles.
However, such information may be used 
                    in the following instances: 
(1) In the event RCN is served with a Subpoena, Court Order 
                    or other legal instrument, requiring the production of such 
                    records, and; 
(2) RCN's Network Engineers may use this information in the 
                    aggregate, to understand how efficiently the RCN Network is 
                    operating so that they can make improvements in the quality 
                    of the service.
These logs are maintained on RCN's web servers for approximately 
                    sixty (60) days before being deleted, but can be deleted at 
                    shorter intervals if disk space requirements dictate.
==========
F. Cookies 
Cookies are small text files that are utilized to enable 
                    a continuous connection to web sites, making it more convenient 
                    to visit pages within a web site without the need to download 
                    the web site each time.
Cookies will only contain information 
                    that a user may choose to volunteer.
Cookies are meant to 
                    assist the user to visit a web site in a seamless fashion.
Cookies are particularly useful in facilitating Web transactions 
                    that span multiple pages, e.g., making travel arrangements, 
                    online banking, Internet shopping.
==========
Some of the RCN web sites allow customers to perform self-care 
                    on their accounts.
When the individual successfully logs into 
                    the RCN web server, it will place a Cookie containing an identifier 
                    on the customer's hard disk.
As the customer transmits each 
                    subsequent page of self-care information to the server, the 
                    server will ask the individual's computer for the Cookie to 
                    confirm the individual's identity without requiring the individual 
                    to login each time.
The Cookie will not run any programs, 
                    will not carry viruses to or cause malfunction of a computer.
The Cookie will only be read by RCN's web server and used 
                    to expedite customer login in the self-care process.
The "help" portion on the toolbar of most browsers 
                    will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new 
                    Cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you are to 
                    receive a new Cookie, or how to disable Cookies altogether.
However, as Cookies allow your user experience to be enhanced, 
                    and expedite login in RCN's self care process, we recommend 
                    that you leave them turned on.
G. Data Retention 
RCN's Corporate Policy for data retention pertaining to its 
                    customer's Personally Identifiable Information is for the 
                    life of the account, plus an additional five (5) years.
Autonomous 
                    Information is retained by RCN for a period of up to five 
                    to (5) years.
III.
RCN'S USE OF INFORMATION 
RCN is committed to the confidential treatment of all personally 
                    identifiable information that it receives from you, both on 
                    computer servers, physically or otherwise, and secures your 
                    personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure 
                    in secure environments.
==========
To this end, we use industry-standard 
                    methods such as firewalls, encryption and system access controls, 
                    and our security practices are regularly reviewed against 
                    industry best practices by internal staff and independent 
                    third parties.
However, as no computer or network-based product 
                    exists that can provide "perfect security", RCN 
                    can not guarantee your information is completely risk-free.
Furthermore, you should be aware that any information you 
                    include in a message you post to a chat room, forum or other 
                    public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access.
Except as otherwise noted herein, all personally identifiable 
                    information that RCN collects when you sign up for service 
                    is used only for the normal business purpose of offering and 
                    rendering RCN services to you.
It is accessible by RCN employees, 
                    contractors, and installation/sales agents to the extent necessary 
                    for RCN to install, market, sell, provide and monitor the 
                    technical operability of the RCN Network and/or services.
RCN also provides access to personally identifiable information 
                    to the extent required for the tax, accounting, legal and 
                    other professionals hired by RCN to fulfill their fiduciary 
                    or representative duty.
All such professionals are bound to 
                    maintain the confidentiality of information supplied to them 
                    by contractual or ethical obligations.
Personally identifiable 
                    information about video service customers may also be provided 
                    to building owners and agents, auditors, program guide providers, 
                    program services for marketing and audit purposes and to representatives 
                    of a franchising authority to demonstrate material compliance 
                    with the terms of RCN's operating franchises when appropriate, 
                    subject to applicable law.
The frequency with which information 
                    is accessed will vary with RCN's business needs.
==========
IV.
EXCEPTIONS 
RCN will consider personally identifiable information that 
                    is collected and kept about any person to be confidential 
                    and will disclose it to a third party only if (i) the discloser 
                    consents in advance in writing or electronically; (ii) disclosure 
                    is necessary to render the RCN services and to perform related 
                    business activities expressed in this privacy statement (See 
                    Section III); (iii) disclosure is required pursuant a request 
                    for specific customer information to comply with a Subpoena, 
                    Court Order, and/or other legal instrument, legal proceeding 
                    or relevant law, specifically as it pertains to the US Patriot 
                    Act; or (iv) there is an immediate, imminent threat to the 
                    safety of any person, RCN or the RCN Network.
Upon a customer's 
                    act of submitting such information to RCN, the customer acknowledges 
                    and agrees to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement 
                    and Policy, and the customer shall indemnify, defend and hold 
                    harmless RCN, its parent company, agents, employees and subsidiaries, 
                    from and against any and all claims, loss, damage, cost or 
                    expense (including attorney's fees) to the extent such claims 
                    directly arise as a result of actions taken by RCN pursuant 
                    to the provisions described under the within Privacy Statement 
                    and Policy.
==========
RCN will not sell or provide lists containing personally 
                    identifiable customer information to unaffiliated third parties 
                    in the normal operation of its business.
