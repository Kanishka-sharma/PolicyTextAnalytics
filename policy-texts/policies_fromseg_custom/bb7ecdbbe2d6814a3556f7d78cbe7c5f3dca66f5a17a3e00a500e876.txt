Privacy Practices for our Technology
WHAT DOES Between Digital DO?
==========
Between Digital runs a platform that allows our clients to buy or sell ad space on websites for online advertising.
Our clients are businesses engaged in Internet advertising — advertisers, publishers, ad networks or ad agencies.
Our clients buy and sell media by participating in online exchanges for ad space.
==========
Our technology powers this platform.
When ad space on a website is bought or sold, usually to an advertiser, ad agency or ad network by a publisher, the Between Digital technology, as an agent for its clients, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to the Internet user who visits that site.
Generally, an Internet user’s computer comes into contact with Between Digital when a user visits a website, or views an ad, powered by the Between Digital technology.
The ads sent by the Between Digital technology are sent from the domain opendsp.ru, sometimes through client domains that forward ads and ad requests to and from opendsp.ru.

What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website.
Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user returns to a website or goes to another website.
Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics.
This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, make the website easier to use, measure the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailor their website to better match a user’s interests and preferences.
