Belo Interactive, Inc. is a subsidiary 
        of Belo Corp. ("Belo Interactive").
Belo Interactive is committed to respecting your privacy rights when visiting

To protect your Personal 
        Information, Belo Interactive has created the guidelines outlined below.
Understanding that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, any changes 
        to this policy will be promptly posted on this page, with an updated "effective 
        date" posted at the end of this policy.
Information Collected
        While visiting any of the Belo Interactive web sites (collectively, the 
        "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally 
        identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with 
        the Site.
Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, 
        your name, phone number, street address and e-mail address.
On any page 
        that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what

        or enter you in the promotion you have requested, as well as respond to 
        your inquiry or comment.

What are Cookies?
A cookie is an element of data that a web site 
        can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system.
This 
        element of data is a piece of text, not a program.
==========
The Site can only access 
        the information from a cookie sent by the Site.
We cannot access other 
        cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein.
Additionally, we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information 
        about you through the use of a cookie.
The only way we would learn such 
        information is if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information 
        to us, for example, through a registration system, by entering a sweepstakes 
        or promotion, etc.
==========
Why does the Site use cookies?
Belo Interactive uses cookies to 
        track usage of the Site and further personalize your experience when you 
        are visiting the Site.
By tracking usage, we can best determine what features 
        of the Site best serve the users.
==========
What benefits do I receive from cookies?
Overall, the use of cookies 
        helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site.
The information 
        is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user.
Cookies also 
        allow you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time 
        you access the Site.
May I decline to accept a cookie?
You may decline to accept cookies 
        sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies.
==========
However, some portions of the Site may require registration in order to 
        access those areas.
In such cases, we ask that you register and provide 
        us with basic information on our registration page, or sign in if previously 
        registered.
Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered 
        user; and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access 
        our Site.
In addition, our registration system may require that you accept 
        the cookies from the Site in order to access that portion of the Site.
==========
We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads 
        on the Site.
Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third 
        parties (i.e. advertising agencies or advertising clients).
We do not 
        have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain; 
        please contact the advertiser for more information on these cookies.
Other 
        sites linked to the Site may also send cookies; however we do not control 
        such activities.
What happens with the information collected in a cookie?
The information 
        stored in a cookie is used to identify you to our server, to allow us 
        to personalize your experience on the Site, and to serve content and communications 
        that may be of interest to you.
==========
IP Addresses: Belo Interactive does log IP addresses, or the location 
        of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting 
        purposes and to determine site usage.
Use of Personal Information
        We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal Information 
        with third parties outside of Belo Corp. except as described in this Privacy 
        Policy.
We believe that we can enhance your experience on our Site with 
        the information you share with us.
We use Personal Information about you 
        to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze 
        Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize 
        the Site's content, layout, and services.
We may also use your Personal 
        Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact 
        you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, 
        to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have 
        collected or respond to your comments and suggestions.
==========
Belo Interactive may match specific and/or aggregated Personal Information 
        with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings 
        that interest you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts.
Belo 
        Interactive also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe 
        our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, 
        our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes.
For example, we 
        provide our advertisers with aggregate information about our users, such 
        as "2,000 people viewed your ad today."
==========
As part of your experience on our Site, you may receive communications 
        from us related to products and services that might interest you.
While 
        we believe these services will enhance your experience at our Site, you 
        will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, 
        either by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your 
        profile from our database.
We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third party 
        service providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies 
        and fulfillment services.
When you sign up for a service we offer on the 
        Site, we may be required to share Personal Information with that service 
        provider in order to provide the service.
These third party providers 
        are not permitted to retain or use Personal Information for any purpose 
        unrelated to providing the service.
Belo Interactive may also offer other services as a part of our Site (e.g., 
        car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, 
        contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties).
If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may 
        provide some of your Personal Information to third parties, such as service 
        providers and other parties assisting us in providing the service.
We 
        will not do so without telling you how we will use that information, and 
        you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these 
        services or features of the Site.
==========
We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when needed to comply 
        with the law or a legal process, cooperate with investigations of purported 
        unlawful activities, to identify persons violating the law, or in connection 
        with the sale of part or all of Belo Interactive's or its affiliate's 
        stock or assets.
Party Collecting 
        the Information
        This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information 
        that we collect from you.
To the extent that you disclose any information 
        to other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat 
        rooms, personal ads, or the like, through third party services or promotions 
        offered on or through the Site or through other web sites throughout the 
        Internet, different policies may apply and Belo Interactive shall not 
        be responsible for the use or dissemination of such information.
==========
Our Sites may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry 
        co-branded pages.
In addition, other sites may use the Site's or Belo 
        Interactive's name.
Since Belo Interactive does not control the privacy 
        policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and 
        policies, if any, of such third parties, and Belo Interactive shall not 
        be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information 
        by such parties.
==========
Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review 
        those parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information 
        to others.

        Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally 
        identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable 
        parental consent.

        have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable 
        parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as 
        quickly as is practical.
Opting-Out
        We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information 
        with us and any third party.

        Information in several ways.

        services on the Site, you can choose whether to share optional Personal 
        Information in connection with the feature or service.

If you receive 
        communications from us that you prefer not to receive, you may opt out 
        from receiving these communications, either by specifically indicating 
        this preference in a communication to us or by deleting your registration 
        profile from our database.
You may also "opt-out" altogether from providing Personal Information 
        to us by not registering on the Site and thereby not providing Personal 
        Information.
You may also choose at a later date to have your name removed 
        from our database.
==========

        however, do require registration in order to access or use these areas 
        and services.
