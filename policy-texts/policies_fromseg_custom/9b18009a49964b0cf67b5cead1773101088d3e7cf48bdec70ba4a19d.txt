This Site is operated by Pixlr and has been created to provide information about our company and 
    to provide photo-related services (including photo editing and photo sharing services) 
    and other services (collectively, the “Services”) to our 
    Site visitors (“you” and/or “your”).
This Privacy Policy sets forth Pixlr’s policy with respect to information including

Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:
            We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, 
            such as when you register for access to the Services, use certain Services, 
            contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys.

            We have business relationships with other websites, where those sites make our Services available,
            for example through a link or frame that will transfer you to our Site.
==========
Some information may be shared
            automatically in order to make the connection, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
In other cases,
            you may be prompted to provide registration information.
We request our partners to provide a link to or the URL (web address) of this Privacy Policy in these cases.
By providing us with Personal Data as described above, you are consenting to our use 
                    of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data and other data may be transferred from your current 
                    location to the offices and servers of Pixlr and the authorized third parties referred 
                    to herein located in the United States or elsewhere.
Other Information:



Non-Identifiable Data:
                    When you interact with Pixlr through the Site, we receive and store certain personally 
                    non-identifiable information.
Such information, which is collected passively using 
                    various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
Pixlr may store such information itself or such information may be included in 
                    databases owned and maintained by Pixlr affiliates, agents or service providers.
This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, 
                    for example, usage data for the Services, the types of filters and applications 
                    used by users of the Services, the number of images that are open on our Site, 
                    the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of 
                    our Site and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.
==========
It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies."
A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives 
                        to your browser when you access the Site.
Our cookies help provide additional 
                        functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.
For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to 
                        access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site.
In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission.
On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar.
Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.

Aggregated Personal Data:
                    In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, 
                    Pixlr often conducts research on its customer demographics, 
                    interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us.
This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, 
                    and Pixlr may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business 
                    partners.
This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
==========
Pixlr may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our 
                    services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
