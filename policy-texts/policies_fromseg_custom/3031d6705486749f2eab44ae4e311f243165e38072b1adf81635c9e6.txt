WAPT 
is a load, stress and performance testing tool for websites and web-based applications.

curve and give you an ability to create a heavy load from a regular workstation.

WAPT is able to generate up to 3000 simultaneously acting virtual users using standard hardware configuration.
Virtual users in each profile are fully customizable.
