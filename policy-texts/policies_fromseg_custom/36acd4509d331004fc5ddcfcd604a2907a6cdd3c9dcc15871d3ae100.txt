NFL.com Online Privacy Policy
The policies below are applicable to the above-named online service (the "Service") produced and maintained by NFL/Starwave Partners d/b/a ESPN Internet Ventures ("EIV") and our affiliate GO Network sites.
EIV collects personally identifying information only during (i) contest or sweepstakes Registration and (ii) subscription Registration for sites that require subscription and (iii) online shopping.
In addition, Registration is required and information is collected in certain portions of the Service in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting.
EIV may use such information to fulfill prizes, track compliance with our House Rules, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information).
In the event EIV plans to publicly post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting.
Policies for Individuals Under 13
EIV encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites.
No information should be submitted to or posted at NFL.com's Web sites by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.
Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, EIV does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.
==========
All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration.
In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration and providing instructions on how the parent could delete the Registration if so desired.
Although guests under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardian identified in the initial Registration process.
No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purpose whatsoever, either inside or outside EIV.
Guests' e-mail addresses are never posted on EIV Online Web sites.
To facilitate global registration within sites operated by EIV Online and its GO Network affiliates all Registration information is shared.
It is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable.
Policies for Individuals 13 Years of Age or Older: With the permission of a guest who is 13 years of age or older, information submitted at the time of Registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by EIV and may be shared with our Affiliates of GO Network or companies that have been pre-screened by EIV.
If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her Registration information online.
By registering with EIV, every effort will be made to maintain your information in a secure environment by EIV and our affiliates of GO Network.
==========

You can then modify your information or e-mail requests in the appropriate boxes.

==========
About IP Addresses EIV collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web.
Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
When guests request pages from EIV Online sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses.
We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.

==========

==========
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.
EIV Online does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the EIV Online cookie policy.
The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
==========
However, it is possible that some areas of the site, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.
Links to Other Sites Users should be aware that when you are on EIV Online sites you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.
There are links to other sites from EIV Online sites that take you outside our service.
For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" takes you off the EIV Online site.
This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use EIV Online's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.
These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.
Always be aware of where you end up.
