Special Rules Information Relating to Children

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we
inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose
personal information from children under 13 years of age.
LiveJournal
is not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize that
with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to
visit LiveJournal and use our Service.
COPPA requires that we obtain
the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years
of age to use certain features of LiveJournal.
When your child attempts to register and/or provide personal
information to LiveJournal, we require a parent or legal guardian
to:

complete the registration;
review our privacy policy and to submit a valid credit card number to
verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our
information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and
verify through the use of an email confirmation and second
authorization that the parent or guardian consents to the Terms of Service
and this privacy policy.
Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we
collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other
user of LiveJournal.
Without verified parental notice and consent,
we will not knowingly collect personal information relating to children under
13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such
information, we will promptly delete it.
How Parents can Access their Children's Personal Information
In compliance with COPPA, a parent or legal guardian may request from us
to review, delete or stop the collection of personally identifiable
information relating to their child or any child in their legal custody who is
under 13 years of age.

If you know the user name and password, follow the instructions below
regarding Changing your Preferences and Personal Information, or
you may contact us by letter, phone or email using the address information
provided at the bottom of this page.

or used, we will be required to terminate your child's ability to use any part
of the Service that requires a user to "sign in."
