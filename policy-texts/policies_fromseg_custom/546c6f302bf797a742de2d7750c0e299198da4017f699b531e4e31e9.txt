How we process personal data when we display advertising on behalf of companies and their brands (the advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space
What we do
Behavioural Advertising 
Our main business is to display advertising on behalf of companies and their brands (the advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space.
==========
The aim is to make the advertising you see relevant and useful to you.
This is known as “behavioural advertising”.
Re-targeting 
We also provide data driven re-targeting services.
==========
This means that we help our clients and advertisers to understand their customers buying habits online based on their previous activities on the internet.
Data Management 
We help our clients understand more about their customers’ interests, behaviour and how they interact with our clients’ brand online.
This helps our client to spot emerging trends.
==========
Can we identify you?
We make no attempt to identify you personally and we do not retain the information given to us by the advertiser; we use it as instructed by the advertisers who are under statutory obligations to ensure that you have been informed / have consented to this use as required by applicable law.
The cookies we use may allow us to recognise the device you are browsing from.
Therefore, when you visit a website on which we have placed an advert your browser will send us its IP address.
==========
We may then use publically available database to ascertain your approximate location (e.g. your city or district).
This information will then help us to determine what language the adverts should be in or whether you might be interested in receiving offers from shops and restaurants near your city or district.
There may also be times where we correlate and combine data that we receive from our advertisers and with our own data in order to ensure that the advertising that you receive is as relevant to you as possible.
