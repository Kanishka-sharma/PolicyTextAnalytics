HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Profiling Hybrid Theory may use data to create profiles of users’ interests, in addition to matching them to existing profiles or “segments”, which will allow us to target them with advertising that is useful to them later on.
As part of this, we collect Browsing Data and
Inferred Data from the sources listed above, which is typically related to a user’s web activity.
Analysing this data allows us to understand a user’s interests, and match them to “segmented profiles” or “model audiences” based around categories of hobbies or features common to a group of online web users.
This allows us to then show users who are interested in receiving targeted advertising a relevant advertisement that appeals to that particular group of users.
This is performed using an automated process using artificial intelligence (AI) developed and managed by our Data Engineering team.
The outputs are passed on to our third-party partners and used to target advertisements to the user groups we assign you to.
==========
As part of this process, we take steps to exclude any categories or labels related to Special Category Data or children’s data being used to collect or generate such profiles.
THIRD-PARTY MARKETING
We will collect your consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
==========
This will be achieved through the use of opt-in click or button functionalities through our website or requiring you to perform another affirmative action, such as replying to an email or text, to confirm your consent.
You can withdraw your consent at any time.”]
