Online Banking Security 

       Chase is serious about safeguarding your personal information 
          online.
As a security measure, you may access your account information online 
          from the Chase website only if you have registered with Chase Online.
Chase Online Banking uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your 
          personal information such as User Ids, Passwords, and account information over 
          the internet.
Any information provided to you is scrambled en route and decoded 
          once it reaches your browser.

Although the information below is not exhaustive, it contains some key points 
          that will help you use the internet in a more secure manner.
Use these points 
          with caution and good judgment.
==========
Submitting Forms Online 

       Information you provide via electronic forms on the Chase 
        website is secure and encrypted in most instances.
In other words, it is scrambled 
        en route and decoded once it reaches Chase.
==========
You may check that your web session 
        is secure by looking for a small lock symbol usually located in the lower corner 
        of your web browser window.
Current versions of leading web browsers indicate 
        when a web page is encrypted for transmission through this symbol.
You may also 
        look for the letters "https://" at the beginning of your website URL 
        in your web browser.
The "s" means that the web connection is secure.
==========
Sending E-mail to Chase 

       E-mail sent within the Chase.com website and Chase Online 
        is secure.
However, e-mail sent to us through other means may not be secure unless 
        we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting 
        the information.
Therefore, we ask that you do not send confidential information 
        such as social security or account numbers to us via an unsecured e-mail.
Such 
        communications should be sent to us via postal mail or you may call 1-800-CHASE24 
        or visit one of our branches.

Employee Conduct
	  The Chase Corporate Code of Conduct expresses our absolute 
            commitment to integrity, our related corporate values and ethical standards 
            and the associated business conduct we expect from all our employees.
The Code of Conduct includes very specific guidelines concerning the safeguarding 
            of confidential information, which includes customer information.
In general, 
            these guidelines limit employee access to confidential information, and 
            limit the use and disclosure of such information to specifically authorized 
            processes and transactions.
If it is determined that employees have violated 
            the Code of Conduct, corrective action may be taken, including immediate 
            dismissal.
Verification of Practices
Periodically, our operations and business practices 
            are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing 
            the confidentiality of information.
==========
These reviews are conducted by our 
            own internal staff, Chase auditors who report directly to the Chase Board 
            of Directors, external accounting and auditing firms and government regulators.
Included in these self-assessments and examinations are reviews of the 
            controls and safeguards related to consumer privacy which are described 
            in our Chase Privacy Notice and Chase Online 
                Consumer Information Practices.
Consumer Recourse

            policies concerning our usage of personally identifiable information that we 
            may collect over the Internet, or that information we have provided to you based 
            upon your Internet activity is inaccurate, you may Contact Us.
