HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION
The first thing to remember about privacy is that there is only so much information that any website can collect without your answering of specific questions.
==========
The Nest logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, and to examine overall traffic trends.
(For example, IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various online gateways, such as Yahoo! or America Online.)
This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes only.
IP addresses are not linked to any personal information.
==========
The Nest uses a cookie, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our site to your preferences.
For example, The Nest uses a cookie to identify you as a Nest member and to make sure that only you have access to, for example, your own personal wedding budget and calendar.
This way, you answer certain questions only once and not every time you participate in an activity or event.
The cookie by itself doesn't tell us, or anyone else, who you are, what your email address is, or anything else personal.
You provide that information when you register with The Nest, and only The Nest has access to that information.
If you choose set up your browser to reject all cookies, please understand that you may be limited to some the areas or functionality within our site.
For more information on cookies, please see our Cookie FAQ.

You can browse The Nest and read our editorial content without registering or providing any personal information.
However, in order to take advantage of our personalized services, you are required to provide us with information such as your name, email address, real-world address, wedding date, and role in the wedding.
We collect similar information from users who choose to participate in our contests and promotional events.
We always let you know before we collect any personal information from you.

WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information we collect from your membership helps us to improve our content, customize certain pages for you, and update you about The Nest.
From time to time, The Nest does share names, postal addresses, and demographic information with other pre-screened organizations that have specific direct mail product and service offers we think may be of interest to you.
You may choose at any time to remove your name and address from these mailing lists by editing your privacy preferences (see paragraph below) or by letting us know via email to membersupport@thenest.com (please include your name, address, and email).
