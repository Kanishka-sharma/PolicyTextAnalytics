DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
SourceForge.net is a website owned and operated by OSTG for the purpose of fostering software development and content creation under Open-Source Initiative ("OSI")-approved licenses or other arrangements relating to software and/or content development that may be approved by OSTG (the "Purpose").
OSTG currently offers users access to a rich collection of on-line resources for Open Source software development and content creation on SourceForge.net, including various communications tools, source code control and project management tools, online forums, personalized content, a donation system and branded programming (collectively, the "Services").
To use these SourceForge.net Services, each user must independently obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access Web-based content, and pay any and all service fees or equipment costs associated with such access.
4.
==========
REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
If required by OSTG, each user must: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information on the Service's registration form (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data as necessary.
If, after investigation, we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly provided herein.
Each user will receive a password and account designation upon completing SourceForge.net registration process and is wholly responsible for maintaining the confidentiality thereof and wholly liable for all activities occurring thereunder.
OSTG cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to comply with this Section, including any loss or damage arising from any user's failure to (a) immediately notify OSTG of any unauthorized use of his or her password or account or any other breach of security and (b) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end of each session.
SourceForge.net handles user Registration Data in accordance with the SourceForge.net Privacy Statement accessible at http://sourceforge.net/tos/privacy.php.
5.

CONTENT
All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or any other materials whatsoever (collectively, "Content"), whether publicly posted on or privately transmitted via SourceForge.net, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.
This means that the user, and not OSTG, is entirely responsible for all Content that he or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via SourceForge.net or any Service.
No user shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities on SourceForge.net and/or any Service which, in the judgment of OSTG, is likely to be prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the transmission of obscenity or the permissible uses of intellectual property.
OSTG will not pre-screen or review Content, but OSTG reserves the right to refuse or delete any Content of which it becomes aware that it reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose.
In addition, OSTG shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or delete any content that it reasonably considers to violate the Terms or be otherwise illegal.
==========
OSTG, in its sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful by us to protect the rights, property or personal safety of OSTG, SourceForge.net users and the public.
OSTG does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content.
Under no circumstances will OSTG be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via SourceForge.net or any Service thereon.
Each user, by using SourceForge.net or any Service, may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.
Each user must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
6.
==========
LICENSING AND OTHER TERMS APPLYING TO CODE AND OTHER CONTENT POSTED ON SOURCEFORGE.NET
Use, reproduction, modification, and other intellectual property rights to data stored in CVS or as a file release and posted by any user on SourceForge.net ("Source Code") shall be subject to the OSI-approved license applicable to such Source Code, or to such other licensing arrangements that may be approved by OSTG as applicable to such Source Code.
With respect to text or data entered into and stored by publicly-accessible site features such as message boards and bug trackers ("SourceForge.net Public Content"), the submitting user retains ownership of such SourceForge.net Public Content; with respect to publicly-available statistical content which is generated by the site to monitor and display project activity, such content is owned by OSTG.
In each such case, the submitting user grants OSTG the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, all subject to the terms of any applicable approved license.
With respect to Content posted to private areas of SourceForge.net, i.e., private SourceForge.net development tools or SourceForge.net Mail, the submitting user may grant to OSTG or other users such rights and licenses as the submitting user deems appropriate.
Content located on any SourceForge.net-hosted subdomain which is subject to the sole editorial control of the owner or licensee of such subdomain, shall be subject to the OSI-approved license applicable to such Source Code, or to such other licensing arrangements that may be approved by OSTG as applicable to such Content.

While OSTG will use reasonable efforts to back up site data and make such data available in the event of loss or deletion, OSTG has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any messages and other communications or other Content maintained or transmitted by any Service.
OSTG reserves the right to mark as "inactive" and archive SourceForge.net accounts and/or projects that are inactive for an extended period of time.

RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

Accordingly, you and OSTG agree that any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or our services ("Claims") shall be resolved in accordance with one of the subsections below or as otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties.
Amicable resolution.
Before resorting to the other alternatives below, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek an amicable resolution through dialog.

For any Claim (excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, you or OSTG may elect to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration conducted by telephone, on-line and/or based solely upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required.
If in-person appearance is required, it shall be held in Santa Clara County, California or another location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
In all such cases, the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or JAMS in accordance with their applicable rules, or any other established ADR provider mutually agreed upon by the parties.
==========
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Court.
Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California or where the defendant is located (in our case Fremont, California, and in your case your home address or principal place of business).
You and OSTG agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California.
==========
All Claims (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable relief) between the parties must be resolved using the dispute resolution mechanism that is selected in accordance with this Section by the first party to file a Claim.
Should either party file an action contrary to this Section 21, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $1000, provided that the party seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed Claim, and the other party has failed to withdraw the Claim.
