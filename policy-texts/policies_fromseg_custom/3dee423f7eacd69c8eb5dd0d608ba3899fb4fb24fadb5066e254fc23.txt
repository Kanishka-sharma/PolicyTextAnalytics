When you interact with Adelphic through the Site or Adelphic Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information (non-PII).
This data, which is collected passively using various technologies, does not identify you personally, and may come from such sources as your mobile web browser, or the apps that you use.
We use this Non-PII along with our technology to perform a variety of tasks, such as limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same mobile user (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of mobile users, or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked.

We may share this Non-PII with clients, vendors, and other companies that we conduct business with.
In operating this Site, we may use a technology called “cookies” which is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site.
Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.
In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission.

Non-Personal Information
Adelphic creates micro-audience segments to make advertising delivered to consumers more relevant.
The segments we create are used by us, our clients and partners, including advertisers and publishers, to deliver targeted advertising.
In the process of serving an advertisement to a consumer, we, or our partners, may decide to serve an ad based on the audience segment(s) that a particular customer is in, and/or other information we have about the user, app, or site the ad comes from.
The data we collect is also used for reporting purposes, to give our clients more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns, and to improve performance over time.
Consumers
Consumers that receive advertiser offers through the Adelphic platform are not covered by Adelphic’s privacy policy.
We may receive non-personally identifiable information from consumers through our platform but we only use such information to provide consumers the best and most relevant advertising.
==========
Children
We do not target children under the age of thirteen (13).
Children under the age of 13 may be placed into one of our general audience segments, based on the activity of the device/browser they are using.
We are unable to prevent this as we do not collect personally identifiable information and we don’t collect information with the intent of identifying users as being under the age of 13.
==========
Information Sharing
Adelphic Services are used by advertisers, publishers and other companies providing mobile advertising services.
We may share aggregated, non-personal information and audience segments with these clients to enable them to deliver targeted advertising.
We only share this information with authorized third parties and we require them to follow the same behavioral principles and practices we adhere to.
When you opt-out of our services, we stop sharing behavioral data with these third parties.
