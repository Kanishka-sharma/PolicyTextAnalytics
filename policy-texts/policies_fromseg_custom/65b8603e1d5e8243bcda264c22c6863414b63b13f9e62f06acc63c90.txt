ABOUT CAFEMOM 
CafeMom is an online service for moms that allows our mom members to set up unique personal profiles and, through those profiles, to create an online network of other moms.
CafeMom members ("Members") can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and make new friends on the Site, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests.
To enrich our Members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other Members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends.
CafeMom members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other Members and CafeMom communicates with them.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
When you Register.
When you register with CafeMom, you create your own profile and privacy settings.
Your profile information, as well as your screen name and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to allow you to connect with other CafeMom Members.
==========
Your real name is never displayed on the Site (unless you use it as your screen name), but your real name will be included in emails that you "send to a friend."
You can choose to allow Members to search for you by using your real name or most other information you have entered in your profile.
Please be aware that certain personal profile information is displayed for all Members and cannot be hidden.
Specifically, your screen name, photo, number of kids and the location entered on your profile are always displayed on the Site and therefore, are viewable by all users.
In addition, because this information is publicly displayed on the Site, it may appear in the results of searches conducted on Internet search engines while you are a Member of the Site and potentially for some time period after your membership is terminated, depending upon the search engine's indexing practices.

By using the search functionality on the Site, CafeMom Members can find other moms with similar interests and challenges.
When you find other Members, you can view their personal profiles to find out more about them based on the information they have decided to share on the Site.
Journals and Photos.
As a CafeMom Member, you can share personal content, such as journals and photos.
