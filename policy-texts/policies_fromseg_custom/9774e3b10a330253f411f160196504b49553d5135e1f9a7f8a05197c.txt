You may choose voluntarily to give us personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, or other information about yourself.
In addition, we may collect non-personal information automatically as you navigate our sites.

Completion of these forms is entirely voluntary but may be required in order to request certain services from Magento.
Resume submissions on our Sites are used to screen candidates and contact them for interviews.
Magento may also use our sites to periodically survey our Clients for purposes of improving the quality of our service and customer satisfaction.

Client participation is completely voluntary, and any information we collect from you as part of our surveys will be treated with the same respect as any other information gathered in accordance with this Notice.
how we collect it
Our Sites use web beacons and other technologies to collect information when you access our websites, and we may store that information in “cookies”.

how we use cookies and other technology
When you access our sites, we and our affiliates, business partners and vendors may place small data files on your computer or other device.
We use these data files, commonly known as “Cookies” to help us identify you as a site visitor or Client, customize our content and enhance your site experience.
==========
These third parties may also use a technology called “Tags” or “Web Beacons”.
Similar in function to Cookies, Web Beacons allow us to understand the movements of visitors to our Sites.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer our Sites, to track users' movements around the Sites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Magento has no access to or control over third party cookies or tracking technologies, but does not provide personal information through the use of web beacons and cookies to these parties.

However, disabling or limiting cookies may cause certain features of this site to not function properly.
Check your browser’s “Help” files or other similar resources to learn more about handling cookies on your browser.
==========
do not track
California law requires us to state how we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
Because there is currently no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT, we do not currently respond to DNT signals.
We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
