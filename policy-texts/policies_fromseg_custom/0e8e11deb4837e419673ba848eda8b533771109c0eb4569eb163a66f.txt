How We Use Your
Information
 
We may use the information that you provide to us, that we
collect from your device, and information we obtain from retailers, other third
parties and public sources: 
 
·      
to provide the Website, App and Service; 
·      
to determine the retailer(s) that may fulfill your order
request, where we should offer or focus services, features and/or resources,
and how to improve our offerings; 
·      
to determine demand for the Service in a particular
geographic market and to notify you when the Service becomes available in your
geographic location, unless you opt out from receiving such notice;
·      
to analyze our performance and evaluate strategies to
support and enhance your access and use of the Website, App and Service, in
part by monitoring which features of the Website, App and Service you and other
users access or use most, and to attribute the sources of our traffic; 
·      
to allow you to rate your purchases and view your purchase
history; and to suggest other products that you might like based on your
personalized profile;
·      
to recognize your device over time so we can customize the
Website and App to your interests and tastes based on your prior activities; 
·      
to obtain additional information about you from other third
parties claiming a right to share your data with us so we can associate that
information with information that we have collected so we may further customize
your user experience;
·      
to notify you about new services or special promotional
programs, or send you offers or information, and to measure the responsiveness
to such communications and to our other advertising efforts;

to enable you to take advantage of interactive features of
the Website and App; for example, sharing a product review or participating in
a rewards program;
·      
to administer sweepstakes and contests;
·      
to engage with you through social media, including through
direct messaging;
·      
to serve you the correct application version depending on
your device type;
·      
to diagnose and resolve problems with our Website, App or
servers and for other technical and administrative troubleshooting purposes;
·      
to send you service-related announcements relating to the
Website, App or Service; for instance, if our Website or App or the Service is
temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email notifying
you; generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not
promotional in nature; if you do not wish to receive them, you have the option
to deactivate your account;
·      
to provide customer service, such as to send you a welcoming
email to the address you provide at registration to verify your username and
password, communicate with you in response to your inquiries, provide the
services you request, and manage your account; and
·      
to investigate and address fraudulent transactions and
generally implement fraud prevention measures.
We use information obtained from retailers and third parties
claiming a right to disclose your information to us in accordance with our
agreements with them and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Aggregated Information; Non-Personal Information.
We may
aggregate your Personal and Non-Personal Information with other users’
information and gather broad demographic data about our users for many
purposes, including so that we can improve the Website, App and Service, and
for business and administrative purposes.
==========
Advertising.
Targeted or behavioral advertising
involves using information we collect about you, as described in this Privacy
Policy, to determine which advertisement should be displayed to you via the
Website or App.
For example, if you have shown a preference for a type of
beverage while using the Service, you may be served an advertisement via the
Website or App relating to that type of beverage.
We also connect such
information in order to link your activity on our Website to your activity on
our App, allowing us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless
of how you interact with us, online or through the App.
If you do not wish to have us use your information
for targeted advertising, you should cease using the Website, App and
Service.
==========
Our Disclosure
of Your Information
 
We share information collected from or about you only as
follows:
 
Aggregated and Anonymized Data.
Drizly may
share with or sell to third parties aggregated demographic information and
Non-Personal Information about our user base, including information on how
users interact with our App, Website, partners and advertisers for industry
analysis, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other
products and services.
We will only
do so after either removing from such information anything that personally
identifies you or combining it with other information so that it no longer
personally identifies you.
==========
Third-Party Advertising; Interest-Based and Cross-App
Advertising.
We may participate in third-party
advertising networks.
These
networks collect certain information (e.g., click stream information, browser
type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over,
hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) when you access and
interact with websites and apps of companies within their networks.
They use this information in combination
with other information that they may otherwise already have about you to serve
you ads for products and services of companies that are in the same advertising
network and that they predict will be relevant to your interests based on your
activities across various websites and apps.
For example, if you previously browsed a
particular product, you may see an ad for that very same product on another
site at a later time.
This type of
advertising is called re-targeting and is a form of interest-based or cross-app
advertising.
Third-party
advertising networks may also be able to use a combination of information to
identify you personally.
==========
Furthermore, the companies participating in a given
network may also be able to obtain similar information and associate the
information with your identity based on information they may already have about
you.
The networks and participating companies may use cookies and similar
technologies such as pixels, tags, beacons and other technologies to collect
information about you.
We also may allow other companies that advertise on our
Website and App to use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, tags,
beacons and other technologies to collect information about you, provided it is
not Personal Information.
Similarly, we may receive information about you as a result of ads we
place on other websites and apps through cookies and similar technologies such
as pixels, tags, beacons and other technologies.
When we collect information about you through third-party advertising
networks or other advertising, we use the information for the purposes
described in this Privacy Policy.
The
information practices of third-party advertising networks and their
participating companies and the information practices of our other advertisers
are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
A “do not track” feature lets you tell websites that you do
not want to have your online activities tracked.
At this time, we are not
configured to respond to browser “do not track” signals.
==========
For more information about online
advertising, including information on setting preferences for or opting out of
third-party advertising networks, please visit Network Advertising Initiative, Digital Advertising Alliance and Google Ad
Network.
If you choose to opt-out, you may still
be served ads, but the ads may not be relevant to your interests.
Furthermore, some of the features of the
Website and App may not be fully functional for you.
Third-Party Analytics.
We use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to
evaluate the performance of various features of our Website and App and also to
evaluate the overall performance of our Website and App.

advantage of certain features of our Website and App and/or making use of our
Website and App generally.

Website's and App’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Website, App
and Service are used.
These third parties are authorized to access and use your
Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf.
==========
Law Enforcement.
We will disclose information about

sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and

any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a
risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
Acquisition of Drizly.
In the event that all or a
substantial portion of the assets, business or stock of Drizly are acquired by,
merged with or transferred to another party, or in the event that Drizly goes

the assets that is transferred to or acquired by the third party.
You
acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Drizly or
its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this
Privacy Policy.

Security.
All information we collect is securely stored within our
database, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security
practices such as 128-bit encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers).
However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is
impenetrable.

guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being
transmitted to us over the Internet, and any information you transmit to Drizly
you do so at your own risk.
