Disclosure of Personal Information
Oculus occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as answering customer support inquiries, resolving service problems and correcting errors in the Service (including customer inquiries, billing, and credit corrections), to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service, and to enhance your experience on the Service.
Oculus will only provide these companies with those pieces of your personal information needed to deliver the Service, and the companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.
Oculus may share your personal information with third parties in order to fulfill a service or transaction you may have requested.
Oculus may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Oculus, including, without limitation, to respond to a subpoena, court order or such other request, or otherwise establish or exercise our rights; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Oculus and of the Content as licensed to Oculus,; (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service, or the public, or (d) if Oculus files for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets or ownership of Oculus.
Oculus assumes no obligation to inform you that your information has been provided and in some cases may be prohibited by law from giving such notice.
==========
Managing Your Personal Information
You can always add, update, or make other changes to the information in your account settings and/or user profile.
Sharing Your Personal Information
Any information that you may reveal in your user profile, in communication with any other users or in other online discussions or forums, is intentionally open to the public and is not in any way private.
You should think carefully before publicly disclosing any personally identifiable information.
What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.
==========
Security and Storage of Your Personal Information
Oculus uses reasonable precautions to keep user information secure.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
However, due to the open nature of communication through the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Service, and the Service and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.
Users of the Service do so at their own risk.
We cannot guarantee the security of any information disclosed online.
==========
Operational Information
Some “operational” information is used by the Services in order to operate your account properly and provide the Services.
This operational information does not include the personal information that you provide as part of your user profile, but may include, for example, the following: the date on which your profile was last updated, whether your e-mail address has been verified, whether your account has been deactivated, what browser you are using, the IP address of your computer or other networking device, and other similar types of information.
Operational information may be shared with third parties to the extent necessary to provide the Services.
==========
Aggregate Information
We may collect and analyze information about your use of the Services as aggregated with the use of the Services by other users (“Aggregate Information”); for example, overall usage patterns of Users, the total number of Users, the percentage of Users who are female, or in a certain age range, or who live in a particular region, etc., or the percentage of Users who are also consumers of various other products and services.
The collection and analysis of Aggregate Information is important in the operation and enhancement of the Services and other business purposes.
Aggregate Information may be compiled in reports and disclosed, sold, licensed or rented to third parties.
However, since Aggregate Information does not include any information that can be used to individually identify you or any other User, it is not possible for the third party recipient of the Aggregate Information to use it to identify or contact you.
==========
Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technology
A cookie is a very small text file that a Web site saves to your computer’s hard disk to store information that you provide about yourself or to store your preferences.
Oculus may place Internet cookies on your hard drive.
Cookies are used to store your profile information on your hard disk.
The cookie allows you to move from page to page at the Oculus Websites without having to sign in again on each page.
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies using the settings on your browser.
However, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use the Services.
==========
As part of the Services, we may recommend for your consideration various content, products and services.
Accordingly, we may analyze data pertaining to your online transactions, purchase history, application usage patterns and usage patterns on the Oculus Websites through utilizing a tracking pixel, beacon, agent or any other visitor identification technology that collects anonymous data about end users of the Oculus Websites and the Services so that we can make recommendations suited especially to you or to target certain advertising or promotional offers to you.
Third-Party Websites
The Oculus Websites and Services regularly interact with third party sites, services and applications.
Third-party sites, services and applications accessible through the Oculus Websites have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us.
Oculus has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.
If you provide any information to such third parties, different rules regarding the collection and use of your personal information may apply.
We strongly suggest that you review such third-party’s privacy policies before providing any data to them.
Reasonable Efforts
We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with this Policy.
==========
We sometimes release beta versions of our products and services, which are further refined before the release of the final version.
Because these products and services are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so.
As such, we welcome User feedback on any privacy concerns you may have.
In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and ­business, and the security risks associated with using the Internet, we do not guarantee error-free performance under this Policy.
TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, OCULUS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS POLICY, INCLUDING FOR ANY SECURITY BREACH THAT COMPROMISES ANY USER’S PERSONAL INFORMATION AS IT RELATES TO OCULUS’ WEBSITEs, SERVERS OR SOFTWARE.
