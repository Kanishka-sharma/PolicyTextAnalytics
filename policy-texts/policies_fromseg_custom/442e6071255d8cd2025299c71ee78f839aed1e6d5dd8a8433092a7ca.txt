Axonix services and commercial activities
Axonix operates a mobile advertising exchange.
When you use a mobile app or browse a website on your mobile device, that app or website will often contain ads.
Our service enables organisations that represent advertisers to automatically bid for the opportunity to show you an advertisement, in real-time (sometimes known as “programmatic” advertising due to the fact that it is largely automated).
As part of this auction process, some of your personal data is processed by us, albeit some of it in pseudonymised form.
Pseudonymisation means that, instead of identifying you by your name, unique identifiers are used instead, usually represented by a string of letters and numbers.
==========
Your information is collected to provide you with a more relevant, tailored online advertising experience and advertisers with the ability to reach individuals that are likely to be interested in their goods and services.
For more information on programmatic advertising, please click here
Axonix collects and processes your personal data (i) with your consent, (ii) to comply with law, and (iii) when it is in Axonix’s legitimate interests to do so.
Consent – In some circumstances, you will have been asked for your consent when you download a mobile app or access a mobile website.
This consent should include the right for the publisher to share your personal data with companies like ours so that advertising can be delivered.
Where you provide your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
==========
Please email us at privacy@axonix.com with your request.
Please note that if you reset your advertising ID on your device (which you can do via your settings on your mobile device), you may need to contact us to renew the opt-out.
==========
Legitimate Interests – where Axonix believes it has a legitimate interest in processing your personal data, this interest must be balanced against your rights and freedoms.
We may process using legitimate interests in the following circumstances: for direct marketing; fraud prevention; network and IT systems security; identifying and reporting criminal activity; and billing our clients and dealing with any billing disputes.
==========
Your rights 
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:

Request access to your personal data.
Request correction of your personal data.
Request erasure of your personal data.
Object to processing of your personal data.
Request restriction of processing your personal data.
Request transfer of your personal data.
Right to withdraw consent.
==========
Types of personal data we collect
We receive personal data from companies that provide ad technology services to app and website owners.
For more information relating to how specific app or website owners collect and use your personal data, please refer to the privacy policy for that app or website.
The types of personal data we collect and process about you may include:

A unique advertising identifier (IDFA for Apple devices, AAID for Android devices);
Location data, including lat/long;
IP address;
Make and model of your device;
Post code
Year of birth


Information about your interests, derived from your browsing history, app use and from data you have provided to website or app owners.
We will never receive your name, address, phone number or email address.
We do not collect sensitive personal data from you (which includes things like race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious or political belief) but you should be aware that this information could be inferred from the type of app you are using.
We recommend that you check the privacy policy of the app you are using for what information they collect and process about you if you are concerned about this.
==========
How we collect your personal data
Our technology platform is connected to multiple similar platforms that enable the real-time digital advertising auctions to take place.
We receive your personal data via a secure internet connection from app and website owner (sometimes called “publishers”), either directly, or, more commonly, through a company that aggregates bid requests on behalf of multiple publishers (often known as an SSP, or “supply side platform”).
How we use your personal data
We use the data we receive about you from apps and websites to deliver advertising to you when you are using a mobile app or browsing the internet on your mobile device.
The personal data that is included in a request for advertising that we receive (a “bid request”) will help to personalise the advertising you receive so that it is more relevant to you.
The data is also used to ensure that you receive advertising in your language and that the device you are using is able to display the advertising content.
In most circumstances, we pass the information that we receive in a bid request unaltered to partners in the advertising ecosystem, via a secure internet connection, to allow them to assess whether they wish to bid.
==========
This happens in a matter of milliseconds, and automatically, using the technology platform that we use – none of our employees is manually processing the information.
The personal data is not stored on our servers once the auction process has concluded.
Please see below for more information on data storage and how long we retain personal data for.
Do we share you personal data with anyone?
==========
As described above, the Axonix platform is connected to numerous other advertising technology platforms.
We send the bid requests that we receive to several “demand side” partners (or “DSPs”) to allow them to bid on the advertising inventory.
==========
We have written contracts in place with all of the DSPs that we deal with.
These contracts contain detailed obligations relating to the handling of personal data, including clauses stating that the DSP may only use your personal data in order to deliver advertising to you.
The DSPs that we share your information with may have other information about you that they have received from other sources.
You should always check the privacy policy for any apps and websites that you may use to see what information they collect and how it is used.
DSPs may also use the information we share with them about you (sometimes along with information they independently hold) to infer your interests and provide you with advertising that is more relevant to you.
Where do we store your personal data and for how long?
==========
Programmatic advertising auctions usually take place in less than a second.
Our software is hosted on Amazon cloud infrastructure in both the EU and the U.S. All of the bid request traffic we receive from SSP partners is directed to our EU infrastructure.
Some of our DSPs (to which we transmit bid requests) also have EU based infrastructure but others are in the U.S. so we may transmit your data to a country outside of Europe.
For more information on Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure – https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/
We do not retain any personal data from bid requests once the auction for that bid request has concluded.
All personal data is merely transmitted to DSPs for the purposes of the auction and not stored by Axonix once the auction has concluded.
Axonix has no need to retain your personal data beyond the end of an auction.
==========
Axonix has technical and organisational measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, alteration, unauthorised access or theft of any of your Personal Information.
We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the information stored in our platform.
==========

We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
==========

If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
