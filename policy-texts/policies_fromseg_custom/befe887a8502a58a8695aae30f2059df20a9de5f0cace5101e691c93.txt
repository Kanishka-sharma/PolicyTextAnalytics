Privacy Policy
Effective as of December 3, 2008 (the "Effective Date")
Your privacy is very important to us.
XE.COM INC. ("XE") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.
This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") explains what information we collect about you and what we do with it and applies to all products and services offered by XE.
We want you to fully understand our privacy practices and therefore, in addition to this Policy, we have created a Privacy Officer whom you can contact with any questions or concerns (see below).
We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and we will notify you of any material changes to the Policy by posting the modified Policy at http://www.xe.com/privacy.php and changing the Effective Date at the top.
We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.
==========
This Policy is incorporated into, and subject to, the terms of XE's Terms of Use.
By using or navigating XE's web site located at http://www.xe.com/ or any product or service offered by XE (collectively, the "Services"), you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Policy or any modified Policy as posted.
If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use or visit the Services.
==========
What information do we collect?
We do not collect personally identifiable information except where you specifically provide us with such information.
We may collect your full name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number, and other contact information.
We may also collect credit card information from you.
We generally collect this personal information on our registration and order forms when you sign up to receive products or services through our Services.
We collect aggregate technical information (such as IP addresses, screen resolution, browser language, etc.) and anonymous demographic information (such as your postal or zip code, the web site that you came from, etc.) during your usage of the Services.
What do we do with the information we collect?
We use personal information and other demographic or profile information you provide to us to fulfill your orders or requests, to attempt to prevent fraudulent transactions, to improve the content of our web page in order to enhance your experience, and to contact you when necessary.
Whenever possible, we use non-identifiable information (i.e. IP addresses and anonymous demographic information) rather than personal information.
Non-identifiable information is used to tailor your experiences with our Services by showing content in which we think you will be interested and displaying content according to your preferences.
==========
We may use aggregate data to analyze user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various portions and areas of our Services.
We also use the information collected to evaluate and improve our services and analyze traffic to our Services.
Personal information collected through Services is stored and processed in Canada and by using our Services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
==========
It is important for you to note that the laws on holding data in Canada may be less stringent than the laws of your country, but XE intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Policy.
Do we share the information we collect with third parties?
XE may share your information with our agents, processors, or contractors in order to fulfil your purchase order.
We may also transfer information between XE affiliates and our related companies.
You should note, however, that XE is opposed to spam mail activities and does not participate in such mailings, nor do we release or authorize the use of membership data for such purposes.
==========
We may use statistical analysis of aggregate information to inform advertisers of aggregate user demographics and behaviour, as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners.
We will provide only aggregate data from these analyses to third parties.
Advertisements that appear in the Services are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to you by third party advertisers, and they automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer or use other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.
==========
Third party advertisers have no access to the information you have provided to XE unless you choose to share it with them.
We may share information we collect with third party service providers to manage certain aspects of the services we provide, such as maintaining our servers and processing or fulfilling orders for products and services you purchase through the Services.
We ensure that the third party service providers that we share your information with have privacy policies in place substantially similar to our own.
We may also disclose your information in special cases if required to do so by law, court order or other governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interfering with, the rights or property of XE, the Services, another user, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities (e.g. for identify theft or fraud).
==========
How long do we retain information?
We retain personal information for such period of time as we feel is necessary to ensure that you have a reasonable opportunity to access the information.
If you no longer consent to us retaining your personal information, you can request that it be removed by contacting us at: as outlined at: http://www.xe.com/contact.php
Do we save any correspondence that you send to us?
Yes.
==========
If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we may retain such information in the records of your account.
We may also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from XE to you.
We may retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violation of XE's Terms of Use.
We may, over time, delete these records.
Is the information submitted in public forums confidential?
No.
==========
The Services may offer chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups to our users.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ANY INFORMATION DISCLOSED IN THESE AREAS BECOMES PUBLIC INFORMATION.
Accordingly, you should exercise extreme caution when deciding to disclose your personal information and you do so at your own risk.
==========
Do we use cookies?
Yes.
"Cookies" are pieces of information (actually, alphanumeric identifiers) generated by web servers and stored in your computer for future access.
Cookies cannot view or retrieve data from other cookies, nor can they capture files or data stored on your computer.
==========
We and our partners use cookie technology to enhance your online experience by making it easier for you to navigate through our Services or make a feature work better.

If you would like to use the Services, you may do so without accepting cookies.
However, you should understand that if you choose not to accept cookies, some areas of the Services may not function properly or optimally and you will not be permitted to access certain secured areas of the Services.
==========
Do we use web beacons?
No, we do not use web beacons.
Is the website secure?
Yes, the portions of our website (and our other Services) that handle sensitive confidential information are secure.
==========
We are committed to maintaining the security of your information and have measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
We employ the latest and most secure techniques available for protecting our systems from intrusion by unauthorized individuals, and we are constantly upgrading our security as better methods become available.
Our data center utilizes state-of-the-art physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the facility.
In addition, all information is stored in a secure location behind firewalls and other sophisticated security systems with limited (need-to-know) administrative access.
All XE employees who have access to, or are associated with, the processing of personal information are contractually obligated to respect the confidentiality of your information and abide by the privacy standards we have established.
==========
Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot (and do not) guarantee the absolute security of personal information.
Does this Policy apply to linked websites other than available through the Services?
No.
==========
The Services contain links to other Internet websites.
By clicking on a third party advertising banner or other link, you will be redirected out of the Services and to such third party websites.
Furthermore, we may permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through our Services.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies of such websites.
You should make sure that you read and understand the privacy policies of the third party websites and direct any concerns regarding external links to the third party website administrator or webmaster prior to providing any personally identifiable information.
