Zomato provides online ordering services by entering into contractual 
                                arrangements with restaurant partners (“Restaurant Partners”) 
                                and Stores (as defined below) on a principal-to-principal basis for the purpose 
                                of listing their menu items or the Products (as defined below) for online ordering 
                                by the Users on the Zomato Platform.
The Users can access the  menu items or Products listed on the Zomato Platform and 
                                place online orders against the Restaurant Partner(s)/Store(s) through Zomato.
Your request to order food and beverages or Products from a Restaurant Partner or a 
                                Store on the Restaurant Partner/Store page on the Zomato Platform shall constitute 
                                an unconditional and irrevocable authorization issued in favour of Zomato to place 
                                online orders for food and beverages or Products against the Restaurant 
                                Partner(s)/Store(s) on your behalf.
Delivery of an order placed by you through the Zomato Platform may either be undertaken 
                                directly by the Restaurant Partner or the Store against whom you have placed an order, 
                                or facilitated by Zomato through third-party who may be available to provide delivery 
                                services to you (“Delivery Partners”).
In both these cases, Zomato is 
                                merely acting as an intermediary between you and the Delivery Partners, 
                                or you and the Restaurant Partner or the Store, as the case may be.
The acceptance by a Delivery Partner of undertaking delivery of your order shall 
                                constitute a contract of service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 or any 
                                successor legislations, between you and the Delivery Partner, to which Zomato 
                                is not a party under any applicable law.
==========
It is clarified that Zomato does not 
                                provide any delivery or logistics services and only enables the delivery of 
                                food and beverages or Products ordered by the Users through the Zomato Platform 
                                by connecting the Users with the Delivery Partners or the Restaurant Partners 
                                or the Store, as the case may be.
Where Zomato is facilitating delivery of an order placed by you, Zomato shall not 
                                be liable for any acts or omissions on part of the Delivery Partner including 
                                deficiency in service, wrong delivery of order, time taken to deliver the order, 
                                order package tampering, etc.
You may be charged a delivery fee for delivery of your order by the Delivery Partner 
                                or the Restaurant Partner or the Store, as the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant 
                                Partner or the Store may determine (“Delivery Charges").
You agree 
                                that Zomato is authorized to collect, on behalf of the Restaurant Partner or the 
                                Delivery Partner or the Store, the Delivery Charges for the delivery service provided 
                                by the Restaurant Partner or the Store or the Delivery Partner, as the case may be.
The Delivery Charges may vary from order to order, which may be determined on 
                                multiple factors which shall include but not be limited to Restaurant 
                                Partner / Store, order value, distance, time of the day.
Zomato will use 
                                reasonable efforts to inform you of the Delivery Charges that may apply to you, 
                                provided you will be responsible for Delivery Charges incurred for your order 
                                regardless of your awareness of such Delivery Charges.
In addition to the Delivery Charges, you may also be charged an amount towards
                                delivery surge for delivery of your order by the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant
                                Partner or the Store, as the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant Partner or the Store
                                may determine on the basis of various factors including but not limited to distance
                                covered, time taken, demand for delivery, real time analysis of traffic and weather
                                conditions, seasonal peaks or such other parameters as may be determined from time to time
                                (“Delivery Surge").
==========
You agree that Zomato is authorized to collect,
                                on behalf of the Restaurant Partner or the Delivery Partner or the Store,
                                the Delivery Surge  for the delivery service provided by the Restaurant Partner
                                or the Store or the Delivery Partner, as the case may be.
The Delivery Surge may
                                vary from order to order, which may be determined on multiple factors which shall
                                include but not be limited to Restaurant Partner / Store, order value, distance,
                                demand during peak hours.
Zomato will use reasonable efforts to inform you of the
                                Delivery Surge that may apply to you, provided you will be responsible for Delivery
                                Surge incurred for your order regardless of your awareness of such Delivery Surge.

Online Ordering with Restaurant Partners:

All prices listed on the Zomato Platform are provided by the Restaurant 
                                    Partner at the time of publication on the Zomato Platform and have been 
                                    placed as received from the Restaurant Partner.
While we take great care 
                                    to keep them up to date, the final price charged to you by the Restaurant 
                                    Partner may change at the time of delivery.
In the event of a conflict 
                                    between price on the Zomato Platform and price charged by the Restaurant 
                                    Partner, the price charged by the Restaurant Partner shall be deemed to 
                                    be the correct price except Delivery Charge of Zomato.

For the purpose of clarity, 
                                    Pickup (in India)/Takeaway (in all other jurisdictions) would mean where a 
                                    Restaurant Partner has agreed to provide an option to the Users to collect 
                                    the Order themselves from the Restaurant Partner on which such an Order is 
                                    placed.
Zomato accepts no liability associated with food preparation by the 
                                    Restaurant Partner accepting the Order, and all food preparation and hand 
                                    over through Takeaway are the sole responsibility of the Restaurant
