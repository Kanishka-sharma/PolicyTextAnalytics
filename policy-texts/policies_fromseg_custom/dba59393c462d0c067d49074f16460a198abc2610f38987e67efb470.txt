THEMES
1) Cookies and other similar technologies
Cookies and other similar technologies used by Sirdata are text files placed on the User’s Browser and manipulated via an identifier in the form 20171120_XXXX6b25e5164555f79bbb95865XXXX, which means the User cannot be identified directly.
The Cookies and other similar technologies enable Sirdata identifying the Internet Browser of the Device in which they are saved, during their period of validity, to save and collect mainly the User’s browsing and interaction Data.
These Cookies and other similar technologies integrate broad categories of information on the User such as the age range and/or the interests.
They are used to improve Users’ browsing experience, for example by offering advertisements that are more appealing because they are based on their preferences.
==========
2) Hash of email
Sirdata never collects the User’s email address in plain text (i.e. in the form john.doe@sirdata.com) but collects only the transformed email address using hash functions.
This technique converts an email address in a character string in the form c52c40bb75bc6b3209cffac354d81b7a, enabling the pseudonymization of the information and creating simply a technical key associated with the User’s Cookie.
This mechanism is deemed one-sided.
Once the email address is converted in hash, it is no longer possible to retrieve the source email address based on the character string.
The User’s direct identification is therefore impossible.
.
Sirdata does not process any email address that hasn’t been converted in hash in its systems.
.
==========
3) Audience segments
An audience segment means a set of Users, segmented by Sirdata in a pseudonymous manner and according to demographic, interest and/or intent criteria.
This segmentation is based on the analysis of Users’ Data, and more particularly their browsing behaviours on the Sites they visit.
Distributing these audience segments to Customers and Partners, Sirdata allows its Customers and/or Partners’ customers to reach Users with personalised contents and offers.
4) Modelled Audiences
A modelled audience means a set of Users, created by Sirdata or its Partner(s) in a pseudonymous manner and according to demographic, interest and/or intent criteria.
Based on the behaviour pattern of Users whose demographic criteria, areas of interest or probable intentions have been determined, Sirdata or its Partner(s) can define browsing models to uncover other Users with similar demographic criteria, areas of interest or probable intentions.
This results in Modelled Audiences that allow Customers and/or Partners’ customers to reach Users with personalised contents and offers.
==========
5) Examples of Data uses and purposesTargeted advertisement
Sirdata uncovers the User’s intent to change, based on their browsing behaviors.
Thanks to their Cookie Identifier, the User, when browsing later on, will be shown advertisement for subscription packages, in line with their needs.
Site personalisation
Sirdata uncovers User’s interest for football practice, based on their browsing behavior.
Thanks to their Cookie Identifier, Sirdata’s Customer, a web merchant, can offer the User suitable sports articles when visiting its website without need for the User to carry out a search.
Customer database enrichment
Sirdata uncovers User’s intent for travelling to Hawaï.
Thanks to the reconciliation of their hash of email, Sirdata’s Customer, a retail banking business, can offer the User – only if the latter is already in its database and has provided their email address – a personalised insurance package for travelling abroad at the right time.
6) Sirdata’s Partners
Within the framework of its activities, Sirdata connects to partner technological platforms (Demand Side Platforms, Data Management Platforms, personalisation platforms…)
Sirdata transfers to them Users’ Data for it to be utilised by its Customers or by its Partners’ customers (advertisers, media agencies…).

7) Transfer of Data
The Data we collect may be transferred to countries that are not part of the European Union, in accordance with our Confidentiality Policy.
These Data may be transferred to companies within the Sirdata Group but also to our Sites Operators, Partners, Customers and Subcontractors.
We are aware that personal data protection and privacy standards in countries that are not members of the European Union are different.
Since we are likely, in relation to our business, to transfer Data from European residents outside the European Union, we require all our Sites Operators, Partners, Customers and Subcontractors to provide an adequate level of protection, in line with that required within the European Union, failing which, no data will be transferred to them.
As we are committed to providing protection for Users’ Data and compliance with European regulations, an adequate level of protection for Data means that our Sites Operators, Partners, Customers and Subcontractors formally undertake to comply with data protection standards such as compliance with:

– the EU-US Privacy Shield;
– the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission;
– Binding Corporate Rules (BCR).
8) Data Security
We implement all the necessary security measures to protect Sirdata and Users from any unauthorised access, damage, disclosure or destruction of the Data we have gathered.
We therefore use:
– effective technologies, such as encryption, using SSL technology and hashing/encryption; finally, we have installed firewalls on all our networks to prevent any intrusion from malicious third parties;
– internal audits on data collection, storage and processing are carried out regularly in order to check access to our databases and prevent any unauthorised system from accessing Sirdata systems;
– restricted access to the Data collected, so that only Sirdata Group employees whose role requires them to view the Data are authorised to access them, in accordance with strict confidentiality obligations to which they are subject, on penalty of proportionate and appropriate disciplinary sanctions.
==========
9) Location
Sirdata may collect Data relating to the User’s location through Cookies and other similar technologies.
Sirdata may be able to deduce the User’s approximate location such as the country or city based on their IP address, although depending on their method of connecting to the internet and Internet Service Provider (ISP), the IP address assigned to their Device may change each time they connect.
The collection of IP addresses is only used to locate the User geographically and is nomore precise than the country from which they are connecting.
We do not perform any geolocation and do not collect the GPS position of the User.
It is also possible for Sirdata to obtain the zip code of the User based on the information communicated by the latter, when browsing the Site of one of our Sites Operators and in particular, if they have an account where this information has been completed.
This Data can be shared to our Customers, Partners and Partners’ customers for the purposes of presenting the User with relevant marketing operation (for example to offer the User situated in the United Kingdom advertisement in English language, or to communicate the User living in the south of London an offer for a local shop).
