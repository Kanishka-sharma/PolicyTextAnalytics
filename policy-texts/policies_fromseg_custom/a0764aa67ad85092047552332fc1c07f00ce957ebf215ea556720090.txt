Such Personal Information may be collected, for example, when you submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Platform, send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit information to us via our Platform.
In addition to collecting Personal Information from users such as names and contact details, we also collect Non-Personal Information.

Such Personal Information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.
You may also be able to send an online card to a friend or family member, or send them a gift or gift certificate.

Other Information We Collect
Cookies
We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.
Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer’s hard drive for record keeping purposes.
Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase.
==========
They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and password.
A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Sites to other information about you.
These purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites.
==========
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the internet industry.
We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Policy.
Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.
Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.
However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of our Web Site.
==========
Clear GIFs
We may use “clear GIFs” (a/k/a “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on our Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.
A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.
A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you.
==========
IP Address and Clickstream Data
Pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site registrations, is collected through various methods.
For example, our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us.
This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet.
When you request pages from our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.
Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Web Site; the web site you visit after our Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers.
Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.
Device Information
We may collect certain device information.
Device information may include, for example: the type of device you are using (e.g., your particular brand of phone or tablet), certain device identifiers which may be unique to your device, your Internet service provider, and depending on your permissions, content you have stored on your device (e.g. contacts stored on your phone).
==========
Please note that we treat the information in section 2.2 as Non-Personal Information, except when we are required to do otherwise under applicable law or if we link this Non-Personal Information with your Personal Information.
How is the Personal Information Used?
We use both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for multiple purposes.
Digital First Media may use Personal Information for various purposes, including without limitation, to:
