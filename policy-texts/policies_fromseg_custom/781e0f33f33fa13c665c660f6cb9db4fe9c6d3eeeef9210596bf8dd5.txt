Right to Opt-Out
You have the right to direct Kochava to not sell your personal information to third parties at any time.
This is referred to as your “right to opt-out.”
Kochava only shares information as outlined herein.
If you choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information, Kochava will no longer send your personal information to third parties.
You can choose, at any time, to opt back in to the sale of your personal information.
==========
To opt-out of (or opt back in to) the sharing of your personal information with third parties, please submit at opt-out request to privacy@kochava.com.
Once you exercise your right to opt-out, Kochava will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize the sale of your personal information.
To exercise your right to opt-out, please submit a verifiable consumer request to Kochava by either (a) calling 855.562.4282, or (b) emailing privacy@kochava.com.
For more information on how to opt-out of interest-based advertising in general, visit https://www.kochava.com/opt-out/.
==========
Right to Know
You have the right to receive information about the types of personal information that Kochava collects, uses, discloses, and sells.
Specifically, this right allows you to ask Kochava for the following information: (a) the categories of personal information that Kochava collects about you; (b) the categories of sources from which Kochava has obtained personal information about you; (c) Kochava’s business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; (d) the categories of your personal information that Kochava sells to third parties; (e) the categories of third parties that Kochava sells your personal information to; and (f) the specific pieces of personal information that Kochava has collected about you.
Kochava must disclose this information to you when you exercise your right to know, subject to proper verification of your request.
If Kochava has shared your personal information for, both, business and commercial purposes, Kochava will provide you two separate lists: (a) one that identifies disclosures for business purposes and the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained; and (b) one that identifies sales and the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased.
Right to Access
In addition to your right to know about your personal information, as listed above, you have the right to request access to all the categories of personal information that Kochava has collected about you, and all the specific pieces of personal information that Kochava has collected about you.
==========
When you exercise this right, the information that Kochava provides to you must be in a portable and readily readable format.
Right to be Forgotten
You have the right to request that Kochava delete any personal information it has collected about you, subject to certain exceptions for business purposes.
Once Kochava receives and confirms your verifiable consumer request, Kochava will delete your personal information from its records, unless an exception applies.
Kochava may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for Kochava or its service providers to:

Complete the transaction for which Kochava collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
==========
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code § 1546 et.
seq.).
==========
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with Kochava.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
==========
Exercising your Rights to Know, Access, and be Forgotten
To exercise your rights to know, access, and be forgotten described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to Kochava by either:
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know or for access twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows Kochava to reasonably verify you are (a) the person about whom Kochava collected personal information or (b) such person’s authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows Kochava to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Kochava cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if Kochava cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with Kochava.
Kochava will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
Kochava endeavors to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.
If Kochava requires more time (up to 90 days), it will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
==========
Kochava will deliver its written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures Kochava provides will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.
The response Kochava provides will also explain the reasons it cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data access requests, Kochava will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
Kochava does not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If Kochava determines that the request warrants a fee, Kochava will tell you why it made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
==========
Right to Non-Discrimination
You have the right to non-discrimination if you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA.
If you exercise your rights under the CCPA, Kochava will not do any of the following: (a) deny you any goods or services; (b) charge you a different price or rate for Kochava’s goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; (c) provide to you a different level or quality of goods or services; or (d) suggest to you that you will receive a different price or rate for Kochava’s goods or services or a different level or quality of Kochava’s goods or services.
However, Kochava may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive Kochava offers will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
==========

Kochava reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at its discretion at any time.
Kochava will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page.
