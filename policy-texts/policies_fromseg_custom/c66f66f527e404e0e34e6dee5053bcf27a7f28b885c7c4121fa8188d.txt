We work with a number of suppliers and partners to process your personal data for the purposes described above.
Where these suppliers and partners act on our behalf they must only process your personal data in accordance with our instructions.
==========
The categories of suppliers and partners that we use include:


Engineer services firms


Couriers (who may also process your contact data as a data controller when arranging or communicating with you about your delivery);


Payment service providers (including Worldpay, who processes data as a data controller and whose privacy notice can be found here)


IT and information technology and services companies


Customer service centres


Debt Collection agencies


Other Sky Group companies (Information can be found here); and other companies in the Comcast group.
This includes:


Comcast, with whom we share data in relation to the development,
operation, infrastructure and performance of our products and
services


NBCU companies, such as Peacock), with whom we may share data showing
how many customers have watched NBCU or Peacock content on Sky.
Credit reference agencies (see further below);


Data Ireland, to validate the addresses we hold for our customers who
live in the Republic of Ireland;


Warranty companies (see further below); 


Data brokers.
==========
This includes Experian who we use to match Sky’s own data with data provided by brands in order to identify households to target for specific advertising campaigns (for example, using AdSmart).
For example, this data matching process could be performed on behalf of a supermarket that wants to target its television advertising to its existing customers who live near one of its stores.
The brand will receive back a report showing how successful the advertising campaign was (e.g. how many times their adverts were viewed), but will not receive information or data about specific households that have seen their adverts;



Nectar, in order for Nectar to send information about Sky offers to
their customers where their permissions allow and for Sky to
understand which households have taken up those offers; and


Marketing companies that deliver our communications.
Sometimes we share personal data with  suppliers and business partners who may process it outside of the European Economic Area.
==========
(for example, we use customer service centres in India and some IT services in USA).
Most of the time the data we share will be with companies who supply services to us to enable us to supply our services to you.
==========
We grant these companies access to personal data only where necessary and only where appropriate security measures and controls are in place to protect your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, regulations and regulatory guidance.
This means these transfers will take place on the basis of an approved data transfer mechanisms, such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses and EU Commission Decisions on Adequacy (country details here).
One of Sky’s data processors (Domestic & General Insurance PLC and Domestic & General Services Limited) may contact you to ensure you are satisfied with your service experience and to let you know about the warranties that apply to your Sky equipment and the options for extended cover.
==========
In the event the structure of our business changes so that another company in the Sky group provides our products and services to you, we will pass your personal information to that company.
This includes, for example, a merger between us and another company, where another company acquires us or some or all of our assets, where we acquire another company or where our holding company restructures our corporate group.
==========
We share your personal data with credit reference (e.g, Equifax), and fraud prevention agencies (e.g. CIFAS) for use in automated credit decisions, for the detection and protection against crimes such as fraud and money laundering, and for debt recovery purposes, as further explained below.
Where we carry out a credit check with a credit reference agency, the information that we give them (including details of your credit application and financial details) and the details of the search itself will be recorded by that credit reference agency.
We also exchange information with credit reference agencies on payment performance under your credit agreement on an ongoing basis and this information could be used by us and third parties to make future credit assessment decisions.
As part of your credit check, the credit reference agency may also review information in relation to individuals who are financially linked to the primary applicant.
==========
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you.
A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you.
==========
Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area.
They may also require the recipient to subscribe to "international frameworks" intended to enable secure data sharing.
==========
CIFAS has published more information about data transfers.
Where appropriate, we may also share your data with other organisations to assist with the prevention and detection of fraud.
We may share your personal data with debt collection agencies where there is an outstanding debt owed on the account.
==========
We do this so that they can use the information, alongside other information that they hold, to attempt to contact you on our behalf so that we can recover the debt.
In some cases, where we have been unable to recover the amount owed, we may sell the debt to a third-party debt management company.
You will be informed when this takes place and following the sale of the debt, any questions you have about communications you receive should be directed to the company in question.
==========
We share certain personal data with third-party app and content providers (such as Netflix and Disney+) when you choose to pay and/or access those third-party services via Sky.
We do this solely to enable and/or verify your ability to access the relevant third-party service via Sky and with certain third party providers this personal data is held on a joint controller basis (meaning we use and share the data for the joint purpose of ensuring your access to the service).
The way those third parties use any other personal data you have provided to them (which is separate from the personal data we share with them should have been explained when you signed up to their service and in any event can be found by visiting the relevant third party app or website and locating their privacy policy.
We share personal data with the courts, enforcement agencies (e.g. the police) and with regulatory authorities (e.g., OFCOM in the UK) where this is required, in order for us to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.
==========
Where Sky receives a request for the ownership of a vulnerable customer’s account to be transferred to a nominated individual, personal data of the existing account holder may be shared with the new account holder.
The ownership of the account would only be transferred once Sky has received signed acceptance and authorisation of the transfer from both parties.
