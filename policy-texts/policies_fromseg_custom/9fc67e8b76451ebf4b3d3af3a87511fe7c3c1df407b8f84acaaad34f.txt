Privacy Policy
APS respects the privacy of members, users of its services, 
        and visitors to its various websites and operates according to the 
        following policies.
Personal Information
Some personal information including addresses, phone 
        numbers, e-mail addresses, and other demographic information is collected 
        for membership, subscriptions and publications, meeting registrations, 
        submission of articles, and other similar transactions.
APS takes 
        precautions to protect your individual information from unauthorized 
        use.
APS may make internal use of your contact information to inform 
        you of situations or services that may interest you.
==========
The APS online Membership Directory is a service restricted 
        to use by members.
It contains basic contact information and membership 
        data.
E-mail addresses are not released to outside organizations, 
        except when a vendor performs a service for APS under its supervision.
Member postal mailing lists are sold on a carefully screened basis, 
        and only when the mailed material is thought to be of significant 
        interest or benefit.
Members may suppress the publication of their 
        personal information in the Membership Directory, decline to receive 
        APS-generated email messages, or request to be excluded from externally 
        sold mailing lists by contacting the Membership Department at membership@aps.org.
==========
Unpublished author or referee information is never sold, and is only 
        used for purposes related to APS, its journals, and/or manuscripts 
        which have been submitted to them.
When you submit credit card transaction information 
        to our site online, we use a secure server with commercial encryption 
        software.
When APS utilizes the services of the American Institute 
        of Physics for certain credit card transactions to purchase APS products 
        or services, those transactions are covered by AIP's similar privacy 
        policy.
==========
Cookies
A “cookie” is a file a Web site places in 
        your computer for future reference.
APS uses cookies to improve some 
        of its services, such as the Meeting Scheduler and the Referee Server.
Information supplied through an APS cookie is used only by APS and 
        is not shared with others.
==========
Server Logs
As you travel through the APS websites, our servers 
        log information about your session.
Information logged includes items 
        such as your IP address, what browser you are using, the time and 
        date you visited, how long your session lasted, and what pages you 
        visited.
We use this information from our server logs primarily to 
        learn about our visitors as a group.
It helps us to improve services 
        on the site and plan for future needs so that we can assure continuity 
        of service.
Systematic (“robotic”) downloads of journal 
        material are not permitted, and an individual log may be examined 
        and/or access terminated when this activity is observed.
Or, we may 
        check an individual log for editorial purposes or when an individual 
        has reported trouble accessing an APS system.
==========
Future Changes
APS reserves the right to change this policy in any 
        manner at any time without prior notice.
If we make material changes 
        to our privacy policy, these changes will be posted on this page.

        Society websites, but not to websites of any APS Division, Forum,
