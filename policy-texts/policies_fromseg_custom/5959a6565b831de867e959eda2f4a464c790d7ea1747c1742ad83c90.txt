We take your privacy very seriously here at the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
When we ask you questions about who you are we are trying to create a overall
statistical view of our userbase to allow us to provide advertisers with the
information they require to place advertising on our site.
That advertising pays for the site which allows us to keep the site FREE
while continually improving it by adding facilities and services.
==========
The data you do provide will therefore be used under the strictest control;
we will NOT give individual answers to questions from third parties or provide
people with your email address without your permission.
Occasionally, we like to send out details about updates to our site, but we do
not do so without first having asked your permission.
You can opt in and out of the various mailing lists using the registration administration
system at any time using the User Administration
pages.
==========
Because we feel very strongly about privacy we are registered with the UK Data
Protection Registrar (IMDb is a UK limited company).
We abide by all relevant
codes of practice as laid down by the registrar.
In addition we abhor the use of "SPAM" email and will not sell or provide your
email address for such purposes.
==========
We have a very limited in-house use of cookies for our registration system.
The bulk of our advertising is served through Doubleclick.
They do not have access to our registration cookies and we do not share personal information about our users with them.
They do their own separate cookies for their tracking purposes.
For more information on what information they collect and how it is used, you can access their privacy policy.
We hope that you will provide us with the fullest details in our registration
and survey pages so that we can build up the best possible view of our users.
Please answer as many questions as you feel happy with.
Thanks for helping make the IMDb the great resource it is.
IMDb Management.
