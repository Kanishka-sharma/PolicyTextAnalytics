The LKQD Advertising Platform
The LKQD Platform helps publishers and advertiser groups power their business by generating revenue from advertisements.
To help publishers and advertisers groups serve accurate and relevant ads, we collect and use a variety of information through our platform, which we describe below.
About Data Collected and Used by the LKQD Platform
We collect information about viewers of the advertisements that are made available through our platform.
The primary purpose for collecting this information is to enhance the likelihood that an advertisement seen by a viewer is relevant to the viewer.
We also use the data we collect to improve and analyze our service, create new services, and report performance metrics to our customers.
The information we collect is not intended to personally identify a specific viewer.
For example, we do not collect a viewer’s name, address, phone number, or account information.
Instead, we collect information that indicates that a specific device tends to be used in ways that suggest certain types of advertisements would be relevant to the device’s user.
==========
The data the LKQD Platform collects and uses includes:
-The type of browser, hardware model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and IP address
-Device IDs associated with a User’s mobile device.
This includes mobile advertising identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA and Android’s Advertising ID.
-Information about websites, applications, and other content that you interact with, which may be tied to a unique identifier, and can include the date and time of your visit to a website, and the referring URL or mobile application name.
-Unique identifiers that we, or a partner of LKQD has associated with a User’s browser, through browser “cookies”, or similar locally stored objects or code.
In addition to data that we collect, we receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support.
The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by LKQD.
==========
Additionally, we may associate user's devices using probabilistic methodologies in order to accurately target and serve ads across devices.
How we use the data we collect
The purpose for collecting this information is to enhance the likelihood that an advertisement seen by a viewer is relevant to the viewer.
We also use the data we collect to improve and analyze our service, create new services, and report performance metrics to our customers.
The information we collect is not intended to personally identify a specific viewer.

We may use the data to create, or collect from LKQD partners, data segments associated with UIDs, cookies, or device advertising IDs.
Data Segments may be based on inferred interests or geo-graphic locations, such as those collected by mobile applications.
Protecting the Data We Collect
We take measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information.

We carefully limit access to the database in which your personal information is stored.
Additionally, we share and transfer your personal information only in the ways set forth in this privacy policy.

We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
We may also (and you authorize us to) disclose personal information about you to credit agencies, collection agencies, and/or merchant database agencies, as we deem necessary.

We use the information that we collect to provide our services, to update you about our products and services, and to improve our site.
We automatically collect certain information from visitors to the site, such as Internet addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit page, operating system, timestamps, and clickstream data.

We also put a text file (commonly called a “cookie”) on the computing device you use to access our products and services.
We use the cookie to make it easier for you to login and re-use personal preferences, as well as to analyze your use of our products and services.
Most web browsers permit you to refuse cookies or to require that you be notified when a cookie is being place.
However, these browser features may interfere with the proper operation of our site.
==========
We do not respond to your browser’s “do not track” signals or other mechanisms for indicating your preference regarding the collection personally identifiable information because we do not track you over time or across third-party Web sites or online services.
Similarly, we do not permit third parties to collection personally identifiable information about your online activities when you use our website.

The company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
Anything you send us, post, or use with our products and services, such as emails or voice recordings, or if other users or third parties send us anything about your activities or postings, we will collect such information into a file specific to you.
We use information in the file that we maintain for you, and other information that we obtain from your use of the products and services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce agreements.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly distribute such information.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from someone under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.
If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
