Introduction
Aktyvus sektorius UAB, doing business as Eskimi (“Eskimi” or “we”), is a global provider of digital advertising media and data management technology.
In our activities we are committed to protecting privacy of individuals (“users”, “you”) and their personal information, therefore we adopted this Privacy Policy (“the Policy”), which is a clear set of rules and provisions we follow in ensuring your personal information is safe and used in strictly in accordance with the applicable laws, such as General Data Protection Regulation EC 2016/679 (GDPR), CCPA, and other applicable guidelines.
==========
We provide a technology platform (“the Platform”) and services which help advertisers reach their audience in an effective way.
This technology also delivers a better Internet experience to users by getting access to the content that is most relevant to them.
==========
The Platform enables our clients, including advertisers and advertising agencies, to purchase advertising inventory, as well as provides our clients with tools to onboard, segment, activate, and understand their data.
In providing services to the clients we cooperate with our international partners, such as Google, and such partnerships allow us to implement the highest level of adherence to international best practices of protection of personal data.
==========
This Policy describes what personal information is collected, how we collect it, what we do with that information, and what controls you have over that information in relation of its use on our Platform.
Information collected via platform
1.
What Data is Processed on the Platform
‍
Eskimi collects certain categories of personal data in the course of delivering an ad to you via the Platform, but do not collect directly identifiable data such as your name, home address, phone number, personal ID number, unless you choose to provide such data directly to Eskimi in relation to special request, inquiry, claim, etc.
Instead, Eskimi collects certain personal data related to your computer or device using cookies and other similar technologies.
With respect to Platform and its services we mostly collect and process personal data that is available to be identified through assigning a special ESKIMI identifier (Eskimi ID) to your browser and/or device.
This identifier allows our Platform to distinguish devices and browsers of different users, and to deliver tailored ads to the user of such browser and/or device.
==========
Eskimi ID is a personal data, which in combination with other data obtained when we’re requested to deliver you ads or showing you ads (bid requests and impressions), allows the Platform to collect another group of information, such as:
imprecise location
browser type
operating system
browser language
internet service provider.
Our clients may import to the Platform personal data regarding your interactions with them when you visit their websites, mobile apps and other digital content sources, such as:
time you visited the site
the page URL
your IP addresses
your browser types
the operating system
the type of device you used (e.g. laptop or desktop) 
data regarding your activities on the website, app or other digital content source
other client data, such as user segmentation made by the client.
We may also receive personal data from third-party partners related to the audience segments, personal information that allows them and/or us to associate Eskimi ID with those partners’ identifiers, as well as the data that associates your different devices with each other.
Such data is also processed on the Platform.

==========
How Data is Collected via Platform
‍
Eskimi uses various technologies to recognize browsers and devices and collect the categories of personal data as described above.
The types of technologies used via the Platform are cookies, device IDs and pixels.
Cookies allows us to identify the device or browser.
Device ID identifies every individual smartphone or tablet in the world.
It is stored on the mobile device and can be retrieved by any app that is downloaded and installed.
==========
Pixels allow us, our clients, and partners to understand how users interact with their websites, apps and other resources of digital content.
In the scope as described above, we receive personal data from third parties such as our clients and partners, including ad exchanges (such as Google Ads), publishers (digital content providers), supply-side platforms, audience data partners.
We process all this personal data in the Platform.
Here you can find more detailed explanation on how Google’s data is used for advertising.

How Data is Used on the Platform
‍
The basic and most important purpose for use of your personal information on our Platform is provision of services to our clients so you can receive tailored advertising based on your needs.
==========
This prevents you from getting targeted with the unwanted and/or not relevant digital content on your browsers and devices.
To make sure you are being served a content you want we engage in remarketing activities, which allow to show ads to people who have been on a particular website or used a certain mobile app.
When a user visits a website or app, the person gets a cookie or ID connected to their device/browser, and our client’s ad may appear on other sites that the same user browses.
Re-targeting can be used on almost all ad-powered pages on the Internet, including ad services like Google AdWords, Facebook, and Instagram as well as other websites/apps.
==========
Eskimi as digital media technology company also uses its Platform to process the relevant data to create new products and services for its clients.
Also, we strive to provide the best possible services and experience to our clients and users, therefore we constantly improve our Platform by processing the relevant information it contains.
