Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible.
We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a voice.
Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites.
Our users may choose to place ads on their site through the Automattic Ads program (including WordAds and Jetpack Ads), and we also show ads from our ads program on some of our own websites (e.g., longreads.com) and in emails.
Data Collection & Sharing
We operate our ads program in partnership with third-party vendors who help us place ads on sites.
We set advertising specific cookies as part of operating our ads program, which enables us and our partners to serve ads, to personalize those ads based on information like visits to our sites and other sites on the internet, and to understand how users engage with those ads.
The personal information we collect through our advertising cookies, which we share with our advertising partners, includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address).
We never share identifiers like your name as part of our advertising program.
