Stardoll uses both technical filters and moderators who supervise what happens on Stardoll's website in order to offer a nice and safe environment.
The moderators also answer members' reports of unpleasant and unsuitable behavior but we still urge all parents to be actively involved in following their children's activity on the Internet.

For citizens in the US the COPPA rules apply to children under the age of 13.
From the terms on Personal Data and Privacy Policy below you can see what information we collect from our members, what we do with it and the limited involvement of third parties.
An overall principle is that we do not collect more information than is reasonably necessary for  children to participate in activities on Stardoll.
If your child is under the age of 13 and attempts to register, the account will automatically be flagged as a pending and limited membership account and we will inform your child that parental consent is required to activate a full membership account.
==========

A more detailed description of the level of activities is presented in the “Notice to Parents” e-mail that you receive from us.
Until this level of verifiable parental consent is obtained your child will only have access to certain features of the Site and have limited access to Stardoll.

-	user name,
-	your age,
-	gender,

By doing so, you give Stardoll permission to use the above personal data so that Stardoll can send out news, contests, offers and advertising to your e-mail address and so that Stardoll can adjust the content and advertising on its website to your or others' age group and gender.
Examples of the e-mail mailings are, for instance, that Stardoll wants to notify you about new or improved services on Stardoll, that Stardoll is carrying out membership surveys in order to improve our services or that Stardoll is creating targeted content and offers for you based on information about how you act on the Web site, what your age is and where you are located geographically.

It can happen that Stardoll comes to rely on other companies in order to carry out various tasks such as, for example, help with marketing, the performing of technical services for our webpages, etc.
These companies can in certain cases gain access to personal data which they need in order to complete an assignment for Stardoll.
Stardoll treats all personal data with the greatest care and signs agreements with other companies which mean that they can only use your data in order to complete the assignment for Stardoll.
The same applies in those cases where Stardoll co-operates with another company to provide you with interesting offers.
Such companies do not have access to your personal data other than for assisting Stardoll with its mailings, banner marketing and the like which you have given Stardoll permission to by this agreement.
Such companies will not have the right to retain and use the data for any other purposes than the assignment for Stardoll.
Stardoll stores all personal data gathered from members for one year after the date when approval is revoked or membership is canceled.
During this year personal data are not used and are saved only for the security of members, that is, in order to prevent, investigate, uncover and prosecute potential crimes against one of our members.
