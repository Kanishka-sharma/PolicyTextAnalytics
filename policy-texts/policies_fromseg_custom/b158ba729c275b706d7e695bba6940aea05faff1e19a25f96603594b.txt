SUBMISSIONS

INFOSEEK is pleased to hear from its loyal fans and welcomes your comments regarding INFOSEEK products, including INFOSEEK's online services.
Unfortunately, however, INFOSEEK's long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested.
We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by INFOSEEK's professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.
==========
Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as stories or character ideas, screenplays, or original artwork.
While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials.
If at our request you send certain specific submissions (e.g., postings to chat, boards, or contests) or, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of INFOSEEK.
None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of INFOSEEK, and INFOSEEK shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions.
Without limitation of the foregoing, INFOSEEK shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions.
