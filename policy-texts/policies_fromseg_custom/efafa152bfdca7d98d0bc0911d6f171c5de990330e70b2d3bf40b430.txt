                    We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SCREENCAST-O-MATIC AND
                    ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES, THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY

==========
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY


                    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SCREENCAST-O-MATIC, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR:
                

                    (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
                

                    (B) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, CONTENT, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SCREENCAST-O-MATIC OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SCREENCAST-O-MATIC, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AGGREGATE LIABILITY
                    FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES FOR MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $2 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO SCREENCAST-O-MATIC FOR THE PAST SIX (6) MONTHS OF THE

We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or

Judicial forum for disputes.
You and Screencast-O-Matic agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these TOS or the Services will be

Both you and Screencast-O-Matic
                    consent to exclusive venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
==========
ARBITRATION


IF YOU'RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:



                        We Both Agree To Arbitrate.
You and Screencast-O-Matic agree to resolve any claims relating to these TOS or the Services through final and binding
                        arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.
You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by sending us a statement of your intention to opt out from this
                        Agreement to Arbitrate, including your name, address, and email address, to the below address within 30 days of first accepting these TOS.
Attention: Dispute Resolution
                        
                        Screencast-O-Matic
                        
                        P.O. Box 45085
                        
                        Seattle, Washington 98145
                    



                        Arbitration Procedures.
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
                        Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Seattle (WA),
                        or any other location we agree to.
==========
Arbitration Fees and Incentives.
The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Screencast-O-Matic will pay all arbitration fees for claims
                        less than $75,000.
==========
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in
                        addition to the award.
Screencast-O-Matic will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim
                        is frivolous.
Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.
Either you or Screencast-O-Matic may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Seattle (WA) or any
                        United States county where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the
                        Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in
                        arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you
                        agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in King County, Washington to resolve your claim.
==========
NO CLASS ACTIONS.
You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class,
                        consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations
                        aren't allowed.
==========
Controlling Law


                    These TOS will be governed by Washington State law except for its conflicts of laws principles, unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of any other
                    jurisdiction.
Entire Agreement


                    These TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and Screencast-O-Matic with respect to the subject matter of these TOS, and supersede and replace any
                    other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these TOS.
These TOS create no third party
                    beneficiary rights.
Waiver, Severability & Assignment


                    Screencast-O-Matic's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining
                    provisions of the TOS will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not
                    assign any of your rights under these TOS, and any such attempt will be void.
Screencast-O-Matic may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or
                    subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
Modifications


                    We may revise these TOS from time to time, with or without notice to you, by posting a copy of the most current version on our website and/or making it
                    available through the Services.
You are responsible for reviewing the TOS, and you will be deemed to have agreed to any modification or amendment to the
                    TOS by your decision to continue to use or access the Services after the date on which the revised TOS are posted or made available through the Services.
