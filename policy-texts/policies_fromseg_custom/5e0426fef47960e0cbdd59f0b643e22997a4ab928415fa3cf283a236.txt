Privacy Policy
Updated as of June 28, 2002
This Privacy Policy discloses the general privacy practices for the Belo Interactive 
  web sites, including KHOU.com.
Belo Interactive, Inc. (“Belo 
  Interactive”) is a subsidiary of Belo Corp.
Belo Interactive is committed to respecting your privacy rights when visiting 
  any Belo Interactive web site, such as this one.
To protect your Personal Information, 
  Belo Interactive has created the guidelines outlined below.
Understanding that 
  Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, any changes to this policy will 
  be promptly posted on this page, with an updated “effective date” posted at 
  the end of this policy.
Information Collected:
While visiting any of the Belo Interactive web sites (collectively, 
  the “Site”), we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally 
  identifies you (“Personal Information”) for purposes of interacting with the 
  Site.
==========
Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, 
  phone number, street address, and e-mail address.
On any page that collects 
  Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required 
  in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in the promotion 
  you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment.
What are Cookies?
A cookie is  a small data text file 
  that a web site sends to your browser, which  is stored on your system.
The 
  Site can only access the information from a cookie sent by the Site.
We cannot 
  access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein.
Additionally, we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about 
  you through the use of a cookie.
The only way we would learn such information 
  is if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, 
  through a registration system, or by entering a sweepstakes or promotion.
==========
We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on 
  the Site.
Some of these ads may contain cookies that are sent by third parties 
  (e.g. advertising agencies or advertising clients).
We do not have access to 
  these cookies or any information that they contain.
We encourage you to contact 
  the advertiser or its privacy policy for more information on these cookies.
==========
Links from other Web sites that appear on the Site may also send cookies; but 
  we do not control such activities.
Why does the Site use cookies?
Belo Interactive uses 
  cookies to track usage of the Site and further personalize your experience when 
  you are visiting the Site.
By tracking usage, we can best determine what features 
  of the Site best serve the users.
==========
What benefits do I receive from cookies?
Overall, the use of cookies 
  helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site.
The information 
  is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user.
==========
Cookies also identify 
  you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password 
  each time you access the Site.
May I decline to accept a cookie?
You may decline to 
  accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject 
  cookies.
==========
However, portions of the Site which require registration will not 
  be accessible to you.
In such cases, we ask that you register and provide us 
  with basic information on our registration page, or sign in if previously registered.
Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate 
  the need for you to log in each time you access our Site.
IP Addresses: Belo Interactive logs IP addresses, or the location of 
  your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting 
  purposes and to determine site usage.
==========
Your IP address does not contain personal 
  information about you.
Use of Personal Information 
We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal Information 
  with third parties outside of Belo Corp. except as described in this Privacy 
  Policy.
We believe we can enhance your experience on our Site with the information 
  you share with us.
We use Personal Information about you to improve our advertising 
  and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content 
  and product offerings and to personalize the Site’s content, layout, and services.
==========
We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing 
  address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest 
  to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we 
  have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions.
Belo Interactive may match specific and/or aggregated Personal Information 
  with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings that 
  interest you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts.
Belo Interactive 
  also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services 
  to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, 
  and for other lawful purposes.
As part of your experience on our Site, you may receive communications from 
  us related to products and services that might interest you.
While we believe 
  these services will enhance your experience at our Site, you will at all times 
  be able to opt out from receiving these communications, either by specifically 
  opting out of these services or by deleting your profile from our database.
==========
Please refer to “Opting-Out” for further reference.
We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third party service 
  providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment 
  services.
When you sign up for a service we offer on the Site, we may be required 
  to share Personal Information with that service provider in order to provide 
  the service.
These third party providers are required to comply with this policy 
  and protect your information in the same way we do.
They are not permitted 
  to retain or use Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to providing 
  the service.
Belo Interactive may also offer other services as a part of our Site (e.g., 
  car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, contests, 
  sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties).
==========
If you choose 
  to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your 
  Personal Information to these parties.
We will not do so without telling you 
  in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not 
  to use these services or features of the Site.
Some of these third parties 
  may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing 
  the service.
We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy for that 
  portion of the Site prior to disclosing Personal Information.
Please refer 
  to “Party Collecting the Information” for further reference.
==========
We may provide Personal Information to our affiliated companies in order to 
  improve our marketing and advertising efforts and your experience with our Site.
Although this Privacy Policy generally applies only to Belo Interactive, and 
  not to activities or information collected by our offline partners, in the event 
  we share Personal Information you provide us on the Site, we will require that 
  our affiliated companies comply with this policy with respect to that information 
  and protect your information in the same way we do.
We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when needed to comply 
  with the law or a legal process, cooperate with investigations of purported 
  unlawful activities, to identify persons violating the law, or in connection 
  with the sale of part or all of Belo Interactive’s or its affiliate’s stock 
  or assets.
Party Collecting the Information
This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information 
  that we collect from you.
To the extent that you disclose any information to 
  other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal 
  ads, or the like, through third party services or promotions offered on or through 
  the Site or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies 
  may apply and Belo Interactive shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination 
  of such information.
The Site may offer forums, message boards, or chat rooms as one of the services 
  on the Site.
==========
If you disclose personal information in one of these forums, this 
  information can be viewed, collected, and used by others.
Belo Interactive 
  is not responsible for the use of information you disclose in these forums.
We encourage you to consult the Forum Rules regarding the policies and procedures 
  that apply to that portion of the Site.
==========
Our Sites may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry co-branded 
  pages.
In addition, other sites may use the Site’s or Belo Interactive’s name.
Since Belo Interactive does not control the privacy policies of third parties, 
  you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, 
  and Belo Interactive shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of 
  your private information by such parties.
==========
Therefore, we encourage you to ask 
  questions and review those parties’ privacy policies before you disclose your 
  Personal Information to others.
Links to Other Materials
Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily 
  under the control of Belo Interactive.
Belo Interactive shall have no responsibilities 
  or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked 
  site or any link or linking program at any time.
Belo Interactive does not 
  necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which 
  the Site is linked.
If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked 
  to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk.
Children’s Privacy
Belo Interactive cares about the safety of children and 
  their use of the Internet.
==========
Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online 
  Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally 
  identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable 
  parental consent.
In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have 
  collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental 
  consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is 
  practicable.
Opting-Out
We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information 
  with us and any third party.
You may choose to “opt-out” of sharing Personal 
  Information in several ways.
When choosing to use certain features or services 
  on the Site, you can choose whether to share optional Personal Information in 
  connection with the feature or service.
==========
If you receive communications from 
  us that you prefer not to receive, you may opt out from receiving these communications,  
  by modifying the contact options in your registration profile.
There are four contact preference options available: (1) “opt-in” includes 
  you in our special offer, discount and other programs with respect to our advertisers 
  and partners via our My Specials Direct e-mail program or a similar program; 
  (2) “site” includes you in our special offer, discount and other programs that 
  relate to this Site from KHOU.com; (3) “phone” allows you 
  to be contacted by telephone with respect to any of these programs, and (4) 
  “mail” allows you to be contacted by mail with respect to any of these programs.
You may choose to be contacted by any or all of these methods, or “opt-out” 
  by not selecting any contact options.
You may change your contact options at 
  any time by following the process described in “Reviewing, Changing, and Deleting 
  Your Personal Information.”
You may “opt-out” altogether from providing Personal Information to us by not 
  registering on the Site and thereby not providing Personal Information.
You 
  may also choose at a later date to have your name removed from our database 
  by deleting your registration profile.
To do so, please follow the process 
  described  in “Reviewing, Changing, and Deleting Your Personal Information.”
Certain portions of the Site and certain services provided on the Site, however, 
  do require registration in order to access or use these areas and services.
If you choose not to register or provide certain information, these areas will 
  not be accessible to you.
