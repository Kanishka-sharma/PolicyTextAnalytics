If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our websites, mobile applications or other products or services ("Services").
==========
We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion.
If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending a notification, posting a notice on the Services or updating the "Last Updated" date above.
==========
Your continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms.
We encourage you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.
If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services.
==========
HAVE FUN

The language below is meant to support this rule.
It allows us to continue providing and improving our Services, and it helps to ensure that a few mean users don't ruin the fun for everyone else.
==========
Your part in that is simple.
Just use common sense - keep sending awesome snaps to your friends, and please don't send snaps that they don't want to receive (threats, harassment, creepiness, etc.).
==========
OUR AUDIENCE

Snapchat is intended for use by people who are 13 years of age or older, and persons under the age of 13 are prohibited from creating Snapchat accounts.
We do, however, offer a limited-functionality version of Snapchat, called "SnapKidz," for children under the age of 13.
SnapKidz includes the familiar interface for taking snaps, captioning, drawing, and saving snaps locally on the device, but does not support sending or receiving snaps or adding friends and, since the experience is local to the userâ€™s device, no Snapchat account is created.
We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity.
You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms, and to abide by and comply with these Terms.
==========
USAGE DATA

By using the Snapchat application you agree to let Snapchat collect information about your usage of the application including interactions with snaps.
For example, when you open a message or capture a screenshot of a snap, we detect those interactions.
You agree that we will share the fact that you took these actions with the sender of the message.
If you choose to use our "Find Friends" feature, you also agree to let Snapchat upload the address book on your device to its servers where we store this data to sync your contacts and find which of your friends are already Snapchat users.
Additionally, we may collect usage information and information about your device such as the model, manufacturer and OS version of device used, MAC (Media Access Control) address, device identifiers, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), and time-stamped logs of messages sent and received and data exchanges, and network status (WiFi, etc.).
For more information about Snapchat's privacy practices, please review our Privacy Policy.
==========
PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

In addition to the other restrictions outlined in these Terms, when using the Services, you agree to not: 1) Use any data mining or extraction methods in relation to the Services; 2) Interfere with or hinder the operation of the Services or any other individual's use of the Services in any way; 3) Inflict or impose any perverse or excessive burden on the Services in any way; 4) Compromise the security of the Services; 5) Use the Services for any purpose that is illegal, beyond the scope of their intended use, or otherwise prohibited in these Terms; 6) Utilize the Services to transmit spam, viruses, bugs or any material that could be considered threatening or unlawful in any way.
You further agree to abide by the iTunes App Store 
	Terms of Service 
	when posting reviews of Snapchat-- posting Snapchat usernames in App Store 
	reviews is strictly prohibited and may result in the deletion of your Snapchat account.
==========
ACCOUNT SECURITY

	After opening an account in the Snapchat mobile application
	(username/password) you accept all responsibility for any activity that
	occurs while logged into your account.
Subsequently, you alone are
	responsible for making sure that your account information including
	your username and password is kept secure and safe.
In the case that
	your Snapchat account is compromised, please notify the Snapchat team
	immediately by visiting http://www.snapchat.com/support.

We cannot guarantee that deletion always occurs within a particular timeframe.

We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your Snaps (e.g., by taking a screenshot).
If we are able to detect that the recipient has captured a screenshot of a Snap that you send, we will attempt to notify you.

In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access Snaps while still in temporary storage on recipients' devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.
You should not use Snapchat to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy.
