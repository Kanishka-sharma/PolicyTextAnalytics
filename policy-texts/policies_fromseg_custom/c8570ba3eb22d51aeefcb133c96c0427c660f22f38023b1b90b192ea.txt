Cookies

In our effort to provide you services customized to your interests, we use cookies to keep and sometimes track information about you.
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.
We use cookies to: access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; identify which areas of BlackPlanet.com you have visited.
You should also be aware that companies that advertise on BlackPlanet.com might use their own cookies.
This privacy policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies.
==========
We send to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of Web sites.
However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages.
Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site.
Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting.
Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you.
==========
Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers
If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability).
Currently, we have relationships with the following third-party ad networks (click to visit their Web site):
