Your Privacy

At Amazon.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy.
We use
the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide
a more personalized shopping experience.
Please read on for more
details about our privacy policy.
What information do we collect?
How do we use it?
==========
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing
address, credit card number, and expiration date.
This allows us to
process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order
status.
When you sign up for our Personal
Notification Services (Amazon.com Delivers, Eyes, and OprahÂ®), we need
only an e-mail address--which we use to send the information you
requested.
When you submit a customer review, we also ask for
your e-mail address, although you can choose not to have your e-mail
address displayed with your review.
When you enter a contest or other promotional
feature, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we
can administer the contest and notify winners.
==========
We personalize your shopping experience by using
your purchases to shape our recommendations about the books, CDs, and
other merchandise that might be of interest to you.
We also
monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop
the design and layout of the store.
We may also use the information we collect to
occasionally notify you about important functionality
changes to the Web site, new Amazon.com services, and special offers we
think you'll find valuable.
If you would rather not receive this
information, visit 

your Amazon.com Subscriptions page 

to change your preferences.
Make sure to change your preferences
for each account or e-mail address you have left with us.
When you send a greeting through the Amazon.com Cards service, we ask for
your e-mail address and that of the recipient in order to complete your
request.
Amazon.com will never disclose or send promotional e-mail to
recipient addresses provided only to the Amazon.com Cards service.
==========
For Purchase Circles, we group the items we send
to particular ZIP and postal codes, and the items ordered from each
domain name.
We then aggregate this anonymous data and apply an algorithm
that constructs bestseller lists of items that are more popular
with each specific group than with the general population.
None of
the data is associated with any individual's name.

How does Amazon.com protect customer information?
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the
use of a secure server.
The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all
information you input before it is sent to us.
Furthermore, all of the
customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.
==========
What about "cookies"?
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your

personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide
features such as 1-Click(sm) shopping and to store items in your shopping

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.
Even without
a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store,
including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them.
Will Amazon.com disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
Amazon.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to
others.
We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third
parties, but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message
to never@amazon.com.
(If you
use more than one e-mail address to shop with us, send this message
from each e-mail account you use.)
==========
Also, Amazon.com may provide
aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and
related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these
statistics will include no personally identifying information.
In summary
We are committed to protecting your privacy.
We use the information we
collect on the site to make shopping at Amazon.com possible and to
enhance your overall shopping experience.
We do not sell, trade, or
rent your personal information to others.
