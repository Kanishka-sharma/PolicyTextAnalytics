Online Banking security guarantee
We're committed to making Online Banking secure and protected.
Our Online Banking Security Guarantee helps provide protection against fraudulent Online Banking transactions, secures your financial information and covers the timely processing of your payments.Footnote 1
Verify account activity
Online Banking provides you with a convenient way to review your account activity and detect fraud earlier.
If you receive an alert for unusual activity on your account, you can use Online Banking to confirm transactions as valid or fraudulent.
==========
Security technology
Online Banking uses industry-standard security protocols that leverage encryption for transferring data.
Encryption helps create a secure environment for the information being transferred between your browser and Bank of America.
These security protocols help protect data in 3 key ways:
Authentication ensures that you are communicating with us and prevents another computer from impersonating Bank of America
Encryption scrambles transferred data so that it cannot be read by unauthorized parties
Data integrity, in terms of data and network security, assures that information can only be accessed and modified by those authorized to do so


Secure your computer
Here are some ways you can secure your computer to help protect your information.
==========
Equip your computer with:
Comprehensive spyware and virus-protection software.
We offer McAfee® Internet Security free to our customers for 12 months.
==========
Up-to-date browser software.
See recommended browsers
Firewall software that prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to your computer or monitoring transfers of information to and from the computer
Consider installing:
Anti-keylogging software that can detect hidden keystroke logging malware and encrypt the keystrokes made on your computer keyboard
IBM® Security Trusteer Rapport™ security software that provides online fraud protection while using our site; we provide it at no charge for our customers
Be sure to download software or applications from well-known or trusted sources.
You should download and install any operating system and software updates (sometimes called patches or service packs) in a timely manner.
==========
Review additional security tips
Monitor your account activity
Checking your account activity frequently can help to detect fraud earlier.
You can receive information quickly about activity in your accounts when you set up Alertsfootnote2.

Set up Alerts now (you'll be asked to sign in to Online Banking and then we'll take you to the Alerts set-up page).
==========
Create strong passwords
Avoid the use of personal information like birthday or a pet's name
Don't choose passwords using dictionary words, names or parts of names, phone numbers, dates, etc.
Choose passwords that aren't easy to guess
Never share them or write them down
Choose a different password for each account.
For example, using the same password on bank accounts and social media may increase risk of identity theft or fraud.
==========
Create passwords according to the website requirements
Browse safely
To help ensure you're on the real Bank of America site before you sign in, check your browser bar
Ensure proper security settings are in place like up-to-date antivirus software as well as updated applications and operating systems
Be cautious about downloading applications.
Only install applications that come from trusted, well-known sites
Understand the risks of using public or free Wi-Fi and sending information over unprotected connections
Turn on the browser's pop-up blocker
Avoid accessing financial accounts from multiple computers or devices
Never proceed with processing an online shopping transaction if a certificate error is received.
If multiple errors occur and the transaction can't be completed, consider calling the company or finding another company that offers the same product.
==========
Don't select “remember passwords”.
If this is chosen, anyone with access to your computer can sign-in as you.
==========
Don't allow websites to keep credit or debit card information
Be smart about social networks
Think before you share personal information.
Don't share what you don't want to be forwarded or seen by the public.
Resist the temptation to post out-of-town plans, “check in” at physical locations or post vacation photos while you are away from home
Avoid posting photos that reveal an address or a specific location
Set privacy settings to allow only friends to see content
Only accept requests from actual friends
Stay informed
Follow internet security issues in the news and discuss them with friends, family and colleagues.

Explore online resources like the National Cyber Security Alliance and Microsoft® Security At Home websites that provide comprehensive information about topics such as securing your computer and safe online behavior.
Here are some other resources you might explore.
==========
Phishing and spoofing
Phishing and spoofing emails ask you to go to a fake website that looks like Bank of America and provide your personal account information.
These emails may even ask you to call a phone number and provide account information.
See an example of a fraudulent email
Ways to identify phishing and spoofing emails include:
Requests for personal information.
Bank of America emails will never ask you to reply in an email with any personal information such as your Social Security number, ATM or PIN.
==========
Urgent appeals.
We will never claim your account may be closed if you fail to confirm, verify or authenticate your personal information via email.
==========
Messages about system and security updates.
We will never claim the need to confirm important information due to upgrades and state that you must update your information online.
Offers that sound too good to be true.
For example, you may be asked to fill out a short customer service survey in exchange for money, then be asked to provide your account number to receive the credit.
==========
Obvious typos and other errors.
These are often the mark of fraudulent emails and websites.
Be on the lookout for typos or grammatical errors, awkward writing and poor visual design.
==========
Ways to protect against phishing and spoofing:
To help ensure you're on the real Bank of America site before you sign in, check your browser bar
Delete any suspicious email you receive before clicking any links or replying to it
Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, includes viruses, spyware and trojans that are designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system, steal personal information and commit fraud.
There are several easy ways you can minimize malware risk:
Never download any file or attachment unless you are absolutely certain what it is and who provided it
Never click on an advertisement that asks for personal or financial information
Update your security and system software to protect your computer from malware threats
Vishing
Vishing uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to leave an automated recording on your phone that says your account has experienced unusual activity.
==========
The message instructs you to call what appears to be a Bank of America phone number (in fact, the caller ID has been fooled into displaying “Bank of America”).
Sometimes criminals also send emails and text messages containing fraudulent phone numbers.
Rather than provide any information, you should contact us immediately to verify the validity of the message.
==========
