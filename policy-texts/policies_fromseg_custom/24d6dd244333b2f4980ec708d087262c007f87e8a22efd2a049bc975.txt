General
We at the D2L family of companies (“we” or “us”) are committed to protecting the privacy of our users.
Please review this Privacy Statement carefully to understand how the information you provide to us will be treated.
This Privacy Statement applies to personal information collected (1) at D2L Web sites and other sites that we own or control (“D2L Web sites”), including www.Brightspace.com, (2) for or by Brightspace enterprise offerings that may be hosted by D2L or its third party service providers, or (3) for or by Brightspace consumer offerings.
There are two main classes of users of Brightspace offerings: enterprise users and consumer users.
Enterprise users access offerings by virtue of an agreement that we have with the user’s institution (educational or otherwise), employer or other organization (“Organization”).
Consumer users are visitors to D2L Web sites, or persons who access Brightspace offerings by virtue of an agreement directly with us.
If you were given access by an Organization as an enterprise user or as a parent or guardian of an enterprise user, this Privacy Statement does not affect or control the Organization’s collection, use or disclosure of your information.
