Information Collection
Psych Central is a private Delaware company owned exclusively by Dr. John M. Grohol.
There are three ways we collect data on this Web site:
Discussion forums (Used for registration and posting only; active; voluntary)
Direct private emails to us (Used to reply to your email only; active; voluntary)
Subscribing to our email newsletter (Used to send you the newsletter only; active; voluntary)
Statistical log information (Used for traffic trends analysis only; passive; involuntary)
All data collected and managed by Psych Central Web sites, as noted above, is used exclusively by Psych Central and is not shared with any third-party.
All data except the statistical logs require active participation on your part.
If you don't want to participate in our discussion forums, send us an email, or receive our email newsletter, we will not know anything personally-identifiable about you.
Statistical log information, used only for aggregate analyses, is the only passive data method we use.
==========
As used by most Web sites online today, our Web server makes a note every time a computer accesses our server with the day, time, resource accessed, and resource referred by.
We use this data to compile daily Web stats on our sites, and no personally identifiable information is available from this information.
If you fail to provide the requested information to register on our discussion forums or send us an email, you may be unable to actively participate in our forums, or receive a reply to your email.
The only way to opt-out of our Web site traffic analysis is to stop visiting this Web site.
All data maintained by Psych Central Web sites is secured by industry-standard methods, such as requiring unique usernames and passwords, secure connections, and restricting access authorization levels to only appropriate personnel.
==========
Choices and Consent
You have a choice about how we use your information here.
We've already told you that we only use the information you provide us for the intended purpose.
We never place people on a mailing list or contact people for marketing or other purposes (unless you have specifically asked us to).
We never share the information we collect on this Web site with others (third parties).
But if you still want out, just email us and let us know.
We'll remove all traces of your presence on our sites to the best of our abilities.
==========
Viewing Your Account
There are two places that you may have an account with us:
Our discussion Forums at Psych Central.
You are welcomed to view and edit your profile anytime by simply logging into the discussion forums.

Security of Your Data
Hey, who wants data to be floating out in cyberspace without security?
==========
Not us, that's for sure.
That's why all of our servers are located in physically-restricted co-location facilities, and are secured with strong usernames and passwords for administrative access.
Databases are password-secured, and information is restricted to only authorized Psych Central personnel who need that information in order to perform their assigned duties and responsibilities.
Our facilities are monitored 24/7 by on-duty security and network administrative personnel in a secured network operations center.
==========
Discussion Forums
During the voluntary registration process for our discussion forums, you may be asked for various identifying information, such as your name and e-mail address.
All information gathered in this process is used exclusively for the registration process; this information is not shared with any third-party for any reason whatsoever.
Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the discussion forums of any Psych Central Web site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.
Such activities are beyond the control of Psych Central.
