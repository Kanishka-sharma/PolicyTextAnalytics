In addition to reviewing this privacy policy, please read our User
Agreement.
Your use of Vogue.com constitutes agreement to its
terms and conditions.
Vogue.com is committed to bringing you information that's tailored
to your individual needs and, at the same time, to protecting your
privacy.
The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the
information you provide us while using Vogue.com.
Vogue.com does not collect personally identifying
information except with your specific knowledge and consent.
==========
And we do not share such information with any outside party
without your explicit consent, so there's no need to send us an
"opt out" message to prevent your name from appearing on a
million mailing lists.
Sometimes you will provide us with data that doesn't reveal your
personal identity.
We use this sort of information for
editorial purposes, and occasionally for other internal purposes—but we don't
connect it to any name, address or other identifying information.
This
way we can give you customized information without compromising your
privacy.
In a few cases—if you e-mail a question or some feedback to us, for
example—we may request your name, e-mail address or other
information so that we can, for example, e-mail you with a personal
reply.
==========
If you choose to supply this information we will use it only for the
specific purpose for which you supply it—unless we tell you otherwise
at the time of collection, in which case you'll have an option to forbid
other uses by us.
In other cases, we may require certain personal information: Again, we
will use such information only for the specific purpose for which you
supply it—unless we tell you otherwise at the time of collection, in
which case you'll have an option to forbid other uses by us.
We will never share any of your personally identifying data with
any other party without your explicit permission, nor use it for
unapproved commercial purposes.
A few special cases are worth noting.
From time to time we may run
competitions or request material we can publish; to participate, you
must usually supply us with your identity, which you agree to have
publicly associated with your submission.
The exact rules vary from
case to case, and will be noted clearly on the relevant pages.
==========
Your
participation will always be voluntary and knowing.
We may offer to send you information or updates from Vogue.com
via e-mail or otherwise; obviously, signing up will put you on a specific
mailing list.
We will not put you on any other mailing lists, from us or
anyone else, without your permission.
==========
In addition, your postings to our forums, chat and any other public
discussion areas are not private.
These postings are governed by our
User Agreement, which is accessible at any time from the bottom of any
page on Vogue.com.
You should be aware that any information you post in our public areas
may be seen, collected and used by others, and may result in
unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
Alas, we can't
control this; you post at your own risk.
==========
You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that are
placed by a Web site in a storage place on your own computer.
Vogue.com uses cookies to control the display of ads—to ensure
that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session, for
example—and to track usage patterns on our site.
Our cookies do not
contain any personally identifying information.
While using Vogue.com, you may notice that our advertisers
occasionally serve you cookies, either directly or when you link to their
sites.
We cannot directly control what our advertisers or these cookies
do, but it's our policy that advertisers on Vogue.com should use
cookies the same way we do.
If you don't like cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option
that allows you not to accept them.
We don't recommend using this
option, though: It makes browsing our site a less enjoyable experience.
Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above,
we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our
users as a group.
For instance, we might report to potential advertisers
that a certain percentage of our users are interested in travel to Las
Vegas, based on information requests.
==========
KIDS: Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any
information about yourself—like your name, address or e-mail
address—over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.
Never buy
anything online without permission.
Oh, and tell your parents to read
this page, too!
PARENTS: We encourage you to get involved with your kids' online
usage so you can be aware of what they're doing.
==========
If Vogue.com
knowingly collects personally identifying data from children, we use it
for internal purposes only—we don't post it, publish it or provide it to
any third parties.
Of course, we treat your personally identifying data
the same way.
As mentioned above, for certain purposes we may use anonymous,
aggregated data about our users.
==========
Kids' information may be included in
this—but anonymously.
If your kids disclose information about themselves in our public
discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other
parties.
Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.
==========
This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; notice of
changes will appear on this page, so check back often.
Any such
changes will be prospective, never retroactive.
We welcome your feedback.
