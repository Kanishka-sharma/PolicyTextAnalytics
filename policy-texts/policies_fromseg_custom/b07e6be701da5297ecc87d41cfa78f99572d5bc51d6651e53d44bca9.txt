At IBM, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information.
In general, you can surf this site (http://www.ibm.com) without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.
==========
There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address.
It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we and our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example -- you can be assured that IBM will let you know how we will use such information.
If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information distributed to others, or if you tell us that you do not wish to receive additional information from us or our business partners, we will respect your wishes.
==========
We are implementing these practices for the IBM Corporate Home Page.
We are also instructing our employees around the world to include information on privacy practices on each IBM web site, tailored to what each site does and reflecting the practices outlined here.
IBM is also supporting the development of some promising tools that will let you manage and control the release of your personal information wherever you go on the Internet.
We'll soon be sharing information with you about efforts underway in organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium and TRUSTe.
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, you can contact us at askibm@vnet.ibm.com.
