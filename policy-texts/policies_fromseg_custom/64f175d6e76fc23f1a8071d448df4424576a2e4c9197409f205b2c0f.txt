The provisions of this Agreement will govern Your use of Our Website(s), and You should therefore take some time to read the Agreement carefully.
==========
Our Website is different from many other websites on the Internet as it contains advertisements, communications, and links posted by independent third parties, over which We exert no control.
We do not get involved in any disputes that may develop between Our advertisers and others, and We do not facilitate communication between third parties.
Therefore, You are urged to use Your own good judgment and common sense when responding to such advertisements, as We are not responsible for any interactions occurring between Our Users and Our advertisers.
Federal law protects sites like Ours from civil claims, so We encourage You to independently research any information found in Our advertisements, before making any decisions.
==========

Additionally, by using any part of Our Site or Services in any manner, You understand and agree that We will consider such use as Your affirmation of Your complete and unconditional acceptance to all of the terms in this Agreement.

Waiver - if You fail to periodically review this Agreement to determine if any of the terms have changed, You assume all responsibility for Your failure to do so and You agree that such failure amounts to Your affirmative waiver of Your right to review the amended terms.
