Bazaarvoice, Inc. has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe’s Web Privacy and TRUSTed Cloud program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.
TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.

TRUSTe’s certifications do not cover information that may be collected from mobile devices.
Overview of Our Services
 We collect information from visitors to websites within the Bazaarvoice Network (“Consumers”) and from Bazaarvoice clients utilizing the BizApps and the Bazaarvoice website (“Clients”).
The Bazaarvoice Services help our Clients to engage with Consumers during the buying process, to gather and display product feedback from Consumers to drive purchase decisions, to analyze and act upon that Consumer feedback, and to serve relevant, targeted advertising to Consumers within the Bazaarvoice Network and throughout the web.
The Information We Collect Through the Bazaarvoice Network
As part of our Services to our Clients, we provide Consumers the ability to review, comment on or rate goods, products and services on websites within the Bazaarvoice Network (collectively, “User Generated Content”).
==========
In order to do this, Consumers are required to create an account with our Client.
You may be asked to submit information, such as but not restricted to, your name, email address, mailing address or phone number, and other Consumer data (collectively, “Consumer Account Info”).
The information within your account, including your review, comment or rating, may be collected by both Bazaarvoice and the website on which your information was submitted.
We use the Consumer Account Info to assist with the creation of an account, provide you the ability to review, comment on or rate products, or otherwise create content on a Bazaarvoice Network website.
The Client on whose site you create your account may use your data in accordance with their terms, which may include publishing your Consumer Generated Content.
Our use of the Consumer Account Info collected on behalf of our Clients is subject to contractual limitations between Bazaarvoice and the Client.
To understand how you can update or access your Consumer Account Info, please see the “Correcting, Updating or Deleting Your Information” section below.
User Generated Content is information submitted by Consumers to publicly accessible areas of websites within the Bazaarvoice Network.
==========
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
We request that you do not include any information within these areas that may personally identify you, such as your name, email address or financial information.
We use the User Generated Content information to help us with marketing research, for new product development, to personalize or improve our Services, to detect fraudulent activities and for analytical purposes.
==========
Cookies and Other Technologies
We use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information from Consumers on the Bazaarvoice Network.
Web beacons are small, graphic images on web pages or web-based documents or in email messages.
Our technologies may collect the IP address of your computer, the pages you visit within the Bazaarvoice Network, the date and time of your visit, or browser type and version (collectively “Analytics and Tracking Data”).
We do this so that we may personalize your experience on the Bazaarvoice Network, determine the usefulness of the information our Services provide and to analyze general user traffic patterns.
Your reviews, comments or ratings, as well as the Analytics and Tracking Data may be combined with additional analytics data we receive from third parties.
This combination of data, referred to as Consumer Data, is used to display targeted advertisements and content within the Bazaarvoice Network and throughout the web, as well as to create aggregate analytics about Consumer behavior.
These third parties are instructed to not provide us with information that personally identifies an individual.
==========
