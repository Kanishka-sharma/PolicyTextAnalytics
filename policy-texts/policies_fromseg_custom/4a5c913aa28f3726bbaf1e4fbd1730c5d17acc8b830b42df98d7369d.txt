UM Mobile App Products Privacy Policy
Effective: January 1, 2020
This Privacy Policy describes how UM, Inc. (“UM” “we” or “us”) collects, stores and uses information about users of our websites (“Sites”) and mobile applications (“Apps”) owned by UM, Inc. (collectively, the “Products”).
By using our Products, you agree to UM’s collection, storage, use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you disagree with anything in this Privacy Policy, please do not install or use Our Products.
==========
Background
Our Products support users’ experience with Twitter including the social apps Echofon, UberSocial, and Plume.
To use these Apps, users (“Users”) need to log in in using their Twitter credentials.
WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED
We collect the following types of information from our Users:
Information You Provide: When you set up your account, provide us with an email, or share information with us in any other way, such as a customer support request, we collect and store the information you share.
This will include your Twitter handle, but not your password which is retained by Twitter.
You do not have to share information with us, but without it you may not be able to access certain content or features of the Products.
==========
Automatic Collection: Like many technology providers, we use common internet technologies such as cookies on Sites and persistent tools on Apps to keep track of users’ interactions with the Products.
These tools will collect general device and browser information, including device type and model, browser type and version, app type and versions, as well as information related to your use of the Products.
We also contract with third party providers who use similar tracking tags on the Products via SDKs, to collect information about your use of the Products, for advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes.
More about this is discussed below.
==========
Publicly Posted: If you post information on public areas via the Products (or elsewhere on the internet), that information is public and may be collected, stored and used by anyone, including us.
We use a Twitter API to pull up your posts and timeline information; such information is stored by Twitter and is not stored by us.
Use of Social Media Applications: The Products utilize certain API “feeds” or other mechanisms provided by third parties, notably Twitter (“Third Party Apps”), to access your accounts as authorized by you when you use of the Products.
==========
Those Third Party Apps may share information about you with us, depending upon the privacy settings you have set within your account for such Third Party Apps.
The Third Party App settings enabled by you do not allow us to access content, data or information not authorized by those privacy settings.
Please refer to the privacy settings in your Third Party Apps account to manage your public profile and other aspects of your account with those Third Party Apps.
==========
Mobile Location Information: If you consent to allow access to your geo location on the Products, and the Products are location enabled, we will collect and store information related to your mobile device location including over time to help provide a better experience with our Products and in connection with advertising, analytics, and measurement.
Some functional use of the Products may be dependent on the data related to geolocation information (such as when you post a tweet from or about a location).
If the settings on your device allow us to receive location information, we may also associate location information with other information we have about you.
You are always free to turn off geolocation on your device (or limit it to certain Apps).
Some of this information may identify a particular device and may be “personal information” under some jurisdictions.
==========
Personal Information, as the term used in the United States, or Personal Data as referred to pursuant to the European Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC (EU General Data Protection Regulations Legislation, also known as “GDPR”) (hereinafter “PI”) has different definitions.
Different regulations around the world may use different terminology and apply a different description of what information is considered personal information, so we encourage you to visit our jurisdictional specific pages as applicable (i.e. GDPR Notice).
==========
The information we collect from devices that may be considered PI are:
your Twitter handle
mobile advertising device IDs (MAIDs): these are IDFAs for iOS, and Android Ad IDs for Android
Information about a User’s activities or actions on the Products and interaction with advertising that run on the Products (session start/stop time, and advertising click-stream information)
IP addresses and general location data that can be extrapolated from an IP address level (city or postal code)
Latitude and longitude geolocation information if a User has provided consent from the relevant Product and enabled the mobile device to share location information.
You are always free to turn off geolocation (or limit it to certain mobile applications) or to adjust your advertising settings on your device
For clarity, and without limiting the above, we do not collect information that directly identifies a natural person, including the following information, among other information: names, email addresses, cell phone or home phone numbers, login passwords, social security, drivers licenses.
We also do not collect financial or other sensitive information.
==========
Advertising on the Products
The Products display advertisements (“Ads”) which are delivered by UM’s services and through third party providers.
When Ads are served, information regarding interaction with the Ads shown to you is collected by the third party advertising exchange partners and us.
The Ads that are served on the Products include targeted, behavioral advertising based upon information compiled about users to provide more relevant advertising content.
==========
UM and third parties operating the ad serving platforms we use, collect and utilize interest, contextual, demographic, geolocation information, and device-related information  (i.e. device ID and browser type, date and time stamps) and information related to Ads served (such as preferences, content viewed, clicks and views) in connection with delivering and measuring advertising.
This data is used to help choose which Ads to deliver and to enhance our advertising and analytics capabilities, as well as to offer analytics measurement and data enhancement services to our partners for their marketing and advertising purposes.
When the Products are location enabled, and you have consented to enabling access to  geolocation data on the Products, UM will collect and process geolocation data over time and use this data in connection with the advertising, measurement, and attribution services as described herein.
To the extent UM makes available geolocation to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy, it will be provided without identifying you personally.
==========
The Products are enabled with tools to support the services of third parties performing advertising and analytics on the Products.
The third party service provider tools implemented on our Products are for the purposes of: advertising services, analytics and crash reporting services, Emoji (in UberSocial/Android and UberSocial/iPhone), Facebook (to enable cross-posting and showing timelines); an Android-file logger (to allow Users to share app logs with us).
To enable these services, those tools will collect and transmit devices ID, device-related and application-related information to those providers.
HOW INFORMATION WE COLLECT IS USED
We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes in connection with the Products, which include the following purposes:
Providing Our Services: Generally we use the information we collect about Users to inform about our products (including advertising) as described in this Policy and to fulfill your requests and validate your User rights; contact and communicate with you; and as otherwise described in this Policy.
==========
Serving Ads: To allow us to offer advertising inventory in the Products and to fill that inventory with relevant ads.
Performance Analytics: To analyze ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Service Usage and Support: To calculate usage levels, to help diagnose server problems, and administer the Products.
Use for Our Services Business (as described in our Business Services Privacy Policy)
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside a User’s country of residence; (b) to comply with subpoenas, warrants, or other legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside an User’s country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, Users, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
==========
WHERE WE SHARE INFORMATION
Anonymous/Aggregated Information.
Anonymous or aggregated information that does not identify you personally, like usage and metrics information, may be shared with others, including partners, developers, potential investors, marketers, and business partners.
Anonymous information helps us understand trends and user needs so that we can better design new products and services and refine existing products and services to serve our customers better.
==========
PI May Be Shared As Follows:
during due diligence or in preparation for or after a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation.
If UM or its assets is purchased, all associated data and information will be transferred.
==========
with those entities who are helping us make the Services available and functional under contract and with safeguards.
These include third-party vendors, technical agents, subcontractors, and our affiliates and consultants who assist us in performing functions to operate our Services.
These functions include, for example, website hosting, maintenance, data analysis, customer support, infrastructure services, technical agents, analytics and metrics services.
==========
These third parties will be contractually restricted in the way they can use PI.
As in any transaction, if you provide your credit card information for purchases on Product, our credit card processor and your credit card company will be provided with all relevant information about us, item(s) purchased, cost and other information necessary to process the transaction.
We use a third party service provider to process payments made on our Sites, so your credit card information is not collected and retained by us.
==========
when permitted or required by law or where we believe such action is necessary in order to protect or defend our interests or the interests of our users or business partners.
We may disclose PI to the extent required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that we need to disclose it in order to comply with official investigations or legal proceedings (whether initiated by governmental/law enforcement officials, or private parties).
If we have to disclose PI to governmental/law enforcement officials, we may not be able to ensure that those officials will maintain the privacy and security of PI.
WHAT ARE MY CONSUMER CHOICE/DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS/OPT OUT
For personal information access, opt out and deletion requests with respect to any PI processed by UM, and for personal data of Data Subjects for residents of EU, UK and Switzerland, you can follow the instructions on our Consumer Choices page.
Please note that we will need your Mobile Ad ID in order to identify your device in our systems.
==========
While CCPA only covers California residents, we will voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to all of our users across the United States, not just those who live in California.
EUROPEAN UNION, UK AND SWITZERLAND ADDITIONAL NOTICE
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and want to find out more about your data protection rights, please see our separate section called “EU Privacy Notice – GDPR”

Business Services Privacy Policy
Summary of Changes
Effective: January 1, 2020
This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile advertising and business intelligence services (the “Services”) of UM, Inc. (“UM” “We” or “Us”) collect, store, and use information about consumers.
If you are interested in the privacy practices for the websites and mobile app products owned by UM, please visit the UM Products Privacy Policy.
Background
Our Services provide advertising and business intelligence solutions to our clients and partners, which include working with publishers, advertisers, data partners, and third party ad exchanges across a network of mobile applications (“Apps”) and websites (“Sites”).
==========
We provide UM advertising optimization and measurement tools to advertisers and publishers and We utilize data science and technology to provide a variety of businesses with useful reports, analytics and information.
The Services use our proprietary technology to understand mobile location information for providing businesses with insights, analytics and research.
==========
HOW IS INFORMATION COLLECTED
UM is able to collect first party data directly from individuals (“Users” or “Data Subjects”) of its mobile apps such as Echofon and UberSocial and from mobile apps of its publisher partners that utilize an UM SDK.
UM owned apps and publishing partners utilizing an UM SDK are required to notify users and gain consent that the data is being captured and will be shared with third parties.
==========
UM also collects information through its demand and supply partners of mobile advertising networks and from select data partners.
In addition to the information collected from Apps as mentioned above, the Services receive information about Users from third party Sites and Apps that utilize affiliate SDKs or other collection interfaces, and through our advertising services and third party ad exchange services, and from data suppliers we work with.
UM only works with third parties that agree to meet required notifications to Users that the data is being captured and will be shared with third parties, such as Cuebiq, whose privacy policy can be viewed here.
==========
Our technology collects information about the geolocation of mobile devices.
We receive geolocation data from mobile devices (using the manufacturers’ advertising device id) provided by mobile App publishers (via SDK or other methodologies), other media supply sources in conjunction with the opportunity to purchase advertising inventory, and via data providers.
We may collect this information over time and across websites, mobile apps and devices.
==========
We also purchase data sets from select third parties where we get sufficient comfort that the data was obtained in conformance to current privacy regulations.
When we receive geolocation data, we rely upon the mobile app publishers and other media supply sources that are responsible for enabling your connection to our Services to request and obtain consent for the collection and use of your geolocation data.
You may also control your mobile device directly by enabling or disabling your location settings on your device.
==========
WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED
When Users visit an App that uses our SDK or the SDK of our partners, We and the partners will collect certain information about devices.
Some of the this information may identify a particular device and may be “personal information” under some jurisdictions.
==========
PI, Personal Information, as the term used in the United States, or Personal Data as referred to pursuant to the European Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC (EU General Data Protection Regulations Legislation, also known as “GDPR”) (hereinafter “PI”) has different definitions.
Different regulations around the world may use different terminology and apply a different description of what information is considered personal information, so we encourage you to visit our jurisdictional specific pages as applicable (i.e. GDPR Notice).
==========
Generally we try to minimize the PI we collect (“Non-PI”).
Non-PI includes: information such as type of browser used (Chrome or Safari), device model and operating system information and version (e.g. iOS ver 10 ),  language preferences, as well as other aggregated and de-identified information.
==========
The information we collect from devices that may be considered PI are:
Unique device Identifiers: The unique IDs that we collect are IDFAs for iOS, and Android Ad IDs for Android
IP addresses and general location data that can be extrapolated from an IP address level (city or postal code)
Information about a User’s interaction with advertising on Apps (advertising click-stream information such as type of ad, type of App, where served, whether User clicked on ad)
Latitude and longitude geolocation information if a User has provided consent from the relevant App and enabled the mobile device to share location information.
If you have previously given consent for collection of geolocation information, You are always free to turn off geolocation (or limit it to certain mobile applications) or to adjust your advertising settings on your device
For clarity, and without limiting the above, we do not collect information that directly identifies a natural person, including the following information, among other information: names, email addresses, cell phone or home phone numbers, login passwords, social security, drivers licenses.
We also do not collect financial or other sensitive information.
==========
PIXELS, COOKIES AND OTHER PERSISTENCE TOOLS
Our Services may use persistent cookie-like tools on mobile devices to enable us to measure the effectiveness related to serving advertising and for business intelligence about the activities of Users on Apps and Sites.
You are free to set your consents on the settings of your browser, operating system and device to de-activate the ability to identify your device persistently.
Please refer to these settings for more information on how to disable your browser or operating system from receiving cookies and controlling your preferences, including to disallow sharing of device level information or to disable geolocation access.
==========
HOW INFORMATION WE COLLECT IS USED
Our Services include business intelligence services, which involve robust data information and reporting to clients.
We use our proprietary tools to transform raw mobile device information collected as described above, including geolocation information, into useful insights for our clients.
==========
We utilize our data science technology to provide our clients with trend and statistical analyses, such as identifying patterns that will enhance the relevance of ads, providing advertisements to certain types of audiences, identifying and optimizing trade areas and business locations, and for helping our clients make informed business decisions about consumer behavior with trend and movement information.
We provide insights, patterns and commonalities to help our clients understand trends and make evaluations about the products and services they offer, such as informing a Partner’s real estate decision about where to locate a store.
==========
With respect to the manufacturer advertising device identifier (MAID) we collect, we store it in our systems as an anonymized, hashed id.
Much of the information is further anonymized into aggregated files and use of data points without unique identifiers or only with a hashed identifier.
The geolocation we collect is also randomly jittered as another step in making the data less personal.
We sell hashed device identifiers with jittered geolocation information to clients and partners that utilize our business intelligence Services.
This information is used in a number of ways to offer such clients information about business trends, reports, patterns.
Our policy is to sell unhashed MAIDs only to clients who need such for cases of targeting advertising, measurement and matching.
==========
UM does not collect data or create data segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we don’t create segments to determine religion or credit worthiness).
UM may create health-related segments such as an inferred interest in diet and wellness, but not sensitive health data such as medical conditions or diseases.
==========
All of our clients who purchase our Services are required to conform to applicable privacy regulations as well as our contractual requirements.
UM prohibits the use of its Services by others for DAA proscribed uses ((a) employment, credit or health care eligibility; (b) insurance eligibility, underwriting, or pricing; (c) unlawful tracking or surveillance of individuals or for generating personally identifiable information.
As a matter of policy, beyond legal requirements, UM does not sell its data products to law enforcement agencies for use in law enforcement activities or to monitor the movement of individuals or groups.
==========
Our Services also include advertising services that allow us to help our advertising and publishing clients provide more relevant advertising and content on the Sites and Apps on our Network.
In general, we use the information collected from and about you and from partners to enhance our advertising services by providing ad content that is more closely related to your interests.
==========
For example, the information is used to create audiences that are grouped together based on shared preferences (e.g., Sports Fans, car enthusiasts, movie goers) and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
Data used to create online audiences is de-identified, helping ensure that neither the ad server nor our cookies contains PI, but will include a mobile advertising device id.
We may assign an UM ID to your browser, computer or mobile device when we serve an ad to it or we identify it on a client’s website or mobile app.
The UM ID and other information collected via the Services can also help our advertising clients measure the effectiveness of advertisements delivered via the Services.
==========
They enable the Services to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a computer or device is the same as one with which the Services has previously interacted.
For instance, the Services can determine that a computer or device to which we served an ad on Monday may be the same computer or device for which we observed a purchase on Tuesday.
==========
In other words, in such cases we are able to infer that a device (e.g. your computer) and another device (e.g. your smartphone) are used by the same owner.
Where we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices.
==========
This is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.
The ad network providers we work with will only pass MAIDs and other information to Us if consent has been obtained from Users.
The publishers of the Sites and Apps request consent from individuals using the Site or Apps and upon our ad exchange partners in passing the information to us.
==========
In addition, for advertising targeted to Users in the EU, Uk, and Switzerland, UM is an approved status vendor and participates in the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (see more at https://advertisingconsent.eu/about/).
Legally sufficient consent is obtained using this framework from those publishers whose Apps utilize the framework.
In addition, You have the ability to withdraw consent at any time by contacting the publisher of the relevant App or Site and checking your privacy settings on your devices and with the Apps and Sites you visit from time to time.
==========
WHEN WE SHARE INFORMATION
UM shares PI and Non-PI that we collect with advertisers, clients, customers and partners as described above.
We may also share PI information, for the following purposes:
during due diligence or in preparation for or after a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation.
==========
with those entities that are helping us make the Sites, Apps, and Services available and functional, like technical agents, payment processing vendors, other subcontractors, and our affiliates and consultants under contract and with safeguards.
These functions include, for example, web site hosting, maintenance, data analysis, customer support, email delivery services, infrastructure services, technical agents, analytics and metrics services.
==========
These third parties will be restricted in the way they can use PI and will need to keep your information confidential and secure.
if permitted or required by law or where we believe such action is necessary in order to protect or defend our interests or the interests of our users, clients, partners, or business partners.
==========
When businesses (not consumers) subscribe to our Services, the order process may request a credit card transaction.
Order information is encrypted when it is transmitted for credit card processing to the credit card services provider and when returned to us.
==========
Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble information in transit.
We use a third party service provider to process payments for our Services, so your credit card information is not collected and retained by Us.
==========
We may disclose your PI to the extent required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that we need to disclose it in order to comply with official investigations or legal proceedings (whether initiated by governmental/law enforcement officials, or private parties).
If we have to disclose PI to governmental/law enforcement officials, we may not be able to ensure that those officials will maintain the privacy and security of PI.
WHAT ARE MY CONSUMER CHOICE/DATA PROTECTION/OPT OUT RIGHTS
For personal information access, opt out and deletion requests with respect to any PI processed by UM, and for personal data of data subjects for residents of EU, UK and Switzerland, you can follow the instructions on our Consumer Choices page.
Please note that we will need your Mobile Ad ID in order to identify your device in our systems.
==========
While CCPA only covers California residents, We voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to all of our users across the United States, not just those who live in California.
SECURITY
All of the User Information is kept on servers that UM manages, using reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of data.
==========
Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or information contained in our servers can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect information, we cannot guarantee or warrant its security.
==========
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
We do not knowingly collect or distribute information from or about children under age 13 (or up to age 16 in certain countries).
If you believe your child has provided UM with PI, such as by registering at one of our Apps without parental consent, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us using the contact information below.
==========

Personal Information We Collect
We collect the following categories of Personal Information under CCPA from Consumers within the last twelve months:
For   Personal Information
Advertising and Business Intelligence Services
Device information such as mobile advertising device ids (MAIDs), ip addresses, and browser typeGeolocation data (if enabled) associated with a device id.
such as latitude-longitude, GPS source, postal code, and country code
Interaction with advertisements including advertising click-stream data
 Our Mobile Apps
Your Twitter handleMobile advertising device ids (MAIDs), ip addresses, and location data (if enabled) associated with a device id;
Browsing history with Apps and interaction with advertisements  including advertising click-stream data
  Our Websites Your ip address and your interactions with the Sites
We obtain the categories of personal information listed above from the following categories of sources:
Directly from Products (mobile apps) and our SDKs
Indirectly from our demand and supply partners of mobile advertising networks and from select data partners.
==========
Directly and indirectly from activity on our website.
For example, from submissions through our website portal or website usage details collected automatically.
==========
Use of Personal Information
As discussed more fully in our Privacy Policies, most of the information we collect and use is de-identified and aggregated information, such as de-identified categories of app use and jittered geolocation information associated with a de-identified device id.
We also provide partners with de-identified device id information, except in the case when the actual device id is needed, such as for targeted advertising and for matching and measurement of advertising.
De-identified and aggregated information is not Personal Information, and we use such information in a number of ways for our business intelligence services as we discuss in our Privacy Policy, including for marketing and targeted advertising and data analytics.
We do not use your twitter handle other than to authenticate your use on our Twitter-based Apps.
==========
Your Rights And Choices
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal Information.
This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Information Request
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Information about you over the past 12 months.
==========
To provide this information we need your mobile advertising device id (which is a unique id number assigned to each device).
We ask you to complete a form and then follow the instructions to provide us with a legible image of your mobile advertising device id.
==========
Once we receive and confirm your consumer request, we will disclose to you:
The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.
If we sold or disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, we will also identify the categories of Personal Information we shared by such sale.
Access Right
CCPA provides consumers with rights to request access of the Personal Information about them when the consumer can verify that they are the rightful owner of the information requested.
==========
We need your mobile ad id in order to identify any device in our systems but we don’t have a way to confirm that the device mobile ad id actually belongs to the particular person making the request.
That’s because we do not collect the information that would match the device id to the actual owner (such as a name or account information) to allows us to confirm that the consumer requesting the information is the same consumer that owns the device.
It would require us to actually collect more Personal Information to try to verify who the device owner is, such as requesting a full name, address, and receipt of purchase of the device.
Additionally we want to avoid the potential risk of providing a requestor who provides a mobile ad id with the Personal Information that belongs to another individual.
For example, a requestor can take a snapshot of the device id of his/her friend and request her Personal Information without her consent.
Accordingly, in a matter of caution, we are not able to provide the particular file associated with any particular mobile advertising device id.
==========
If you are uncomfortable with our having any Personal Information about you, please send us a request to opt out or to delete your information.
Opt Out Of Sales And Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we opt out your Personal Information from any sales.
You also have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information.
==========
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will honor your request (and direct our service providers to as well).
We may deny your deletion request if we cannot verify the device id or it meets one of the exemptions under CCPA.
We will also retain a copy of our records related to processing your request.
==========
Exercising Access, Opt Out, And Deletion Rights
To exercise the rights described above, please visit our Consumer Choices pages.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
==========
We cannot respond to your request if we cannot verify your mobile device identity to confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use Personal Information provided in the request to process the request and to a retain a record of the request.
Response Timing And Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

Here is information about how you can control, delete or opt out of further sales with respect to this information.

If you have provided us with contact information for a business relationship (sales) or customer support, you can ask us to delete this information using the email privacy@ubermedia.com.
In some cases, We need to send you “transactional” emails relating to normal business operations.
For example, we may email you to inform you about certain account activity.
You cannot opt out of these emails.
==========
Your Use of our Apps

When you utilize our mobile apps (“Apps”), we collect your twitter handle and information about how you use those Apps and/or respond to advertisements on those Apps.

Services
The categories of Personal Information collected by UM’s business services are mobile advertising device ids (MAID), IP addresses, advertising click stream information and location data associated with that device as discussed more fully in our Business Services Privacy Policy.
Among other things, we do not collect an actual cell phone numbers or your name, full address or email address.
==========
A sample of what Personal Information for a device is as follows
Mobile advertising device id
IP Addresses and general (city or postal code) location data that can be extrapolated from an IP address
Latitude and longitude points
Timestamps with local dates and times and time zones
DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION
If you would like to opt out of all sales of any Personal Information we may have associated with your device, please click here to complete a form to OPT OUT OF SALES.
The information you supply to us for this request will only be used for the purpose of identifying the Personal Information about the device which you are requesting and responding to your request (including a record of our efforts).
DELETION REQUEST
If you would like us to DELETE the Personal Information or Personal Data we have associated with your device, please click here to complete a form to request DATA DELETION.
The information you supply to us for this request will only be used for the purpose of identifying the Personal Information about the device which you are requesting and responding to your request (including a record of our efforts).
ACCESS
Certain jurisdictions also provide consumers with rights to request access (correction or portability) of the Personal Information held about them.
==========
We are not able to provide you with the particular file about any particular device because we are not able to confirm who the actual device owner is.
We need your manufacturers’ advertising device id (the IDFAs for iOS, and Android Ad IDs for Android, “MAIDs”)  in order to identify the device in our systems but we don’t have a way to confirm that the device MAID belongs to any particular person.
We do not retain information that would match the device id to the actual owner, so we do not have a way to confirm that the consumer requesting the information is the same consumer that owns the device.
==========
It would require us to actually collect more Personal Information to try to verify who the device owner is, such as requesting their full name, address, and receipt of purchase of the device.
Additionally we want to avoid the potential risk of providing a requestor who provides a MAIDwith the Personal Information that could belong to another individual.
For example, the requestor takes a snapshot of the device id of his fiancée to request her Personal Information without her consent.
If you are uncomfortable with our having any Personal Information about you, please complete the form to request a DATA DELETION.
==========
