I. Information That We Collect

Personal Information
																At various locations on our websites, such as in registration forms, 
																sweepstakes entries, message boards, online stores, surveys, and polls, we may 
																request that you supply us with "personal information," such as your name, 
																email address, mailing and shipping addresses, home or work telephone number, 
																and/or credit card information.
You will always know when we are collecting 
																personal information, because we only collect personal information when you 
																voluntarily submit it to us through our online forms and questionnaires.
Although you do not have to provide us with any information to visit our 
																websites, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the services on our 
																websites if you choose not to provide certain information.
If you do choose to 
																give us personal information through our websites, we will collect and retain 
																that information.
Non-Personal Information
																When you use our websites, we may also collect "non-personal information," 
																which is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact 
																you, such as demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, 
																profession, zip code, etc.).
Non-personal information may also include 
																technical information, such as your IP address, the type of browser you are 
																using, the websites you visit immediately before and immediately after you 
																visit our websites, and other anonymous data involving your use of our 
																websites.
Non-personal information may also include information that you 
																provide us through your use of our websites, such as the time zone you select 
																if you use a TV schedule feature, or the terms you enter into the search 
																functions of our websites.
Online Stores
																We may collect personal information from you when you purchase products from 
																our online stores.
For example, we may require you to provide your name, 
																contact information, shipping and billing addresses, and a credit card number 
																before we process your orders.
We also collect information about your 
																transactions with us.
We may use the information that you provide to 
																communicate with you about products purchased through our online stores, to 
																provide customer support in connection with those products, and to send you 
																information about other products and services which we believe may be of 
																interest to you.
==========
Cookies
																We use "cookies" to enhance your visits to our websites.
A cookie is a small 
																amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on 
																your computer's hard drive.
Cookies do not store personal information about 
																you, unless you knowingly provide it.
Cookies can store non-personal 
																information, such as what websites, pages, or advertisements your browser has 
																accessed.
We use cookies to store information and personalize your experience 
																with our websites.
For example, cookies allow our websites to recognize your 
																browser as a previous visitor, and thus save and remember any preferences that 
																may have been set while you were previously browsing our websites.
Our cookies 
																can also store your password, personalize pages, and keep track of selections, 
																such as your time zone and episode selections, or items you have placed in a 
																"shopping cart."
==========
You do have control over cookies.
Most browsers can be set to notify you when a 
																cookie is being placed on your computer.
Most browsers can also be set to 
																refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience.
You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer.
For more 
																information about working with cookies, you should consult your user manual, 
																FAQ, or "help" function of your specific browser and operating system software.

II.
How We Use the Information We Collect

Our Services and Websites
																We use your personal information to provide you any services that you may 
																request or require, to communicate with you, to allow you to make purchases, 
																and to allow you to participate in online contests, surveys and games.
We use 
																aggregated non-personal information about our users to understand our website's 
																demographics, such as the percentage of male and female users, the geographic 
																distribution of our users, the age ranges of our users, or a combination of 
																these or other demographics.

																If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal 
																information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your 
																questions or comments for future reference.
However, aside from our reply to 
																such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you 
																request a particular service that involves email communications, you otherwise 
																consent to being contacted by email or if such contact is to communicate with 
																you about products purchased through our online stores, to provide customer 
																support in connection with those products, and to send you information about 
																other products and services which we believe may be of interest to you.
There 
																may be times when you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an email list 
																or electronic newsletter that will send information about our websites or our 
																advertisers to your email address.
==========
However, we will provide you with the option 
																to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications.
You 
																may request at any time that we not email you in the future by clicking the 
																"unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any email that you 
																receive from us, or by contacting us at privacy@HGTV.com.
If you unsubscribe, we will make reasonable efforts to discontinue these email 
																communications as soon as practicable.
==========
If you make a purchase through our online stores, we may use the information 
																you provide to send you important announcements and updates regarding our 
																websites or online products.
You may also receive periodic mailings regarding 
																new products and services.
However, you may opt-out from receiving future 
																mailings by contacting privacy@HGTV.com or:

																When you provide us with your personal information to make a purchase through 
																our online stores, we use this information to process your online order and 
																credit card number.
We also use your address and billing information to bill 
																you and provide associated support.

III.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

Affiliates and Non-Affiliates
																Except as specifically set forth in this Policy, we do not share your personal 
																information with any non-affiliated third party without your permission.
We may 
																disclose aggregate information, such as demographic information, and our 
																statistical analyses to third parties, including advertisers or other business 
																partners.
This aggregate information does not include your personal 
																information.
==========
We may, however, share your personal information with certain 
																websites that control us, are controlled by us, or under common control with us 
																(our "Affiliates"), such as the HGTV.com,
																FoodNetwork.com, 
																	DIYNetwork.com, GACTV.com and 
																	FineLiving.com websites, and websites operated by our Affiliates or 
																other businesses of the E. W. Scripps Company, our parent company, so that they 
																and we can offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.
Please refer to our Affiliates' privacy policies for details regarding how they 
																handle your personal and non-personal information.
Service Providers
																We sometimes engage unaffiliated businesses to assist us in providing you 
																certain services.
For example, we may hire a shipping company to help us 
																deliver our products or services to you.
We may also use third parties to 
																process online transactions and credit card payments, provide advertising, 
																marketing and promotional assistance, provide email services, or facilitate our 
																online services (such as message boards, chat rooms, and surveys).
In those 
																instances, we may need to share your personal information with them.
We require 
																these companies to use your personal information only to provide the particular 
																product or service and do not authorize them to use your personal information 
																for any other reason.
We sometimes offer promotions (like sweepstakes or free subscriptions) in 
																conjunction with a third party sponsor.
If you choose to participate in one of 
																those promotions, we may share your information with the sponsor if they need 
																it to send you a product or other special promotion they offer.
==========
Business Transactions
																As SNI and its websites continue to develop, we may buy, sell or combine with 
																other businesses.
If so, personal and non-personal information that we or other 
																businesses have collected will likely be transferred as part of the 
																transaction.
If we sell a business, we will attempt to ensure that requests 
																made of us regarding email communications will be honored.
==========
Public Forums
																We feature public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards, 
																or similar activities where you and other users of our websites can communicate 
																with one another.
This Policy does not protect you when you use these public 
																forums or provide information (including personal information) about yourself.
Any information you share in a public forum such as a chat room, message board, 
																or bulletin board is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, 
																including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy.
SNI is 
																not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you 
																choose to publicly post or share through our websites.
==========
Third Party Advertisers
																We use third-party advertising companies to deliver specific advertisements to 
																you, which appear on pages throughout our websites.
These companies collect 
																non-personal information about your visits to our websites and other websites 
																in order to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of 
																interest to you.
These companies may also aggregate your non-personal 
																information for use in targeted advertising, marketing research, and other 
																similar purposes.
These companies may place their own cookies on your computer.
If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting and using this 
																information, you may visit each third party advertiser's website directly and 
																opt-out.
You may also visit Network Associates at 
																	www.nai.com for solutions regarding consumer privacy.
==========
Other Disclosures
																We may disclose personal information when we are required or requested to do so 
																by law, court order or other government or law enforcement authority or 
																regulatory agency; to enforce or apply our rights and agreements; or when we 
																believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or 
																advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety 
																of SNI, our users, or others.
This includes exchanging information with other 
																companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
We 
																reserve the right to use or disclose non-personal information in any way we see 
																fit.
IV.
==========
Security of the Information We Collect

																The security of your personal information is important to us.
We maintain 
																physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help secure your personal 
																information.
However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and 
																there is always some risk in transmitting information electronically.
The 
																personal information we collect is stored within databases that we control.
As 
																we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry 
																standards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to help protect your 
																information.
However, since no security system is impenetrable, we cannot 
																guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information 
																you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the 
																Internet.
Of course, any information you post to any message board, discussion 
																group, or other public posting area on our websites is available to anyone with 
																Internet access.
V. Accuracy of the Information We Collect

																Any questions you may have regarding our Privacy Policy, the accuracy of your 
																personal information or the use of your personal information, or any requests 
																that we correct, update, or remove your information in our databases, should be 
																directed via email to privacy@HGTV.com, 
																or via telephone to 865-694-7879.
You also can write us at:
															

																Scripps Networks, Inc.
Attn: Web Privacy Policy Department
																PO Box 50970
																Knoxville, TN 37950
															

																After receiving a request to change your information, we will make reasonable 
																efforts to ensure that all of your personal information stored in databases we 
																actively use to operate our website will be updated, corrected, changed or 
																deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable.
==========
However, we reserve 
																the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove from or 
																change in our active website databases.
We may retain such information to 
																resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms of use.
In 
																addition, it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of 
																the information you have provided to us.
A copy of your personal information 
																may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to 
																locate.
==========
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 17, 2006.
We reserve the right to 
																change this Privacy Policy at any time, and will post any changes to this 
																Privacy Policy as soon as they go into effect.
Please refer back to this 
																Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
