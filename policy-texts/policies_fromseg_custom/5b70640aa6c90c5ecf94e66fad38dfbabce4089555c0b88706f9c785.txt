These Tracking Technologies may include first party cookies (i.e., those placed by the website being visited) and third party cookies (i.e., those placed by a website other than the one being visited), local shared objects (commonly referred to as “Flash Cookies” or “HTML 5 Cookies”) and tracking pixels (including transparent or clear gifs).

==========
As of the effective date of this Privacy Statement, we do not have a mobile application and do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you use our Services, but we may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services.
Please note, however, that some of the information we collect from a device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device’s location.
If you fail to provide your Personal Data

Where we need to collect your Personal Data by law, or in order to perform a contract we have with you or your employer or are trying to enter into with you or your employer and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into (for example, to provide you with our Services).
How do we use information we collect?
(a) We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows us to do so.
We may process your Personal Data upon more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.

This applies particularly where we use your Personal Data to administer your use of the Service, (ii) where it is necessary for a legitimate interest and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
==========

This applies particularly where we use your Personal Data to better understand your needs and interests, to improve our Service, to personalize and improve your experience, to provide or offer Service updates and other product announcements or otherwise to do anything with your Personal Data that we consider to be necessary for our legitimate interests (and typically also to be for the benefit of our users and therefore also for your benefit, whether directly or indirectly), and (iii) where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
