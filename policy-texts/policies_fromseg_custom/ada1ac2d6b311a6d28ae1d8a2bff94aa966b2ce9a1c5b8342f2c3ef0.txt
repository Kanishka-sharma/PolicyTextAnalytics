MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC.
INTERNET PRIVACY STATEMENT
Introduction: Marriott has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy.
We understand that visitors to our websites may have questions about whether and how these websites collect and use information.
Accordingly, we have prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern our internet websites.
==========
Browsing: Visitors who browse our websites do so on an anonymous basis.
We have not configured our website to collect any information from your computer without your input.
This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with information, we will not know your identity, your e-mail address, or any other information identifiable to you.
Information: If we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.
For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for the information we need for purpose of your stay.
We may also ask for information from you to complete a gift purchase transaction, to fill out an online customer survey, to obtain your suggestions or comments about your use of Marriott services, or for similar purposes.
If you use our websites to register for our Marriott Rewards program, the terms and conditions of that program will apply.
==========
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and strict corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information.
Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures depending on the applicable legal requirements.
Information is generally processed and stored in the United States, in which data protection laws are not as comprehensive as in the European Union.
==========
Cookies: Our websites make only limited use of "cookie" technology.
"Cookies" are strings of text that a website transmits to a user's computer.
Cookies enable a website to keep track of a user's preferences and activities relating to that website.
Our websites create a temporary cookie for each visit in order to facilitate your visit.
==========
For example, our cookies are used to "remember" the purchases of gift certificates that you place in the "shopping basket" for that visit, to customize the appearance of our website based on the hotel brand you initially sought to visit (i.e., based on the website address you initially typed in), or to prevent the same user from making repeated enrollments in our Marriott Rewards program.
Our cookies expire automatically soon after you leave our website.
These cookies transmit no information about you or your computer back to Marriott.
If you do not wish to receive these cookies, you may set your browser to reject the cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our website.
Conclusion: Your privacy concerns are important to us.
We hope this privacy statement regarding our internet websites has been helpful to you.
