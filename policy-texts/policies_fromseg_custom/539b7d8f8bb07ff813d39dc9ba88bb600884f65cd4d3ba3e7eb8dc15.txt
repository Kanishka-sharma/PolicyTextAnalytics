PRIVACY POLICY INTRODUCTION
Oracle Corporation and our subsidiaries and affiliates ("Oracle" or "we") respect your preferences concerning the treatment of personal information that we may collect from your use of the Oracle.com Web sites and your interactions with Oracle off-line.
This policy lets you know how we collect and use your personal information, and how you can control its use.
This policy describes the broadest potential use of personal information throughout the Oracle.com Web sites and in off-line transactions.
We may make far less use of personal information than we have outlined in this policy.
==========
Because of the differences in how certain Oracle lines of business and offerings collect and use personal information, Oracle has established separate privacy policies that govern those different activities.
The following privacy policies are specifically tailored to the relevant line of business or offering, and are separate and distinct from the activities governed by this privacy policy:
The services privacy policy, which addresses customer data to which we may be provided access in order to perform consulting, product support, outsourcing and other services.
The Exchange.oracle.com privacy policy, which addresses information shared in an online commercial trading community.
The Profit Magazine and Oracle Magazine privacy policy, which addresses information we collect from subscribers to these publications.
In addition, the Oracle Education Foundation's Think.com privacy policy and Thinkquest.com privacy policy address information the Foundation collects as part of its non-profit education initiatives.
==========
The Oracle.com Web sites provide links to non-Oracle sites we believe may be of interest to you.
Those sites are beyond our control.
You are advised to check the privacy policies and terms of use of any non-Oracle sites before providing your personal information to them.

SECURITY
The security of your personal information is very important to Oracle.
We have in place physical, administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access.
In addition, Oracle uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive data such as credit card details.
In the event that your personal information is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, Oracle will notify you of the breach by email or fax or, if Oracle is unable to contact you by email or fax, then by U.S. mail.
Oracle will give you notice promptly, consistent with the reasonable needs of law enforcement and/or Oracle to determine the scope of the breach and to investigate and restore the integrity of the data system.
