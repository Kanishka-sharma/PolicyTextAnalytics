Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website.
==========
Web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Online Properties or taken an action in relation to our Online Properties.
We also facilitate our organisers ability to learn more about your interest in their event at their request through their use of these tracking pixels on our Online Properties.
