MailChimp Privacy Policy

Our pledge to you

When you sign up for a free trial, you will not be subscribed to general MailChimp marketing.
When you request a free sample, or use the "contact us" form to send us an email, we do not save your email for future marketing use; nor do we sell, rent, or give it away.
We don't believe in sending those annoying "why won't you buy?"
emails to free trial members.
If you sign up for a free trial, and you never use it for a really long time, we'll send an email asking you if we can close out your account.
==========
All MailChimp user accounts may receive "System Update" messages which usually include: planned outages, system improvements, version updates, point releases, abuse warnings, and important customer service information.
Nobody is automatically subscribed to any general MailChimp marketing emails.
We believe people should only receive emails if they opted in for them.
If you submit a help ticket to MailChimp, our system may automatically send you a brief survey email, requesting your feedback on how your issue was resolved.
==========
We use this information to improve our customer service.
Use of Cookies

We temporarily store session information, so that registered users do not have to login every time they visit the site.
We place temporary cookies on web pages so that we can see how visitors use our website, but they do not identify users (we use this information to improve our website experience)

The trackers do not personally identify any visitors to our website.
They simply tell us about the performance of our banner advertising
