You can visit our site and use most of our services without   having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally identifiable   information to us.
There are, however, a few instances where we do   collect personally identifiable information in order to fulfill your   request.
Whenever you visit Liveleak, our web server logs automatically   receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including   your IP Address, Liveleak cookie information, the Liveleak page(s) you   request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query.
Liveleak uses this anonymous information to customize your   experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages,   and to improve our services in general.
This information allows other   users to benefit from the quality searches you perform, ultimately   receiving the most relevant, pertinent information.

We ordinarily do not   attempt to link this information to a specific person.
When you register to become a Member of the Liveleak   website, Liveleak collects certain information such as your e-mail   address, and your domain URL (collectively, "Membership Information").

Some contests, sweepstakes and other promotions that   will appear on the Liveleak website may also be sponsored by other   companies.

How Do We Use Personal Information?
==========
Our primary goal is to provide members with the most   useful and enjoyable experience on the Internet.
Our advertisers will   never be privy to your Membership Information, unless you permit us to   give it to them so that they can provide you with products or services.
Your e-mail address may be used by us for communications related to the   Liveleak services, including but not limited to sending notices about   new features, products, or other information of interest to you.
The Liveleak website is constantly evolving and   changing in content and in features.
Member Information helps guide such   changes and the evolution of our websites.
Our advertisers and   affiliates may be provided general information or data regarding   membership usage patterns or interests, so that they too can better   serve your needs and preferences, but such disclosure will not include   individually identifiable information.
The collection of usage and   interest information allows us to provide a constantly evolving and   user-sensitive package of services, products, and features that satisfy   member needs, wants and desires but always with the priority of   protecting individual member privacy.
