Privacy Policy

Rodale is a family-run business that treats its customers like family....



We believe in honoring our readers' privacy wishes.
Rodale readers have the option at any time to decide whether or not they wish to have their names on a list used to promote Rodale books and magazines, or on any Rodale list used by other companies to promote appropriate products and services.
Our customer satisfaction representatives are trained to give privacy-related correspondence the highest priority, and to make sure the customer's wishes are reflected in all our customer service operations as soon as possible.
Occasionally, Rodale mailings prepared several months in advance may include a customer's name, even after a customer has asked to be removed from our mailing lists.
As a result, the customer may receive mail from Rodale within one or two months after the request.
We apologize for this inconvenience, and we will make sure that mailing lists prepared after such a request will reflect a customer's preference not to receive our mail.
==========
We Believe in responsible stewardship of customer information.
How will Rodale use information about its customers?
Rodale will use only that information that will enable us to effectively serve our readers' accounts and to offer new products.
We will advise our readers of the general intended use of such information upon request.
==========
Who has access to customer information?
Rodale will limit access to reader information on a "need to know" basis and to only those employees responsible for conducting business with our customers.
We recognize the responsibility that comes with handling information and will apply stringent security measures to safeguard information about our customers.
==========
In what ways will Rodale share customer information?
Sometimes, Rodale makes its list of customer names and addresses available to carefully screened organizations.
Outside of these organizations, Rodale will not disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority.
==========
We Believe in the three rules of good communication -- accuracy, accuracy, and accuracy!
Rodale will employ rigorous safeguards -- both in technology and in employee practices -- to ensure the highest possible standards of accuracy, completeness and timeliness of all information about our customers.
In addition, we will seek assurance of information quality from other list sources.
If you have any questions or comments about Rodale's Privacy Policy, or if you would like to make us aware of your preferences regarding information about yourself, please call 1-800-848-4735 or e-mail: privacy@rodale.com.
