Avast SecureLine VPN is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) â€” a secure, encrypted connection that protects your data by functioning as a private tunnel through the internet.
It also masks your IP address by redirecting your traffic through one of our lightning-fast servers around the world.

The combination of the VPN server and the encryption blocks your ISP, governments, hackers, and anyone else from spying on you as you navigate the web, which is just one of the many reasons why you should use a VPN.
Avast SecureLine VPN lets you hide your IP address and keeps your online activity completely private and anonymous.
It stops third parties from spying on your online activity and lets you safely use unsecured public Wi-Fi.
You can also unblock websites and access geo-restricted content from wherever you are.
