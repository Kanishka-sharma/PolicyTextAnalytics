For Go Daddy Marketplace Customers Only 
When you purchase goods through Go Daddy Marketplace, you are granting Go Daddy express permission to share your name and contact information (as well as the "ship to" name and contact information, if different) with the merchant from which you make the purchase, for the purposes of shipping and order fulfillment only.
By making a purchase from a merchant, you are not granting that merchant consent to use your information for marketing or any other purposes unless you specifically "opt in" to do so.
Go Daddy has agreements with the merchants on Go Daddy Marketplace requiring them to maintain the privacy of your information; however, Go Daddy is not responsible for improper use by merchants of your information.
When you create a storefront to offer goods for sale through Go Daddy Marketplace, you will be prompted to enter information about your business, including business name, e-mail address and telephone number (all mandatory), and address, fax number and business hours (all optional).
The business information that you enter will be publicly displayed on your storefront page, and will be included in confirmation e-mails sent to people who make purchases from you.

We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN's rules, regulations and policies.
==========
Third Party Service Providers 
We may at times provide information about you to third parties to provide various services on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments, serving advertisements, conducting contests or surveys, performing analyses of our products or customer demographics, shipping of goods or services, and customer relationship management.
We will only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested service.
These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
==========
In the event that we use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf, these companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gift or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.
Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.

==========
Supplementation of Information 
In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources (  e.g.,  information from our strategic partners, service providers, or the United States Postal Service).
We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
Contests/Surveys 
From time-to-time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys.
If you choose to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you.
Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information.
The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level - note that you must be 18 or above to enter).
==========
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, and to personalize our site.
We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests.
When we do, that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
==========
Tell-A-Friend 
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask the user for the friend's name and email address.
Go Daddy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our web site.
Go Daddy stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
The friend may contact Go Daddy at  support@godaddy.com  to request the removal of this information from our database.
What Happens to my Personal Information if I Terminate my Go Daddy Account?
==========
When your Go Daddy account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally identifiable information is placed in "deactivated" status on our relevant Go Daddy databases.
However, you should know that deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely.
We will retain and use your personally identifiable information if necessary in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.

If you are visiting this web site from a country other than the country in which our servers are located (currently the United States), your communications with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.
