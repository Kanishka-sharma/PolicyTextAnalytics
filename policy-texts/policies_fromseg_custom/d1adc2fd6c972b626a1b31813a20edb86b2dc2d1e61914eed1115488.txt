We have set out below the categories of data we process and why we process each category of data.
1.
Usage Data and Profile Information
1.1 Usage Data
We collect information about how internet users browse the internet and interact with online content and advertisements through our ShareThis Icon, the ShareThis Publisher Applications and user interactions with advertisements on the internet.
We call this “Usage Data”.
Usage Data includes: 
the unique IDs of the cookie(s) placed on your web browser (example: 37d387ca-f68a-11e5-b87d-0e58954c72b1)
Information about the user’s browser and device
Webpages viewed (including the URL addresses of such pages and search parameters, which may include search terms and key words) and the previous web pages that referred the user to that webpage 
Time when webpages are viewed
Search queries from which users are directed to a webpage
Navigation from page to page
Time spent on each webpage
Interactions with the webpage, including items clicked or selected and content highlighted or copied
Ads viewed or displayed to the user and the user’s interactions with those ads
Shares of content including what content is shared and where – for example, the relevant social media site (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)
Geographic information such as country, city, state or postal code.
IP addresses
Device IDs
Although the Usage Data listed above is not used by ShareThis to directly identify an actual person, it is considered to be personal data in many places.
1.2 Profile Information
We receive information about the content of the websites that you visit and information about the audience of those websites to enable us to infer and create groups of users who have similar characteristics, interests or behavioral patterns.
We combine the Usage Data with data we receive from third party advertisers, analytics vendors and data partners to create categories of data that are helpful to advertisers seeking to deliver a more personalized advertising experience.
==========
For example, if a user regularly views or shares content about shopping for a car, our systems may infer that this user may be interested in purchasing an automobile.
This practice is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising, and a segment titled “interested in automobile” is sometimes referred to as an audience segment or a “profile.”
When we group this data into profiles, we refer to it as “Profile Information”.
We can infer this Profile Information (by reference to browser identifiers, not actual names) using the information we obtain from third parties about the likely content and characteristics of the users and audiences of the websites which are visited.
==========
For example, users of a particular website may have an interest in cars and typically be within a certain age or income range.
Where we are able to infer that two or more browsers or devices are the same user or household, we may use that information to bolster our Profile Information.
The characteristics by which we group users relate to age ranges, income ranges, education, gender, ethnicity and family composition, on the basis of the typical audience of websites they visit and content viewed.

1.3 How we obtain Usage Data and Profile Information
We collect Usage Data when your device visits our website, uses or interacts with our services (including sharing content with the ShareThis Icon), when your device visits Publishers’ websites that use ShareThis Publisher Applications, and when your device views or clicks advertisements that we serve or are served on our behalf.
We do so by using cookies placed on your browser, pixel tags, and HTTP headers (or other communication protocols).
Our use of Cookies and other Tracking Technologies
Web Environment: (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)
ShareThis uses browser cookies to “tag” visitors on the websites that use ShareThis Publisher Applications.
==========
These users are given a technical identifier, such as C62414AY9324FB5671069928026P0067.
This browser cookie tracks the user’s browsing data.
Pixel tags are then used to transfer this browsing data to ShareThis and our customers and data partners.
Cookies: Small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a browser.
==========
Cookies are installed on a browser by the publisher of a website as well by third parties who do not operate the website but whose pixel tags (described below) are found on the website.
ShareThis cookies and cookies of our customers are third party cookies, and these are installed in user browsers by the ShareThis Publisher Applications which are on Publishers’ websites.
Many browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
However, you may be able to change your browser settings to refuse third-party cookies.
==========
Check your browser’s “Help” files to learn more about handling cookies on your browser.
Pixel tags: These are small blocks of code on a webpage which read and place cookies.
When you visit a webpage, ShareThis’ pixel will see if your browser has a ShareThis cookie installed on it.
If it doesn’t, the pixel will install the cookie.
If it does, the pixel will “read” the cookie and will send us information such as the time you viewed a webpage, the type of browser used and your IP address.
This is how we learn about your interests and enable our customers to deliver targeted advertising to you.
==========
HTTP headers: These are transmitted whenever a webpage is viewed, and contain technical information required to connect your browser to the webpage.
This information may include information about the browser and the requested webpage.
ShareThis collects this information.
==========
Other Environments: (Mobile applications)
To serve ads in mobile applications identifiers may be used, such as Google Advertising ID or Apple IDFA, depending on the operating system of your mobile device.
The advertiser identifier identifies your device but not you directly and can be reset by you.
See your device manufacturer for more information or visit NAI Mobile opt-out page at https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice/.
Linking Environments: (browsers and mobile apps used)
To serve you personalized advertisements and provide a seamless online experience, third party data partners that we work with may link your identifiers on the different environments you use.
==========
We may enable the linking of our Usage Data through cookie syncing.
We do not use plain text information that may be used by ShareThis to identify you such as your name or address to operate the linking.
Our data partners may use exact linking methods by leveraging the pseudonymous data collected through our technology such as advertising partner identifiers.
You can manage cookies, change consents or opt out of personalized ads using the mechanisms described in ‘User Choices’.
1.4 How we use Usage Data and Profile Information
We use Usage Data and Profile Information to enable the delivery of targeted advertising using cookies or similar tracking technologies described above.
==========
Our customers who we share your data with may use this information to generate their own Profile Information.
They may independently gain other demographical information about you through their own cookies or web beacons and combine it with the data we provide to them.
The use of cookies and pixel tags by these third-party advertisers, publishers, and ad networks are subject to their own privacy policies.
Please refer to the ‘Recipients of Your Data’ section of this Privacy Notice for more information about who we disclose your data to.
