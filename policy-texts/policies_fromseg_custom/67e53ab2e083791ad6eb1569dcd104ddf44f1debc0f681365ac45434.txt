What information does PC World.com collect, and how is it used?
==========
PCWorld.com collects personal identifying information such as your name or e-mail address when you enter a contest or sweepstakes, or fill out a survey, and when you complete subscription registration for sites or services requiring such information.
PCWorld.com also collects billing information including credit card number and expiration date from visitors who wish to pay for PC World print magazine subscriptions.
PCWorld.com may use the information in the aggregate for marketing and promotional purposes.
PCWorld.com never shares such personal identifying information with any third party, except with the individual sponsor of a contest, promotion, or sweepstake, and only if the participant specifically asks to receive additional information from a specific sponsor and for the purposes of administering the contest and notifying the winners.
PCWorld.com may log visitors' IP addresses for the collection of aggregate information about site visitors and their interests.
PCWorld.com does not link these IP addresses to personal identifying information such as a visitor's name and/or e-mail address.
==========
What are cookies and how are they used?
PCWorld.com may place a "cookie" on the visitor's hard drive in order to facilitate a user-friendly experience.
Cookies are small files that contain information a Web site uses for tracking purposes.
==========
PCWorld.com uses the cookie information it receives to improve the efficiency of customer service for subscription-based sites, allowing subscribers to easily change addresses and add or cancel subscriptions by automatically verifying subscription status.
PCWorld.com also uses cookies to enhance site content by compiling aggregate information about what specific sections and pages users visit.
Advertisers or independent third parties who operate the servers on which the ads reside may also place cookies.
Although PCWorld.com encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, PCWorld.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties.
==========
What is PCWorld's Relationship with the Doubleclick Advertising Network?
PCWorld has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on www.pcworld.com both on the Web site itself and through our e-mail newsletters.
When DoubleClick is serving ads to the user, it is also using cookies to track certain types of non-personally identifiable information such as, a user's IP address, his or her browser version or type, operating system, service provider, and his or her local time.
For more details about the non-personally identifiable information DoubleClick collects and the opportunity to opt out of such data collection, please visit: www.doubleclick.net:8080/privacy_policy/.
Last year, DoubleClick announced the acquisition of a company called Abacus that maintains a large database of consumer spending habits.
In November 1999, DoubleClick announced the creation of Abacus Online - an attempt to marry data derived from cookies with information in the Abacus database.
As mentioned above, cookies normally are anonymous, in the sense that they only identify the computer on which they are placed, not the person using that computer.
But sites belonging to Abacus Online can ask users to log in or register for something - at which point DoubleClick can identify a user and then track him or her across other sites using DoubleClick's ad-servingsystem.
==========
Neither PCWorld.com nor PCWorld.com's parent company IDG has joined AbacusOnline.
Any pages the users calls up on PCWorld.com do not get entered into the Abacus database and will not be connected with personally-identifiable information collected either at PCWorld.com or elsewhere.
Although DoubleClick does share with PCWorld.com non-personally identifiable information such as ad clickthroughs, such information is strictly in the aggregate.
Does PCWorld.com share the information it collects with others?
PCWorld.com occasionally informs registered users and Newsletter subscribers of special deals, new products, and other third-party product and service offers that it believes they will find interesting.
PCWorld.com registered users and newsletter subscribers are given the option to choose whether they would like to receive such mailings upon registration.
At any time you can request that your information not be used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to PCWorld.com at webmaster@pcworld.com .
Under no circumstances are e-mail lists made available to known spammers, get-rich-quick sites, or pornographic sites.
PCWorld.com may also share personal information with third party intermediaries solely for the purposes of distribution and who will not store, retain, or use the information supplied to them.
These intermediaries may include subscription service bureaus, credit card companies, and banks.
==========
How can I make changes to my personal information?

For all other changes, please contact PCWorld.com at webmaster@pcworld.com .
What else should you know about your privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online-- such as a user name or e-mail address in a chat or bulletin board area, for example--you should be aware that the information provided can be collected and used by others.
==========
In addition, the PCWorld.com sites contain links to other sites not owned or operated by PCWorld.com.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites.
In some cases users may link or are referred to third party sites from PCWorld.com.
User information collected on these third party sites may be shared with PCWorld.com in aggregate form for internal tracking purposes and is not linked to any personal information.
==========
What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
