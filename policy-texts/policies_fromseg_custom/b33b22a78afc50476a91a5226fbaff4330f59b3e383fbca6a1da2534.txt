What Information Do We Collect?

(As explained above, any information from a credit report that we obtain about you is covered in our Terms of Use, and is not included in this Privacy Policy’s definition of Personal Information); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your family (“Demographic Information”).
In addition to other information Personal Information, we collect when you register, we may collect your driver's license number and social security number as a requirement of the credit bureau to verify your identity.
We use this information in order to fulfill your request for a credit score.
We may collect Personal Information through various other forms and in various places through the Services, including contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us.
Information We Collect As You Access And Use The Services
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (“Usage Information”).
==========
For example, Credit Karma automatically receives and records information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Credit Karma website.
These server logs may include information such as your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”), browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser from your computer or other device used to access the Services (any, a “Device”).
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
Credit Karma uses aggregate data collected in log files and cookies for general purposes: to enhance or otherwise improve the Services, to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, develop new services, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
These cookies and log files do not store your Personal Information, but they are tied to your Personal Information in our system.
Below are examples of methods that we may use to collect Usage Information.
In the future, other new technology and methods for collecting Usage Information may develop.
==========
Cookies.
A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Services.
A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.
Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.
If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly.
==========
Credit Karma uses cookies when you sign in, to identify you and keep track of your personal session.
All this information is securely stored, and no Personal Information is stored on your cookie.
Credit Karma uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
Session ID cookies expire upon 30 minutes of inactivity or when you close your browser whichever is shorter.
We also use a persistent cookie that remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, so that we can recognize you when you return to our web site.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file; however, because we use cookies for our sign-in functionality, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to log on to the Credit Karma web site.
Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers or tracking utility company) use cookies on our site.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
==========
Web Beacons.
Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages.
Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web or mobile page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.
Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count users of the Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie web beacons to Personal Information.
We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-persofnally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate – e.g., usage and volume statistics to enhance and improve our Web site.
Embedded Scripts.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.

Information Third Parties Provide About You
From time to time, we may supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services.
In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
==========
Information You Provide About A Third Party

What is Online Behavioral Advertising and How Can I Opt-Out?
We contract with third-party advertising networks, publishers and other entities to advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us.
Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising – which serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information.
Such ads may contain cookies that allow monitoring of websites (including our own websites that part of our own Services) and your response to our advertisements.
Cookies placed by these companies do not collect Personal Information.
We limit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts.
==========
If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of network advertising programs that use your information.
To do so, please visit: the Network Advertising Initiative industry’s opt-out page.
Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from us.
Opting out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior.
In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies.
If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again.
If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled.
Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.
==========
Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online.
However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.
These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.
The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.

Your California Privacy Rights
