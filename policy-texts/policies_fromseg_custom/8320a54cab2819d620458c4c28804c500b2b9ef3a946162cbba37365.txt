VONAGE TERMS OF SERVICE

These Terms of Service constitute the agreement ("Agreement") between Vonage America Inc. ("we," "us" or "Vonage") and the user ("you," "user" or "Customer") of Vonage's residential and small business 
communications services and any related products or services ("Service").
This Agreement governs both the Service and any devices, such as an IP phone, Vonage V-Phoneâ„¢, Multimedia Terminal Adapter, Analog Telephone 
Adapter or any other IP connection device ("Device" or "Equipment"), used in conjunction with the Service and it applies to all lines on each Vonage account.
If you purchased Equipment from a retail store, 
dealer or other provider other than Vonage, you are a "Retail Customer" for purposes of this Agreement.
BY ACTIVATING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND FULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1.
==========
EMERGENCY SERVICES - 911 DIALING 
1.1 911 Dialing.
Vonage 911 Dialing is different than traditional 911 service.
Most of our customers (other than customers using WiFi , Vonage V-Phone, Softphone or other portable Device)

have access to either basic 911 or Enhanced 911 (E911) service.
With E911 service, when you dial 911, your telephone number and registered address 
is simultaneously sent to the local emergency center assigned to your location, and emergency operators have access to the information they need to send help and call you back if necessary.
Customers in locations 
where the emergency center is not equipped to receive, capture or retain

your telephone number and address have basic 911or limited E911

.
With basic 911or limited E911, the local emergency operator answering the call may not have your call back number or your exact 
location, so you must be prepared to give them this information.
Until you give the operator your phone number, he/she may not be able to call you back or dispatch help if the call is not completed or is not forwarded, 
is dropped or disconnected, or if you are unable to speak.
==========
As additional local emergency centers become capable of receiving our customers' information, Vonage will automatically upgrade customers with basic 
911 to E911 service.
Vonage will not give you notice of the upgrade.
Certain customers do not have access to either basic 911 or E911.
If you don't have access to basic 911 or E911, your 911 call will be sent to the Vonage national emergency call center.
==========
A trained agent at 
the emergency call center will ask for the name, telephone number and location of the customer calling 911, and then contact the local emergency center for such customer in order to send help.
Examples of situations 
where 911 calls will be sent to the Vonage national emergency call center include when there is a problem validating a customer's address, the customer is identified with an international location, or the 
customer is located in an area that is not covered by the landline 911 network.
In addition, if you use certain portable Devices, your 911 calls will be routed to the Vonage 
national emergency call center.
Emergency personnel do not receive your phone number or physical location when your 911 call is routed to the Vonage national emergency call center.
You authorize us to disclose your name and address to third-parties involved with providing 911 Dialing to you, including, without limitation, call routers, call centers and local emergency centers.
==========
1.2 Notify All Users.
You should inform any household residents, guests and other third persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the Service of the important differences 
in and limitations of Vonage 911 Dialing as compared with basic 911 or E911.
The documentation that accompanies each Device that you purchase will include a sticker concerning the potential non-availability of 
basic 911 or E911 (the "911 Sticker").
It is your responsibility, in accordance with the instructions that accompany each Device, to place the 911 Sticker on each Device that you use with the Service.
If you did not 
receive a 911 Sticker with your Device, or you require additional 911 Stickers, please contact our customer care department at 1-VONAGE-HELP.
==========
1.3 Registration of Physical Location Required.
For each phone number that you use for the Service, you must register with Vonage the physical location where you will be using the Service with that 
phone number.
When you move the Device to another location, you must register your new location.
If you do not register your new location, any call you make using the 911 Dialing feature may be sent to an emergency 
center near your old address.
==========
You will register your initial location of use when you subscribe to the Service.
Thereafter, you may register a new location by following the instructions from the "911" registration 
link on your Vonage web account dashboard features page.
For purposes of the 911 Dialing feature, you may only register one location at a time for each phone line you use with the Service.
Regardless of what address 
you register for a portable device (e.g., WiFi, Vonage V-Phone or SoftPhone), emergency calls you make from these devices will be routed to the Vonage national emergency response center.
1.4 Confirmation of Activation Required.
Your 911 Dialing feature will not be activated for any phone line that you are using with the Service, unless and until you receive an email from us confirming 
that the 911 Dialing feature has been activated for that phone line.

==========

==========
During the period 
that the ports are being blocked or your Service is impeded, and unless and until the blocking or impediment is removed or the blocking or impediment is otherwise resolved, your Service, including the 911 
Dialing feature, may not function.

loss of service, including 911 Dialing, which may result.

for payment of the Service charges unless and until you disconnect the Service in accordance with this Agreement.
==========
