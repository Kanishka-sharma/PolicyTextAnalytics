PRIVACY STATEMENT















When you visit this site you may provide information on two different levels:

- Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site, and
- Personal information you knowingly give us.
We do not collect personal information about you from the website unless you provide it to us.
This means that you can visit our Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself (such as your e-mail address).
As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally.
Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

- How many people visit our site
- Which pages people visit on our site
- From which domains our visitors come
- Which browsers people use to visit our site

None of this information is associated with you as an individual.
We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.
==========
When visitors supply personal information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested).
When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this individually identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner.
For example, to hold your name, address, and phone number in our directories, or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful.
To improve the services we offer you we may decide to expand the site, we will update this privacy statement accordingly.
We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone unless (i) you specifically authorise it; (ii) it must be shared to complete a transaction that you initiated; or (iii) it is required by law, or is necessary to protect the safety of our customers, employees or property.
==========
This website may contains links to other websites.
The privacy policy for this website cannot apply to the content or the privacy practices employed at other sites and visitors should review the privacy practices at those sites.
==========
There are security measures in place that limit internal access to data stored by us.
Access is restricted to authorised personnel only and requires an employee to have a secure ID and password to access the information.
In addition, logs are reviewed regularly to spot any inconsistencies.
