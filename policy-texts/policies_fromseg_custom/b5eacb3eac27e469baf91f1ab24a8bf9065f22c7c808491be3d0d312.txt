Cookies
4.1 What are Cookies?
Cookies are little text files that are sent when visiting an internet page and are stored in a user’s browser.
In case the respective internet page is accessed once again, the user’s browser sends back the content of the cookies and, thus, allows for the recognition of the user.
Certain cookies are automatically deleted upon ending the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are saved for a set time or permanently in the user’s browser and delete themselves thereafter (so-called temporary or persistent cookies).
4.2.
==========
Which Data is Saved in the Cookies?
Cookies generally do not contain personal data, but instead only an online ID.
4.3.
==========
How can you Avoid the Usage of Cookies or Delete Cookies?
You can deactivate the storage of cookies through your browser settings and you may delete cookies that have already been saved in your browser at any time (see Technical Notes).
Please take note that this online offer might not be functional without cookies or the functionality might be reduced.
Please be further advised that refusing to allow the creation of usage profiles partially works through „opt out cookies“.
In case you delete all cookies, an objection might, under certain circumstances, no longer be considered or be valid and would have to be restated.

Web Analysis
We need statistical information about the usage of our Online Offers to design them to be user-friendlier and to perform reach measurements and market research.
For this purpose, we use the web analysis tools described in this section.
The usage profiles created by these tools using analysis cookies or by evaluating log files are not combined with personal data.
The providers of the tools (vendors) process data only as processors subject to our directives and not for their own purposes.
The tools either do not use user IP addresses at all or shorten them immediately after obtaining them.
You will find information on each tool's vendor and how you are able to object to the collection and processing of data that is done with the tool.
==========
Be advised that with regard to tools that use opt out cookies, the opt out function is related to a device or browser and is thus valid for the terminal device or browser used at this time.
In case you use several terminal devices or browsers you must opt out on every device and in every browser used.
Additionally, you can generally avoid the creation of usage profiles by generally deactivating cookie usage.
5.1.
==========
Google Analytics
Google Analytics is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").
We use Google Analytics with the additional function offered by Google to anonymize IP addresses.
While doing so, Google already shortens IPs within the EU in most cases and only does so in the United States in exceptional cases, while always saving shortened IPs only.

Right to object against direct marketing Additionally, you may at all times object to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes ("advertisement objection").

The lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal remains unaffected.
