How does Evernote respond to legal requests for my information?
We vigilantly protect the privacy of your account.
We will not disclose your information to law enforcement or other governmental authorities unless we believe it is required to comply with warrants, court orders, subpoenas, or other lawful government requests.
This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards of due process.
We narrowly interpret all information requests, and we only disclose Content in your account that is specifically responsive to a government warrant or where you have provided your explicit consent.
In accordance with our user notice policy, we will notify you if we believe we are compelled to comply with a third party’s legal demand for your information, and we routinely push back on government orders to delay user notice that we view as overly broad.
You can find more information in our current Transparency Report.
In addition, in rare cases, we may share your information as necessary to investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property or the systems on which we operate the Service, or as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
How can I manage my information stored in Evernote?
Consistent with our first law of data protection—your data is yours—in most cases, you can manage your information simply by logging into your account and editing your information directly within the Evernote service.
==========
However, if you prefer, you can contact us at compliance@evernote.com to ask us to provide access to, correct, update, or delete your personal information.
Please note that we may ask you for proof of account ownership and/or identity before fulfilling your request.
We will comply with such requests to the extent required by applicable law or the US-Swiss Privacy Shield and US-EU Privacy Shield.
==========
What happens if I want to stop using Evernote?
You can delete your Content at any time, and you can stop using the Evernote service at any time.
And as we promise in our third law of data protection, your data is portable.
You can export your notes at any time, as explained here.
==========
If you delete your Content and then sync, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service.
The Evernote service’s back-up systems may retain residual copies of your deleted Content for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.
Evernote provides you with features that allow you to communicate and collaborate with other users.
Please note that deleting your copy of these communications (such as messages) won't delete copies existing in the accounts of people you were interacting with.
==========
What happens if Evernote closes my account?
If Evernote deactivates your account due to a TOS violation, then you may contact us to request deletion of your Content, and we will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.
Where does Evernote store my information?
When you use Evernote Software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable applications, some of your data will be stored locally on that device.
==========
When you sync your computing device with the Service, that data will be replicated on servers maintained in the United States.
This means that if you store information in or submit data to the Evernote website or Evernote Software and sync such Evernote Software with the Evernote service, you acknowledge your personal information will be transmitted to, hosted, and accessed in the United States.
Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from those in the United States.
We will collect, store, and use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, wherever it is processed.
