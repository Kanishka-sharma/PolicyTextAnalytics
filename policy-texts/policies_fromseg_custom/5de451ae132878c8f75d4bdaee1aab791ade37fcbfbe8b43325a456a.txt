"Very Effective"




"All I can say is where the heck was this 
					site 6 months ago when I was WASTING money on other types of promotions?!!
I
					can't believe how effective it's been so far.
But what I really
					can't believe is that it's FREE!
I hope you don't start charging
					for it soon ... but even if you do, I'll still pay.
==========
Keep up the
					great work!"
"VERY Profitable"




"I was wondering if you own any other sites 
					or products?
TrafficSwarm rocks.
Great service, amazing setup, and VERY profitable.
If you have other stuff even half as good as this site, I'd love to get in on the action."
"Better than Paid Ads"




"Maybe I shouldn't say this to give you 
					guys any ideas, but you should start charging for this service.
It's amazingly effective
					and works better than most of my paid ads that I use in ezines.
It's so worth it.
I'm lucky I found your site."
