Yelp Privacy policy
This Privacy Policy has recently changed, and is effective as of December 13, 2007!
This website allows people to share their knowledge and insight about local businesses, services, and events with the broader community.
To accomplish this, we gather information from and about users and share it with others, as described in more detail below.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term "this website" refers to the various web pages located at the yelp.com domain,
					and excludes any web pages that might be linked to the yelp.com domain that are not owned and operated by Yelp!
Inc.
==========
The term "user" refers to a user of, or visitor to, this website.
The terms "we", "us", and "Yelp" refer to Yelp!
Inc.
The terms "you" and "your" refer to you, as a user.
==========
Your "friends" are those who you explicitly designate as friends
					by inviting them, or responding to their invitations, to share profile and review information.
By using this website, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our
					Privacy Policy.
You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.
==========
I. Information We Collect

					We collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on this
					website (your "Profile Information"), including your name, email address, and location information such as city,
					state and zip.
We also collect information in the form of the content that you submit in the course of your use of
					this website (your "Content"), such as photos, reviews, and ratings of local businesses and service providers.
Finally, we also collect other information relating to your activity on this website that you do not explicitly submit to us

II.
How We Use Your Information

						We store information about you and your use of this website, including your Content, Profile Information,
						and Nonpersonal Information.
In addition, we display your Content to other users of this website in order to
						share your knowledge and insights about local businesses, services, and events with the broader community.
Your Profile Information (excluding your email address and full last name) may also be displayed in connection
						with your Content.
Still, your friends may be able to see your full name and email address, and others may be
						able to associate your full name with your account and profile through the member search feature on this website.
We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through
						this website (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your Content).
We also use your email address to send
						you updates or news regarding this website, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing
						the "Account" tab on this website and updating your notification settings.
Additionally, we use your email
						address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).
We use Nonpersonal Information to help us diagnose problems with our server, administer this website,
						and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you.
In addition, we use Nonpersonal Information
						to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of
						the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that
						have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.
III.
Transfer of Information

						As explained in our Terms of Service, we may sell and distribute your Content together with your
						Profile Information (again, excluding your email address or full last name) to third parties who in turn may
						display or publish such information in connection with their own websites, mobile platforms, and other media,
						whether electronic in nature or otherwise.
We may disclose information about you and your use of this website if required to do so by law or in a good faith
						belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a
						search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates
						or the public.
We are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other
						similar governmental request that we receive.
==========
Further, we may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities
						or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
We reserve the right to transfer information about you and your use of this website in the event of a transfer
						of ownership of Yelp, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company.
In such an event,
						Yelp will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
IV.
==========
Others' Information

						You may choose to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be invited to create an
						account on this website and become your friend.
We use this information to contact and, if necessary,
						remind that person about the invitation.
All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further
						invitations.
==========
We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.
V. Links

						This website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation.
Except as set forth

VII.
Facebook Beacon

						Facebook Beacon is implemented on this website, allowing you to share your actions on this website
						(such as reviewing a restaurant) with others on Facebook.
In so doing, we transmit a portion of your
						Nonpersonal Information (but not your Profile Information) to Facebook, which in turn may able to associate
						that information with, and publish that information to, your profile and friends on Facebook.
We strongly
						encourage you to review your privacy settings with Facebook if you do not want to share your actions on this
						website with others on Facebook.

Controlling Your Personal Information

						You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose information about yourself in the Content that you submit
						to this website (e.g., including your name or email address in a review that you post to this website), that
						information can be collected, correlated, and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from
						others.
Such activities are beyond our control.
Please do not post any personal information on this website that
						you expect to keep private.
As a registered Yelp user, you can modify your Profile Information at any time by accessing the "Account" section of this website.
Also, upon your request, Yelp will use commercially reasonable efforts to close your account, and cease displaying
						your Profile Information and Content on this website; nevertheless, it may not be reasonably commercially possible

We limit the access to your information to those employees who need access to perform
						their job function, such as our customer service personnel.
If you have any questions about the security at our
						website, please contact us.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures
						of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be
						disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

						have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.
