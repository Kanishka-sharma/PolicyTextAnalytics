The user can access their conversations and have data communicated on logged out pages for 1 week, as long as the session isn't intentionally terminated with `Intercom('shutdown');`, which usually happens on logout.
==========
We may use other similar technologies too, like web beacons, tags, pixels, clear gifs, caching and local browser storage.
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors.
We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
==========
Their function is to provide us with statistical information about site traffic and how people navigate through our site, as well as to facilitate marketing and interest-based advertising.
Web beacons are typically transparent graphic images placed on a site.
Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to measure the actions of visitors on websites and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
==========
We and our marketing and advertising partners may use web beacons to obtain information such as the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page.
We may also use web beacons in marketing emails sent by our system.
If you receive the HTML formatted version of such emails and your email is configured to download images, a record of whether or not you open the email (and, if you open the email, how frequently you open it) will be saved with your subscriber history.
Your engagement with the content of the communication (such as which links you click on) will also be recorded.
We also use caching and local storage in your browser to store personalization settings such as your language and which tabs you were last viewing inside our product.
This allows us to enhance your experience and resume sessions where you left off.
==========
We may use this information to give us an indication of the popularity of content and to help us make decisions about future content and formatting.
We may also use the information to publish more content relevant to users in future issues and to unsubscribe recipients who haven't opened our emails for a period of time.
==========
Third party cookies
Some cookies that have been set on our Websites are not set on a first party basis by Intercom.
The Websites can be embedded with content from third parties to serve advertising.
These third party service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser.
Third party service providers control many of the performance and functionality, advertising, marketing and analytics cookies described above.
We do not control the use of these third party cookies as cookies can only be accessed by the third party that originally set them.
For a list of third party cookies used in our Websites and why see this table.
Controlling cookies and similar technologies - E.U users
You can set and change your preferences, at any time, by clicking here.
Blocking and disabling cookies and similar technologies
Wherever you're located you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar technologies, but this action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not be able to fully utilize all of its features and services.
You should also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g. saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser.
Different browsers make different controls available to you.
==========
Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
Targeted advertising
You can opt-out of interest-based advertising facilitated by the cookies on our Websites by opting out of advertising cookies, by clicking here.
In addition, you can opt-out of interest-based advertising from participating members of the following advertising industry associations:
Not all companies that serve targeted ads participate in these opt-out programs, so even after opting-out, you may still receive some cookies and interest-based advertisements from other companies.
If you opt-out of targeted ads, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.
You can also use your mobile device settings to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.
==========
You will need to apply all of the settings described above on each device on which you want the settings to be applied.
