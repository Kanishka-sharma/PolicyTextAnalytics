Privacy Policy

Thinkific respects your privacy.
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide it, such as when you provide email contact information to subscribe to the Thinkific email list newsletter, send feedback to Thinkific, register for one of Thinkificâ€™s courses or respond to a survey.
If you voluntarily provide your email address or other contact information, we might also use it to inform you of changes to Thinkific, to survey you about your use or opinion of Thinkific, or to ask for your support.
At your request, we will remove your contact information from our files.
==========
We do not make your contact information or any other personally identifiable information available to anyone outside Thinkific or its service providers (who use the information only for authorized Thinkific purposes) unless we are legally required to do so.
In addition to the above, we collect certain anonymous (non-personally identifiable) information to help us improve the Thinkific web site and to evaluate the access and use of Thinkific materials and the impact of Thinkific on the worldwide educational community:


We collect information you provide about your use of and satisfaction with Thinkific through email you send us, through the Thinkific feedback form, and through Thinkifc surveys, whether or not you voluntarily include your contact information.
We may use web analysis tools that are built into the Thinkific web site to measure and collect anonymous session information.
We also use "cookies" to improve your Thinkific web experience and to collect anonymous information about how you use Thinkific.
However, cookies are not required for Thinkific use.
If your browser is configured not to accept cookies, you will still be able to access Thinkific and its content.
When we report information about Thinkific access, use, and impact, we report aggregate, non-personally identifiable data.
Occasionally, we report quoted feedback from users.
We do not attribute feedback to specific individuals unless we obtain permission to use that person's name along with the feedback.
