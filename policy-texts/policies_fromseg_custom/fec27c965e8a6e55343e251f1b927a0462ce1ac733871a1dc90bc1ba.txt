We receive and may store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way (including by connecting to Bleacher Report through a third-party service).
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
The personal information we collect includes:
* Registration: In order for you to use certain Bleacher Report services, such as submitting new articles to the Site, you must complete a registration form including your full name and email address, or connect with us through a third-party service, which will provide us with information about you from your account with that service as that service may permit.

Bleacher Report cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.
==========
You may choose to disable or  reject cookies when using the Service, but you may not be able to access some of Bleacher Report's most attractive features.
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers).
Bleacher Report has no access to or control over these cookies.
