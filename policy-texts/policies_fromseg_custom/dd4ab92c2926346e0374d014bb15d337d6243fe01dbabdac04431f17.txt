 The Electronic Frontier Foundation
eTRUST On-Site Information Page

This site is a pilot member (and co-founder) of the eTRUST program.
The 
eTRUST program is a global initiative for establishing consumer trust 
and confidence in electronic transactions.
Our on-site coordinator, Stanton McCandlish, has insured that this site
complies with the basic eTRUST guidelines, and has implemented
the eTRUST Trustmarks where appropriate throughout the site.
==========
As a member of the eTRUST pilot, Electronic Frontier Foundation has 
agreed to
the following basic guidelines:

It will explain and summarize its general information gathering
practices below:
The Electronic Frontier Foundation "EFFWeb" site generally
 stores no information about its visitors, with the exceptions of:

 basic logging for site stats (records site name, but not user ID)
  information provided by users who fill out our online membership, 
      order, guestbook, or contest forms (this information is used ONLY for 
      1-to-1 communication between EFF and the member/customer unless the 
      member/customer permits otherwise.
This information is not used by 
      EFF for general marketing purposes).
Under no circumstances does EFF compile "audit trails" of which users are 
 browsing what pages, and under no circumstances will EFF sell, rent, 
 loan or give personally identifiable user information to marketeers.
Here are some examples of what our logs 
 contain.
EFF's membership form allows members to voluntarily permit EFF to share 
 their contact information with other similar organizations.
This is the 
 full extent of 3rd-party use of information about EFFweb users,
 and the default is "no" - you must directly give us permission before any 
 such use will be made of your information.
==========
In the event that a user-input form is processed off-site, that form will
have a "3rd Party Exchange" trust mark, even if our own policy is 1-to-1, 
since we cannot be 100% certain that the off-site partner company is not
doing anything with the data other than processing it for us.
Electronic Frontier Foundation will not monitor personal communications
of users on this site

Above and beyond these requirements, EFF does not make use of cookies or 
other user-tracking software.
==========
We only do aggregate, anonymous, site usage 
statistics.
Electronic Frontier Foundation will not display or make available 
personally identifiable information which is not publicly available

Above and beyond these requirements, EFF does not display or make 
available any personally identifiable information about EFFweb users, 
even if it is publicly available from other sources, without explicit 
permission from the user.
==========
The user can request to update or remove personal information
by contacting the eTRUST Pilot Site coordinator.
In EFF's case, the only personal information collected is
  for membership and other direct EFF-to-you purposes.
Please contact
  our membership coordinator, Laura Pirri, membership@eff.org, to update or
  remove your information from any database or records here.
You may 
  also write to Laura to have us change your preferences for whether or
  not info you have given us can be shared with other organizations.
==========
The Overall Mark



The overall mark for this site is No Exchange.
This Trustmark
applies throughout the site except where otherwise denoted.
The eTRUST Trustmarks you may see throughout this site represent
various levels of privacy in accordance with the eTRUST guidelines.
The No Exchange Trustmark insures anonymous usage, anonymous
transactions, anonymous chat and anonymous tracking.
The 1 to 1 Exchange Trustmark insures that the services will 
not disclose
individual or transactional data to third parties.
The 3rd Party Exchange trustmark informs the 
user that the services
will be disclosing information with third parties.
