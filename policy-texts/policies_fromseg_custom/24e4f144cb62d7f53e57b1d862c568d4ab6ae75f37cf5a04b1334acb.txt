The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member name.
If other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews.

We may use your public content to personalize site views and identify or feature popular members.
For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members.

Email Tools.
==========
If you send emails to a recipient through our site, they will receive your email address and any personal message you include.
Although we do not retain in any easily retrievable way the addresses you email, these emails are not private communications.
You may not use our email tools to send spam or content that violates the User Agreement.
Anti-Spam Policy.
Shopping.com does not tolerate spam.
We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party.
This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet.
If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact our Privacy Department and we will investigate.

==========

However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
