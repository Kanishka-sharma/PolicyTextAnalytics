Esri values the privacy of our customers, distributors, and business partners, as it is a principal component of establishing trust.
Esri has created a general company Privacy Statement and a supplementary Products & Services Privacy Statement to ensure our customers receive the level of privacy they deserve and expect.
The privacy statements describe how Esri collects data and uses information you provide to us, and are independently validated.
Esri works diligently to ensure we provide a trustworthy environment for our customers; therefore, we are continuously making new privacy and security advancements to ensure we meet evolving requirements around the world.
The most recent examples of this are the expansion of the supplemental ArcGIS Online privacy statements to cover a broader base across Esri Products & Services while also updating privacy statements to be in line with Privacy Shield.
Esri is committed to compliance with the European privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which went into enforcement May 2018.
The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations outside the European Union that process personal data related to the offering of goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that monitor the behavior of EU citizens within the European Union.
==========
Privacy & Security presentations from the 2018 User Conference addressing our GDPR efforts will be posted to the Trust Center after the conference.
We will also be releasing an ArcGIS GDPR/Privacy Best Practices whitepaper soon to help our customers use our products in a manner that supports them meet their GDPR obligations.
We have posted to the Trust Center an Esri signed Data Processing Addendum (DPA) that our customers can sign.

Esri Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement
The Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement applies to the Esri Products, Services and related offerings that display or link to the "Products & Services" notice.
Esri established the Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement in order to clarify that the use of information to which it may be provided access in order to deliver Product & Services, is more limited than the use of information covered by the general Esri Privacy Statement.
Key offerings that fall within the scope of Products & Services include ArcGIS Online, Esri Managed Cloud Services, Customer Support, and Professional Service engagements.
==========
Customers who utilize organization (cost based) accounts, of Products & Services such as ArcGIS Online, expect a higher level of privacy assurance which is reflected in the Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement, whereas consumers of public accounts are provided the privacy assurance level of the Esri Privacy Statement.
Esri's marketing sites and other public websites are governed by the general Esri Privacy Statement.
The Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement provides clarity concerning:
The importance of the privacy of our Customer Data to be treated as confidential
The collection and handling of Support Data when engaging with Esri for support
Not storing payment instrument number information within Esri systems from credit cards
The requirement of cookies for many products when non-anonymous access is required
Ability to configure on-premises products to not collect or transmit data to Esri
ArcGIS Online and EMCS Advanced Plus only store Customer Data in the contiguous US
Constraints in place for limiting disclosure of data
In the event of a conflict between the general Esri Privacy Statement and the more restrictive terms of the Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement, with regard to data provided to Esri in connection with use of the "Products & Services" the Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement will control
ArcGIS Online Privacy Assurance
ArcGIS Online privacy assurance is boosted by the Products & Services Privacy Statement Supplement as well as the following additional items:
Our cloud infrastructure providers are ISO 27018 (Cloud Privacy) compliant and Esri has executed EU Model Clause addendums with them
Security and privacy assurance of FedRAMP third-party validation and mapping to ISO27k
Customers maintain full ownership of their customer content
Customer may choose not to store personal information in ArcGIS Online
Customers can choose to limit storage of personal information to their own infrastructure with a hybrid deployment model
