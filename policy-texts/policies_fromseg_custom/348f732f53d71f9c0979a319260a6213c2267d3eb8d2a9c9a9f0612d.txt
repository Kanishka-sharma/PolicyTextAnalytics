Privacy Policy
Hoover's, Inc., is serious about protecting your privacy -- whether you are a subscriber or a visitor.
We use information collected about you only to process and bill orders and to make Hoover's Online a more useful and valuable service.
Hoover's strives to respect the privacy of those who visit or become subscribers of the Hoover's Online Web site.
The policy listed below is applicable to Hoover's Online and other sites on the World Wide Web that are maintained and operated by Hoover's, Inc.
==========
Your Information: What, How, and Why?
Subscribers and Visitors
In order to process your request, we need to know contact information such as your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, job and job title and method of payment.
All of this information is not shared with third parties, except for: 1) special promotions of Hoover’s or its partners you have requested to be shown; 2) where a third party performs services on behalf of Hoover’s and has agreed to keep such information confidential; 3) the aggregate use of the information of multiple Hoover’s subscribers and visitors where individual personal information is not disclosed; and 4) advertising promotions.
Hoover's shares Web site usage information about subscribers and visitors with a third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting advertising campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.
For this purpose, some of the pages you visit on our Web site use pixel tags (also called clear gifs).
==========
Hoover’s also uses your information to market its services and to gain feedback on potential new services.
Newsletters
As a subscriber or visitor to a Hoover's site, you may voluntarily sign up for one of our free newsletters.
When you sign up for one of the newsletters, we ask for contact information, such as your name and e-mail address, and job and job title information, which are used to help us understand our audience.
This information is for Hoover's use only and is not disclosed to any other party except in aggregate form.
Additionally, if you decide that you do not wish to receive a newsletter or update any longer, you may cancel it.
Surveys
Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our Hoover's Online visitors.
From time to time, we request subscribers' or newsletter subscribers' input in order to evaluate potential features and services.
The decision to answer a survey is completely yours.
We use information gathered from surveys to improve our service.
==========
How Do We Protect Subscriber Information Once We Have It?
All information is stored on a secure server.
Hoover's uses Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server for our Web site.
Browsers will encrypt the contents of the subscription form before sending it to our server.
Please remember that many services and transactions are performed by our business partners.
Our privacy policy and our security or common practices do not apply to other companies.

Cookies You Can't Eat
What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?
A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser.
Hoover's uses cookies to store some personal preferences for your future visits.
Cookies allow Hoover's to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site is more personalized and productive.
You'll find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in much the same way we use them here at Hoover's.
==========
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.
In the course of serving advertisements, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to Hoover’s and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that might be of interest to you.

If you take advantage of a special promotion, you are authorizing Hoover's to provide only that partner with your relevant information needed to fulfill the offer.
In order to make Hoover's Online a more valuable product for our subscribers and visitors, we also collect and analyze statistical information.
From time to time, we share this information in aggregate with third parties.
