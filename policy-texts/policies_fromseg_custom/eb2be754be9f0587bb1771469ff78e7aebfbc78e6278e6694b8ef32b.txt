– Privacy Policy


        Atlassian* adheres to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable
        information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, and/or other identifiable information).
Gathering and Use of Information


            We will never share your information with third parties outside Atlassian unless you give express permission
            for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.
In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable
            information.
This could be in connection with the following:
        

software evaluation registration
subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters)
purchase transactions
content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting
contest or sweepstakes registration
bug submission
feature request


            We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
            software, which encrypts information you input.
==========
If you chose to have a relationship with Atlassian, such as a contractual or other business relationship
            or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
Employees of Atlassian or approved contractors or resellers have access to personally identifiable
            customer information.
All employees, contractors, and resellers are legally bound to uphold this policy
            and observe your right to privacy and confidentiality.
We will never share your information with third
            parties outside Atlassian unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required
            to do so under applicable law.
If you call us to find out whether another person or party within your organisation has evaluated or purchased
            our software, we may disclose that information, but you will be required to demonstrate proof that you belong
            to the organisation that you are inquiring about.
==========
Atlassian will not willfully disclose your personal information
            to any third party without first receiving your permission.
As an international company, Atlassian maintains databases in Australia and the United States.
Any information
            that you submit to us via our Websites may be sent electronically to a database maintained in either country.
We protect your privacy around the world by ensuring that this Website and all Atlassian networks adhere to
            data-protection principles described in this page.
==========
We store all email transactions and strive to keep records of phone calls with customers, partners, and
            software evaluators so we have a history of our interactions that can be used for Pre-Sales Support and Technical Support.
We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location,
            position, tool use, etc.) If the online survey collects contact data such as your e-mail address
            (although generally they do not), we will use that data to send you further information only if the
            form specifically asks for your permission and you give it.
==========
You are free to revoke any such
            permission at any time.
The Atlassian family of websites contain links to other sites.
Atlassian is not responsible for
            the privacy practices or the content of these linked websites.
You can opt out of receiving e-mail communications from Atlassian at any time.
You only need to e-mail
            us to have your name and details removed from our e-mail list or registration database.
==========
Although opt-out
            requests are usually processed immediately, please allow five (5) business days for
            the removal to be processed.
Transactions are recorded, including, but not limited to, when a user downloads software, purchases, logs
            into his/her account, or generates a software license key.
We do not store any credit card or bank account
            information on any online systems that can be accessed remotely.
