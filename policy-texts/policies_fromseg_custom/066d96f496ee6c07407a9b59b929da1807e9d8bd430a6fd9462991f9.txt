WHY DO WE COLLECT DATA?
==========
Captify is a specialist in displaying advertisements that are relevant to you.
Our aim is to enhance your online advertising experience by showing you adverts for products we think you might like.
By way of a practical example, you search for a product online, explore various options and continue to surf the web.
As you later surf the web, Captify shows you adverts that are related to the product you searched for.
With Captify’s service, the digital advertisements you see online or in apps will be more relevant to you than the ads you would see without Captify.
In order for us to process your data, you normally will have already consented to data processing by accepting cookies or similar technologies from one of the publishers that participates in our programmes.
You can change your preferences at any time as set out in Section 9 below.
We and our publisher partners and advertising clients also have a legitimate interest, which does not conflict with your legal rights, in processing data for presenting adverts that are more relevant to what you search for, analysing trends and browsing behaviour, and optimizing website and mobile app experiences.
4.
WHAT TYPES OF DATA DO WE PROCESS?
Captify collects data via anonymous “cookies” or similar identification technologies placed on your device via our partners’ websites or apps.
==========
This allows us to show you advertising that is more relevant and interesting to you.
We do not at any point collect contact information such as your name, address, phone number, email, address, credit card information, or anything else that can allow us or our clients to contact you directly.
There is no way for Captify to know who you are.
We only collect data from our trusted data partners and do not collect data from public sources.
5.
CAPTIFY COMMITMENTS
Captify has partnered with the following organisations to ensure that all information is properly regulated and that you have the greatest amount of control over what information you are providing:

==========
COOKIES
A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s device for record-keeping purposes.
There are two types of cookies:

Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate on websites.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
==========
Persistent cookies are used to run our technology as they enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our partners’ websites.
Persistent cookies remain on your device for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your browser’s help section.
Our partners’ advertisements are displayed on many websites and apps of our partner network.
==========
These publishers may also place cookies on your device (or use similar identification methods).
This is so that our technologies can recognise that Captify has a personalised advertisement available for your device.
You can find out more information about cookies here.
To manage cookies from Captify, please see our section 9 below.

HOW DOES CAPTIFY USE DATA?
We collect only anonymous data through cookies or App identifiers that record:

Events related to your activity on the partner’s website/app (such as the number of pages/products viewed or your searches made on the partner’s website/app).
Events related to the Captify ad serving activity such as the number of ads displayed to you or whether you interacted with those ads.
We do not collect personal information.
We do not know who you are.
We do not know your address, your place of work, your date of birth, your email address or any other personally identifiable information about you.
==========
We do not collect special categories of information (such as your religion, your political opinions, your health etc.), although if you search for related terms we may also receive that information.
The information collected aims to increase the relevancy of the ads being displayed to you.
We do not create segments that specifically target people age 13 or under.
==========
We do not process any information which could be used by Captify, directly or indirectly, with the help of a third party or otherwise, to determine the identity of users.
The data we collect is also used for reporting purposes, to give our clients and partners more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns and websites, and to improve performance over time.
In compliance with the best industry standards, we also use IP addresses for purposes such as fraud detection to help alert us to situations which could not have been caused by human behaviour, such as a massive amount of clicking in a limited period of time.
8.
==========
HOW LONG DOES CAPTIFY KEEP DATA?
We never retain data longer than necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, i.e. to serve relevant ads and help with website and app optimisation.
We delete all data that is more than 15 months old.
9.
==========
WHO RECEIVES YOUR DATA?
For our clients, we provide insights in the form of aggregated data, which does not include any individual personal data.
We provide data to other companies in our corporate group and technical service providers inside and outside the EU that require access to data in order to assist us in providing our services.
In each case we have in place safeguards that enable these transfers to happen in a way that ensures that data is handled in accordance with similar standards to those applicable in the EU which include: the EU-US Privacy Shield for transfers to business partners in the US; and European Commission approved standard contract clauses for other transfers outside the EU.
==========
A copy of these documents can be provided upon request.
If any authority, police force or regulator requested data from us, then we would normally comply with such request without having to notify you or other users.

HOW CAN YOU MANAGE COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES?
If you no longer want to receive Captify personalised banners, you can manage this directly as explained here.
Please note that this procedure will block ads that are displayed by Captify.
Manage your choices here:  Your ad choices
This does not affect email, telephone, direct mail or any other type of marketing, and if you wish to stop receiving those types of materials then you should contact the providers separately.
Please note that this will not block ads that are displayed on the websites you visit, it will simply stop you receiving advertising that has been tailored to your interests.
This choice relies on a cookie, so if you wipe all your cookies then we will no longer know that you have opted out.
The same applies if you use a different web browser, or use a new device.
==========
You can also block Captify’s service by visiting the IAB choices platform.
Please note that these platforms allow you to choose not to receive interest-based advertising delivered by registered members.
You may still see personalised ads from other providers and should also contact them as needed.
==========
Your online choices:  More info
You can configure your web browser to remove cookies by following the directions provided in your browser’s “help” section.
PLEASE NOTE: when you manage choices in these ways, a cookie will be set in your browser.
We must maintain the cookie on your browser in order to recognise you as a visitor that has made this choice.
You must do so again if you clear that cookie from your browser, use a different web browser, or use a new device.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us as set out in Section 1 above.
If you decide not to accept cookies from a site, it is possible that in addition to not receiving personalised ads, some other functionalities and content on that site might not work as intended.
11.
==========
WHAT ARE YOUR OTHER RIGHTS?
In accordance with the EU’s GDPR, which Captify supports and complies with, you have additional rights in relation to data that we process about you i.e.

To ask for access to it;
To ask for errors in it to be corrected;
To ask for it to be erased (the “right to be forgotten”);
If not erased, then to ask us to restrict its processing;
To object to its processing for specific purposes;
To ask for a copy to take to another service provider.
Where we process any data based on consent that you have given in the past, then you are always allowed to withdraw your consent at any time (though the processing that took place before withdrawal will still be legal).
The main ways to do this are (1) to manage online choices as set out above; or (2) by contacting the publisher sites where you have previously given your consent.
==========
As indicated above, Captify does not process contact or ID data such as names or emails and so, while we will always investigate any request thoroughly, it may be that we either need additional information from you in order to understand whether or not we are processing any data relating to you, or we may not technically be able to locate it.
We, including through our Data Protection Officer as indicated in Section 1 above, are always available to help resolve any issues or doubts you may have in relation to processing of your data.
If you believe that your rights have not been respected at any time then you also have a right to complain to the Supervisory Authority in your country (also known as Data Protection Authorities or, in the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office) to ask them for a resolution.
