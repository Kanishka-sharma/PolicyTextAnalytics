Collection and Use of Data via adjust’s technology
adjust provides mobile analytics and attribution services to mobile app providers.
In connection with these services, we may collect, process and use certain non-personal data from the users of these mobile apps, as further described hereafter.
Collection and use of non-personal data
Our technology may collect some of the following non-personal data: 

Anonymized (hashed) IP address
Anonymous identifiers such as the ID for Advertising for iOS (IDFA), Google Advertising ID or similar identifiers
Installation and first opening of an app on your mobile device
User interactions within an app (e.g. in-app purchases, registration)
Information regarding which advertisements the user has seen or clicked on

adjust uses the collected data for providing mobile analytics and attribution services to its customers, and thereby allows its customers to track marketing performance, to match users to their campaigns and to understand how they engage with the customer’s app.
==========
Furthermore, adjust enables its customers to track the user’s interactions in their apps in real time in order to see how their users engage over their full lifetime.
The collected non-personal data is therefore used in order to analyze the performance of marketing campaigns and to provide performance reports to adjust’s customers.
adjust does not combine the collected non-personal data with any other data that would enable adjust to personally identify the user.
Opt-Out
Any information collected via the adjust technology is owned and controlled by the individual customer who has implemented the adjust technology into their mobile app.
It is not technically possible for us to disable tracking for an individual user.
Users who want to opt out of being tracked by a particular publisher, ad network, or by an advertiser’s ads therefore must contact these companies directly to opt out.
