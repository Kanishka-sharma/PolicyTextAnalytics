We collect data through our sharing tools from our extensive publisher network, we apply data science to the data and we process it to our downstream partners for insights and targeting activities.
About ShareThis Social Sharing Tools
ShareThis provides a customizable social sharing tool, making sharing online content simple.
You can easily share anything on the web with your friends on social sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Email, Digg, Reddit and more through one tool (“ShareThis Icon”).
In addition to the sharing service offered directly to you, our technology also allows us to gather information regarding the browsing and sharing from those websites that use our ShareThis Icon or our advertising technology (“Publishers”).
==========
This enables ShareThis, Publishers, advertisers, and data partners to facilitate the delivery of relevant, targeted advertising, analytics, and data modeling based on this social sharing (collectively “ShareThis Publisher Applications”).
You can recognize the websites which use the ShareThis Publisher Applications by the ShareThis Icon on the website.
Without identifying who you are by name, email or phone number we aim to display to you products and/or services that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing and/or sharing behavior,.
This is often called interest-based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”).
