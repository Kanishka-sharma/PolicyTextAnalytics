For more information, see Section 9, entitled “Your Legal Rights”.

Typically, this will include where we contact you during our business activities, or in relation to marketing where you have bought a product or service from us.

PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Profiling
Hybrid Theory may use your data to create profiles of your interests, in addition to matching them to existing profiles or “segments”, which will allow us to target you with advertising that is useful and relevant.
==========
As part of this, we collect Browsing Data and Inferred Data from the sources listed above, which is typically related to your online web activity.
Analysing this data allows us to understand your interests, and match these to “segmented profiles” or “model audiences” based around categories of hobbies or features common to a group of online web users.
This allows us to then show you relevant advertisements that appeal to your user group.
==========
This is performed using an automated technological process using artificial intelligence (AI) developed and managed by our Data Engineering team and is then passed on to our third-party partners to ensure that this information is used to target appropriate advertisements to you.
As part of this process, we take steps to exclude any categories or labels related to Special Category Data or children’s data being used to collect or generate such profiles.
We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so.
We have also identified what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS (GDPR and DPA)
Under certain circumstances, where you are a UK or EU citizen, you may exercise rights under the GDPR or DPA in relation to your personal data, upon request.
In most cases, the website publisher or third-party partners that originally collected the information from you, such as through a Cookie, will be better placed to help you comply with such rights.
Your rights include:

Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “subject access request”).
This enables you to receive information about, and potentially a copy of, the personal data we or our third-party partners hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it
Request rectification of the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us
Request erasure of your personal data.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data in certain circumstances, for example, such as where i) you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below); ii) we may have processed your information unlawfully or iii) we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law, amongst other situations; iv) processing the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest, in addition to objection to the creation of profiles about you.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
You should exercise this by contacting us at privacy@hybridtheory.com or responding to the marketing email you received by clicking the relevant opt-out link or replying to the email with “OPT-OUT”
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to data that you or our third-party partners have provided to us and does not apply to Inferred Data used to create profiles

What we may need from you
To allow you to exercise these rights, we must be able to identify any personal data, including Online Identity, Browsing and potentially Inferred Data that relates to you.
When making a request, we may ask that you provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
We request that you kindly describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
When you contact us, we may also require you to provide us with your Cookie IDs, in which case we will give you guidance on how to generate this for us.
==========
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests.
In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
==========
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.
Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS (CCPA)
Under certain circumstances, where you are a California resident, you have rights under the CCPA in relation to your personal data, upon request.

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page link here https://www.hybridtheory.com/do-not-sell
Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services



However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
==========

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

CCPA METRICS
Under Section 999.317(g) of the California Civil Code of Regulations (pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018 (“CCPA”)), as a business that has the potential to receive the personal data of more than 10 million California consumers, Hybrid Theory are required to report, by July 1 every year, to the metrics on the individual rights requests we have received under the CCPA for the previous calendar year.
Hybrid Theory received a total of 33 data protection requests under the CCPA from the year from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020, out of 46 data protection requests in total.
==========
Our request breakdown is as follows, including composite/combined requests received:



Relevant CCPA Metric
Requests received
Requests complied with
Requests denied
Mean number of days within which the business substantively responded to requests (days)


The number of requests to know that the business received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied

The following definitions apply:

Receipt of a request: Where Hybrid Theory receives a request from a purported individual that makes it clear they are attempting to exercise their rights under the CCPA, including to know or delete personal information or opt-out of sale.
Complying with a request: This involves responding to or actioning an individual’s request.
This includes providing or deleting an individual’s personal information, or respecting their right to opt-out, at their request.
==========
Additionally, where Hybrid Theory have replied to an individual to confirm that we do not have any data on them, this counts as ‘complying’ with a request.
Where we direct the individual (who wants only to opt-out to cookies) to our cookie banner, this counts as complying with a request.
Denial of a request: ‘Denial’, in full or part, of a request, is where Hybrid Theory is not required to comply with a request, and therefore do not do so.
This occurs where either the individual is not able to verify their identity (in most cases providing their cookie ID or real-world identification) or we rely on legal exceptions (such as the request is excessive, or the information is subject to legal professional privilege).
We will always notify the individual to let them know why we can’t comply with their request.
