When you capture imagery and submit it to the Matterport Portal (as described in the Matterport Portal Subscription Agreement), we may collect personal information which is depicted within the imagery you submit.
==========
We do use this information in aggregated form for analytics and machine learning, but the results of these activities do not contain or disclose any personal information that is identifiable to you.
We do not use this incidental information for any other purpose, but this information may be publicly displayed if you choose to display the underlying imagery publicly through the Matterport Portal.
If you do not wish to publicly display personal information depicted in the imagery you submit, you should either refrain from capturing such personal information in your imagery or designate the imagery as “private” in your Matterport Portal account.
For additional information on designating your imagery as “public” or “private”, restricting third parties from editing or re-sharing your imagery, and the consequences of archiving your imagery, deleting your imagery and/or terminating your account, please also see the Matterport Portal Subscription Agreement.

If you have questions about type and purpose of cookies (our own and third party) that are used in connection with our Services, you may contact us by e-mail at info@matterport.com.

California privacy disclosures.
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time.
We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
==========
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions.
In general, subject to certain exceptions, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide, free of charge, a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
