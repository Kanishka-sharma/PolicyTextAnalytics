The aim of this Privacy Policy is to inform users of how we collect and use certain information as a result of the mobile advertising services provided by Devego S.A. / Jampp (hereinafter “Jampp”) to its customers.
This Privacy Policy governs our use and disclosure of information that we collect when you visit a website that directly or indirectly uses the Jampp services, or view advertisements we serve.
This Privacy Policy does not otherwise apply to the practices of other websites, such as those of our publishers and advertiser clients, or other services or companies that we do not own, manage or control.
We do not control the privacy practices of such third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties when you use their services.
Our Business
Jampp technology powers advertisements that can appear on web sites and applications on mobile phones or other devices connected to the mobile internet.
You may interact directly with our servers (for example, when you click on an ad) or indirectly via the mobile web site or application that displays the ads.
Purpose of data collection
With each interaction between your device and our ad servers we collect certain information, which we will describe below.
We use this information in order to help deliver more interesting and relevant ads to you, in order to provide to our customers and partners reports that contain aggregated data (for instance, the number of ads delivered each day, the number of clicks on those ads, and so on), in order to analyze trends, and in order to perform fraud detection.
==========
Information collected
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you.
We do, however, record and use information that is not personally identifiable, including but not limited to the following:

the IP address of your device on the mobile internet, to help us identify your mobile operator, connection type, and other details;
the ‘user agent’ of your browser or application, and other relevant request headers, to help us identify your device type;
the date and time of the ad request or interaction; and
a unique identifier, such as an HTTP cookie or device identifier, that enables us not to show you the same ad over and over again.
We also encourage (but do not require) our publishers to share with us additional information that is not personally identifiable information, but that we may use in order to improve ad relevance.
==========
This data may include:

your age or age range, if known to the publisher;
your gender, if known to the publisher; and
your geographic location, if known to the publisher.
Use of information
We may use this non personally identifiable information along with our technology in order to provide ads that are likely to be more interesting and more relevant to mobile device users to target advertising (this is also known as behavioral, or interest-based advertising).
However, at this moment we do not run behavioral advertising campaigns.
==========
We sometimes use cookies or device identifiers to help us track whether you complete specific actions on an advertiser’s mobile web site or application, as this is needed for analytical purposes, and in order to monitor the performance of our ads.
These cookies or identifiers use the domain name jampp.com and expire within 365 days, and are never placed if you don’t interact with our ads (for example, if you only see the ads).
We may share this non personally identifiable information with clients, vendors, and other companies with whom we conduct business.
We may also use some of this data to provide interest-based advertising.
As a general rule, we don’t collect personally identifiable information.
