What Personal Information do we collect via the Axonix service?
Our service uses information passed to us from devices browsing on apps or websites using the Axonix service or from third party data providers.

Additionally, we may receive the geo-location of a device (using GPS or other geo-location data), either from available sources (e.g. the geo-location of the IP address of the device) or when location services have been consented for and enabled for the mobile app or website that uses the Axonix Services.
Where we utilize data sourced through third party providers, we ensure that these companies have rigorous privacy policies in place that are at least as robust as our own, and that the data they provide to Axonix complies with these privacy policies.
