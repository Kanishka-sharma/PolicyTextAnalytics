By using our web site or other services, you

Significance of Ratings
 "Customer Certified" ratings reflect the aggregated responses of actual customers-typically 
  many thousands of consumers--surveyed at the point-of-sale for each online store.
As such, these ratings are informative for those wishing to use them, but they 
  do not guarantee any level of performance by an online merchant or other third 
  party in any given transaction.
"Member Ratings" reflect the aggregated responses of hundreds or thousands 
  of actual consumers who are members of BizRate.com's Online Research Panel of 
  actual online buyers.
Again, as such, these ratings are informative for those 
  wishing to use them, but they do not guarantee any level of performance by an 
  online merchant or other third party in any given transaction.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, BIZRATE.COM 
  DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT 
  TO SUCH INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
  TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, as 
  well as representations and warranties of title, non-infringement, freedom from 
  computer viruses, worms, and other operating problems, and implied warranties 
  arising from course of dealing or course of performance.
In addition, since 
  BizRate.com cannot verify all information provided by online merchants and other 
  third parties, BizRate.com does not represent or warrant that the information 
  accessible via our web site or other services is always accurate, complete or 
  current.
==========
Among other things, due to the dynamic nature of online shopping, all 
  information regarding the price, description and availability of, and any discounts, 
  offers, promotions and coupons relating to, any product or service offerings 
  available on our web site or through our other services is subject to change 
  without notice.
BIZRATE.COM SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY TO

==========
Liability Limitations
 In no event shall BizRate.com or its affiliates or agents (the "BizRate.com 
  Parties") be liable, whether in an action under contract, negligence, or any 
  other theory, arising out of or in connection with the use, inability to use, 
  or performance of the information, services, products, and materials available 
  from this web site or through our other services, in an amount greater than 
  the lower of (i) the price of the merchandise or service involved in the transaction 
  or proposed transaction as to which one or more BizRate.com Parties is held 
  to be negligent or otherwise responsible, or (ii) if no such merchandise or 
  service is involved, or if the value thereof would exceed $1,000, then a maximum 
  liability limitation of $1,000 in the aggregate.
You and we agree that this 
  is a fair allocation of risk based upon the manner and cost by which BizRate.com's 
  services are provided to you, taking into account your ability to take other 
  measures or consult other resources in connection with purchasing goods and 
  services online.
==========
FURTHERMORE, IN NO EVENT SHALL BIZRATE.COM OR ITS AFFILIATES 
  OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, 
  EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, even if we have been previously advised 
  of the possibility of such damages.
These limitations shall apply notwithstanding 
  to any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.
Because some jurisdictions 
  do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion 
  or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above 
  limitations may not apply to you.

Third-Party Sites
 Our web site or other services may include links to other sites on the Internet 
  that are owned and operated by online merchants and other third parties.
You

Dispute Resolution
 We will do our best to resolve any problems or issues that you may have with 
  us or our services in a satisfactory manner.
If, however, we are unable to reach 
  a mutually satisfactory resolution, each of us agrees that any dispute or controversy 
  between us, or arising in any way out of the use or operation of our web site 
  or other services, or any information, services, products, and materials contained 
  in this site or available through our other services, shall be resolved by binding 
  arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association 
  (AAA) in Los Angeles, California, under the rules and procedures of the AAA.
The arbitrator shall have authority to resolve all matters in dispute between 
  us (subject to the legal disclaimer and liability limitations set forth above), 
  including the applicability, scope and binding effect of this arbitration agreement, 
  and to award arbitration costs and expenses to the prevailing party as determined 
  by the arbitrator.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may pursue preliminary 
  or injunctive remedies in an appropriate judicial forum pending the decision 
  of the arbitrator, without waiving the right or affecting the obligation to 
  arbitrate hereunder.
