Privacy policyTrade Me has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
In this policy we explain how we handle information about you that we gather, store and use.
For additional information about your relationship with Trade Me, please review our Terms and Conditions.
In this policy, “Personal Information” means the same as it does in the Privacy Act 1993 (which is: information about an identifiable individual).
Other terms that have capital letters in this Privacy Policy but aren't defined here carry the same meaning as in the Terms and Conditions.1.
Use of your information

Trade Me does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties.
Personal Information is information about an identifiable individual, as defined by the Privacy Act 1993.
==========
Trade Me collects information about you through your use of the Services and the Website, including your registration details and information relating to your use of the Website and the Services, such as the content you access (like listings you have viewed and the search queries you input).
Trade Me uses the information we collect to help us provide the Services to you, to verify your identity, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Trade Me Limited, our users, or others, for internal research purposes, for promoting and marketing other Trade Me products and Services to you, and for any other use that you authorise.
Your membership's trading history is published in your feedback if someone places feedback about you.
We release Personal Information only when we believe release is appropriate for legal compliance and law enforcement (including to government agencies with statutory law enforcement responsibilities); to facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Trade Me, our users, or others.
Government agencies with statutory roles enabling them to request data from us include but are not restricted to the Police, Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
==========
If you supply Trade Me with the name and number on your Firearms Licence when you bid on, list, confirm a purchase for, or ask a question on a firearms listing, you authorise Trade Me to provide this information to Police to verify that the Firearms Licence is current and valid.
If we have reason to believe that you have used another person’s payment card or payment details without their permission or knowledge, we may disclose your information relating to the transaction to that person or their bank.
You can contact Trade Me to ask whether your information has been provided, or with any other privacy-related question.
==========
Just email us.
Where Trade Me uses third parties to undertake services, we may provide those third parties with some of your information if it is required to fulfil those services.
For example, we use third parties to send you letters for address verification, to provide you with shipping services or to conduct research for us to ensure the Services we provide you are relevant and personalised to your interests.
We also use third party software (such as customer relationship management, marketing automation and accounting software) that holds your information, sometimes overseas.
We require any third party to undertake strict precautions to protect your information against unauthorised use or disclosure.
If you wish to take Disputes Tribunal (or other) proceedings against another member, you can contact Trade Me for a statutory declaration form which must be completed before we will consider releasing anyone else's information to you.
You may only request contact details for the sole purpose of making a claim.
==========
Despite clause 1(i), if you are involved in a dispute to which the Buyer Protection Policy applies, you authorise us to (at our discretion) provide the other party with any correspondence or evidence relevant to the dispute which you’ve provided to us.
In limited circumstances, we may also provide your contact details to the other party to help resolve the dispute (but will always seek your permission first).
If you use the Afterpay Service to conduct a transaction (either as a buyer or a seller), Trade Me may disclose your information to Afterpay NZ Limited (“Afterpay”) or a related company of Afterpay where necessary to: (i) facilitate payments under the Afterpay Service; (ii) help with resolution of a dispute (including where the Buyer Protection Policy applies); (iii) help process a refund, chargeback and/or reversal; (iv) report suspicious or potentially fraudulent activity on the Website in connection with the Afterpay Service; (v) allow suspension of the Afterpay Service where a seller’s sales through the Afterpay Service disproportionately lead to a buyer’s default on payment obligations to Afterpay; or (vi) ensure Afterpay can enforce any contractual rights given for Afterpay’s benefit under the Afterpay terms for Trade Me sellers.

==========
Listing content

When you create a listing, we make certain information publicly available (for example, the listing description, images, your user name and feedback score and in certain cases your contact details).
We refer to this broadly as listing content.
Listing content varies depending on the type of listing, and the category.
This section of the policy explains what we and others do with listing content.
==========
Listing content becomes public when you publish it using our Service.
Once you publish it, listing content becomes available via the internet, including to users of our API.
Listing content may appear in applications and on other websites.
Users of our API must agree to our API terms and conditions.
We retain all listing content after listings have expired.
Listing content may also persist elsewhere when third parties access and cache listings while they are live.
==========
For example, Google do this when they index the web for searching and so old listings may survive in Google searches for a period of time.
In certain cases we have commercial arrangements with third parties to display or use listing content.
We also use some listing content to enrich our other Services (for example, we use vehicle images to enhance our MotorWeb VIR).
We may use your listing content to promote your listings to other members on the Website, or more broadly, such as through display advertising, in electronic direct mail and on social media.
3.
==========
Email

It is the policy of Trade Me to send our members email throughout the auction process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc.).
Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request.
In addition, Trade Me will send newsletters and other communications to members.
Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list.
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.
4.
==========
Emailing tools

Trade Me provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to Trade Me or to send references to a specific listing to a friend.
You may not use the "Email this listing to a friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions.
We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses.
5.
==========
Membership registration

Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information and may also require demographic information.
We may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our affiliated partners.
Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary.
6.
==========
Managing your Personal Information

The Privacy Act gives you the right to access and correct your information.
Contact us if you wish to access or update your Personal Information, including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc.
When you update your details Trade Me will store your old details to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions - specifically the use of one account per member.
==========
If you wish to close your account and delete any Personal Information you have submitted to us, please contact us at privacy@trademe.co.nz to make that request.
We consider each request for deletion on a case by case basis taking into account our legal obligations to retain certain information.
7.
==========
Delivery address details

Trade Me enables you to save one or more of your delivery addresses which we will store against your profile.
When you buy an item you have the option of selecting a delivery address which we will then send to the seller.
We will never give the seller your address without your permission.
8.
==========
Payment instructions setup

Trade Me enables you to save and send a standard payment instructions email to the successful buyer when your auction ends.
When you set up each auction you can choose to have the saved message sent automatically or edit your message at that time.
9.
==========
Credit and debit card security

We work diligently to protect the security of your information, including credit and debit card information.
We protect your credit and debit card information during transmission by using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts your information when transmitted over the Internet.
Trade Me retains only partial card details.
However they may be held by either Direct Payment Solutions (DPS) - review their Privacy Policy - or Paystation - review their Privacy Policy - depending on which provider processes the transaction.
When topping up your Trade Me account by credit/debit card, you may have the option to "save this card for next time".
If you choose this option, your credit/debit card details are encrypted and securely stored by DPS or Paystation.
10.
==========
API

Trade Me provides an application programming interface (API) to enable software to interface with the Website.
The API enables developers to build new applications for our members to use.
We use it ourselves to power our mobile applications.
==========
As a result, information you publish on Trade Me may be accessed through the API and may appear in other places such as applications or websites.
We may charge third parties in various ways for access to our API.
Some applications enable you to interact with Trade Me through the API in a way that requires you to log in.
To do this, most of these applications will direct you through a secure process on Trade Me called 'OAuth', where you are able to let the application connect to your account.
A smaller set of applications will require you to enter your username and password directly into the application, and only applications specifically authorised by Trade Me are capable of doing this.
In no case will anyone be able to retrieve your password from the API.
If you allow an application to connect to your Trade Me account, that application will be able to access information that you can see when you are logged in to Trade Me.
==========
This includes the information found within My Trade Me, such as your watch list, sold items or personal contact information.
You should only allow applications you trust to access your Trade Me account.
If someone is using an application to access Trade Me and trades with you, that application may be able to access information that you provide to the other person during the trading process, such as your email and delivery address.
Anyone using our API must comply with Trade Me's API terms and conditions and this Privacy Policy.
11.
==========
Trade Me Jobs

Trade Me facilitates sending job applications to organisations advertising on Trade Me Jobs.
We forward applications, including disclosure of your Personal Information, on your behalf directly to the organisation whose job you apply for.
Applications you send are stored on our servers for a limited time.
==========
The CVs and documents section of My Trade Me allows you to store and re-use CVs, cover letters, or other documents.
We securely store documents that you save in your CVs and documents sections, and in your Trade Me Job Profile.
They are available to you, and organisations you send them to.
We may scan your CVs stored in My Trade Me for the purpose of personalising and improving the relevance of job advertisements presented to you.
We may use a third party to scan your CVs to automatically populate your Trade Me Job Profile with your CV information.
We require any third party to undertake strict precautions to protect your information against unauthorised use or disclosure.
Your information may be retained by the third party for a short time for caching purposes, before being permanently deleted.
==========
You can create your Trade Me Job Profile or we may use information you have submitted to us (including your CV information, Trade Me Job Profile information, contact details and your Trade Me search history) to create your Trade Me Job Profile.
If we create your Trade Me Job Profile, you will be advised before your Trade Me Job Profile is activated.
You can update or deactivate your Trade Me Job Profile or change your display settings at any time in your Trade Me Job Profile.
We may use your Trade Me Job Profile to better recommend jobs to you, and to allow advertisers and recruiters to contact you about jobs you may be interested in.
When your Trade Me Job Profile is active, your information may be displayed to selected recruiters and advertisers.
==========
You can delete your CVs and documents at any time through My Trade Me.
If you delete your CV, it will be immediately removed from your list of stored CVs, and from our system completely within 7 days.
Where your CV or documents have been provided to an advertiser or recruiter before deletion by Trade Me, the retention of any such documents by the advertiser or recruiter will be subject to their privacy policies.
Documents you upload to the CVs and documents section of My Trade Me will expire and be deleted after 5 years.
Documents that are deleted may persist for a limited time in our backup systems.
