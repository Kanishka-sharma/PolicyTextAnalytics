Cookies
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser.
This enables our system to recognize your browser and  remember your passenger names and billing information so that you won't have to retype it.
The address and passenger information is saved to your hard drive by the Southwest Airlines web server.
This information can only be accessed by the Southwest Airlines web server; Internet users and other companies cannot access this information.
Unless you have created a Traveler Account, your credit card number will not be saved, and you must type it in each time you purchase travel using Ticketless Travel Online (please see Traveler Accounts for details on saving credit card information on our web site).

We also utilize cookies to track the effectiveness of our online advertising.
The information contained in the cookies contains no individually identifiable data, will be treated as confidential information of Southwest Airlines, and will only be used to make informed decisions regarding the performance of our online advertising initiatives.
In short, these efforts help Southwest Airlines to maintain low costs and low fares for you, our Customers.

Security
We use Network Security Services (NSS) to protect your billing information.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts information and keeps the data private and confidential between your machine and Southwest Airlines.
This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet.
Look for two security icons, the "s" after "http" in the address line and the lock in the top menu bar and bottom status bar of your browser in Netscape (or in the bottom status bar only in Internet Explorer).
