Information We Collect
The information we collect allows us to see browsing habits at an individual level, but we do not attempt to identify the exact individual who is browsing.
Read more about the types of information used in Interest-Based Advertising, as well as what to expect when visiting our Site.
==========
Sovrn Services  and Site collects both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
Sovrn does not collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) about Readers such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or phone numbers, unless provided to us through the Site when requesting materials or information from us.
The following provides more detail into the types of Personal Information we collect (and in some instances purchase from partners) and use in conjunction with the Sovrn Services and Site:


Cookie ID
A randomly generated identifier (created by Sovrn) that is stored on a browser and allows us to understand Reader browsing behavior, without knowing the exact identity of the individual.
==========
Also known as a third-party cookie.
Universal ID
An identifier typically constructed of a Reader’s hashed and salted email address that will recognize user identity across different platforms.
The Universal ID is created by an identity provider, rather than each individual third party, as in the case of cookies, and is also known as first-party data.
==========
Device information
Device information can include your browser agent, browser type, operating system, device type, use of ad blocking tools, and information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices.
Hashed email
Hashing is a way of making a piece of data, like an email address, into a hexadecimal string so that it is no longer readable.
Each email address has its own unique hexadecimal string that remains consistent no matter where the email address is used.
IP address
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to each device connected to a computer network that allows the device to communicate on the Internet.
==========
Most IP addresses are dynamic, meaning they change every time the device is restarted.
General location information
Using your IP address and third-party services, we may collect general location information such as your country, city or state.
Collecting this information not only supports our services, but helps us to understand your data rights.
==========
Mobile advertising ID
In mobile apps, we use identifiers provided by the mobile device’s operating system that can be reset by users.
Typical advertising IDs are AdID (Android) and IDFA (Apple).
Mobile advertising IDs allow developers and marketers to track activity associated with a specific device for advertising purposes.
==========
They’re also used to enhance serving and targeting capabilities.
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)
PII such as first/last name and email address may be required for some inquiries through the Site.
Sovrn will only collect PII you voluntarily provide.
==========
Precise location information
Precise location information may include, for example, data obtained from cell tower or Wi-Fi triangulation techniques, or latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS technology, if such data is sufficiently precise to locate a specific device.
How We Collect Information
Sovrn uses various technologies to collect both Personal- and Non-Personal Information, such as cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, or scripts.
We also collect information voluntarily provided through our Site.
The term ‘cookies’ is used as an umbrella term for these technologies; for convenience, these technologies are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “cookies.”

How to Opt-Out
Sovrn supports various opt-out mechanisms, where each option provides different results related to cross-device tracking and targeted advertising.
While using these mechanisms may prevent Interest-based Advertising or the sale of your Personal Information, there are no mechanisms for preventing advertising altogether.
Opting Out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising
Readers can choose to opt out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising activities on their browser(s) or device(s).
==========
For more information on how to opt-out of the sale of personal information, please see the section, “Exercising California Consumer Rights” located under “Information for California Consumers” in the “Country and State Specific Disclosures” section, below or our Privacy Center.
Your opt-out choice will apply to the browser or device where you make the choice.
==========
This means that Sovrn will not deliver Interest-based Advertising to this browser or device and we will not otherwise use or transfer data collected on this browser or device for Interest-based Advertising.
To simplify the management of Interest-based Advertising preferences, Sovrn participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) AdChoices program that allows a user to manage their Interest-based Advertising preferences across all participating DAA members.
==========
The DAA provides two tools, WebChoices to manage preferences on web browsers, and AppChoices to manage preferences on mobile platforms like Android or Apple iOS devices.
Readers who wish to opt out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from a browser for Interest-based Advertising purposes can visit https://www.aboutads.info/ to learn more about Interest-based Advertising and to exercise opt-out choice with respect to Sovrn and other companies participating in the DAA’s self-regulatory program.
Readers who wish to opt-out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from apps on a mobile device for Interest-based Advertising purposes can download the DAA’s AppChoices app.
When using DAA’s opt-out tools, choice will be effective only on the browser or device where choice has been exercised.
If using a different device or browser, the opt-out choice(s) will need to be renewed for the new device or browser.
==========
Our opt-out tool for browsers is cookie-based, so that an opt-out choice can only be honored if a browser is set to accept third-party cookies.
If the opt-out cookie is deleted, then the opt-out choice(s) must be renewed.
==========
Opting out of Interest-based Advertising does not prevent data collection–we may continue to collect, use and transfer such data for other purposes such as contextual advertising based on a current visit to a website, fraud prevention, improving site performance and other purposes referred to in this Privacy Policy.
Opting out also will not stop advertising from appearing in a browser.
After opting-out, Readers may receive advertising from Sovrn Services when visiting websites of a Publisher who uses our Services, but that advertising will not be interest-based.
After opting out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising, Readers may also continue to receive Interest-based Advertising through other companies.

Readers who wish to opt-out of Sovrn //Commerce collection, use, or transfer of Personal Information from the websites you visit, the links you click, or the merchants you make purchases from, visit our Privacy Center or the //Commerce opt-out page.
Opting out of Sovrn //Commerce cookies means that Sovrn //Commerce will stop placing cookies on your device when you browse Sovrn //Commerce enabled websites and/or links.
==========
To honor your opt-out choice, we need to place a cookie on your device so that we know not to track your activity.
Clearing your browser’s cache or cookies will remove this cookie, and you will be required to opt-out of tracking again.
Similarly, if you access sites that use Sovrn //Commerce from a different browser or device than the browser or device on which you opted-out of tracking, you will be required to opt-out again.

Verification Process and Required Information
We may require additional information to verify a consumer’s identity or understand the scope of the request, depending on how we are contacted.
We will only ask for information needed to verify a consumer’s identity, such as a different email address, mobile identifier, or cookie ID.
When submitting our online form, consumers have the opportunity to include multiple email addresses–each email address will require a separate response from the requestor in order to be included in the requested action.
Authorized Agent
Consumers may designate an authorized agent to exercise California data rights under the CCPA on your behalf by (i) verifying the consumer’s identity and (ii) providing evidence of the consumer’s written permission authorizing an agent to make a request on their behalf.
