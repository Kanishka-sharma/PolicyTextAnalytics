What personal information does Metroflog collect?
During registration, the only personal information that Metroflog currently requests is your email address and your location.
==========
You may volunteer additional personal information at other times including, but not limited to, creating a Public Profile or updating your Personal Account Information.
Any additional personal information that you submit to Metroflog will be protected under the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

Browser Information
Every time you visit a page on the Internet, your web browser sends specific information to the web site you are visiting.
Metroflog's server logs automatically collect and store this information from your web browser, including your IP address, specific type of browser software, Metroflog-related cookies (see below), and the pages you visit at Metroflog.
We use this information primarily to help diagnose and fix any technical problems that you may encounter.
==========
But we also use IP information to help us limit access to Metroflog by users who have violated our Terms of Use (or to help users block access to their Metroflog sites by other users).
Cookies
Like most sites that have features requiring registration and sign-in, Metroflog uses cookies to recognize you when you return to Metroflog and to keep track of your username and password when you are signed in (so you don't have to re-sign in every time you visit a new page at Metroflog).
==========
Some third-party advertisers may also set cookies when their ads are viewed on Metroflog.
These cookies help us provide you with customized content (including information about your Metroflog site and promotions that you may find interesting - or, at least, not terribly annoying), based on your interests and activities at Metroflog.
Who else collects personal information from me?
Any personal information that you volunteer on Metroflog.com (any URL that starts with http://www.metroflog.com) is collected by Metroflog alone, unless specifically noted otherwise.
How does Metroflog use my personal information?
Metroflog uses your email address only to confirm your account and contact you in case of any problems with your account.
==========
Upon your request, Metroflog may forward additional information to your email address including, but not limited to, weekly stats, messages from visitors to your Metroflog Site or additional information about the Company.
To continue to provide Metroflog's products and services free-of-charge, Metroflog may display advertisements or other promotional information.
Any additional personal information that you volunteer will help Metroflog customize the advertisements it displays to match your interests.
Metroflog does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers.
Metroflog may share general demographic information with advertisers and business partners (such as aggregated statistics about member's interests and occupations).
==========
But Metroflog never gives advertisers access to your individual personal account information.
Links
Metroflog contains links to sites.
Metroflog is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.
When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site.
Our privacy policy only governs information collected on Metroflog.com.
==========
Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members
Metroflog members can invite friends to join the service and visit their sites by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system.
Metroflog stores the requested email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations.
==========
Metroflog.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations or invitation reminders.
Recipients of invitations from Metroflog.com may contact Metroflog.com to request the removal of their information from our database.

==========
To minimize the risk of other people accessing your private Metroflog account, we suggest you log out of Metroflog before you leave any computer that you use, even a personal one.
