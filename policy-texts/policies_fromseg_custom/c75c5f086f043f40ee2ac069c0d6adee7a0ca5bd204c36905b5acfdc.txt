Cookie Policy
Like most websites, this one uses cookies.
Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by your browser.
They're used for many things, such as remembering whether you've visited the site before, so that you remain logged in - or to help us work out how many new website visitors we get each month.
They contain information about the use of your computer but don't include personal information about you (they don't store your name, for instance).

Our own ad serving and management cookies
We sell space on some of our websites to advertisers - they pay for the content you enjoy for free.
As part of this, we use several services to help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be interested in.
These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
But they might hold a record of what other websites you've looked at - so we could show you a car advert if you've previously visited a motoring website.
These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies.
Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.

Other ad management cookies
Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations.
==========
Our advertising partners will serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to the Website and other websites.
In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer.
These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising, about cookies, and about how to turn this feature off, please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
==========
Site management cookies
These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website.
For instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly).
We may use similar cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for instance, or don't vote comments up/down more than once).
These cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change your browser setting to refuse all cookies (see above) if you do not wish to accept them.
