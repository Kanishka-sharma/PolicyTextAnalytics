Privacy Policy
AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “AppLovin”) is a mobile content company that provides application developers with an innovative platform to deliver more social content to their consumers.
Our unique technology enables our partners to show mobile application users more personalized content, including greetings that display user names (e.g., “Hey Adam” rather than just “Hey”), push notifications that send alerts to users’ friends about what the user is doing in an application (e.g., “Adam has just signed up for App X, come and welcome him), and personalized advertisements that are based on a users’ interests and behaviors.
In order to provide these services, we collect and use certain information about user activity and preferences.

==========
Information We Collect From Consumers
If you are a Consumer that downloads and uses an AppLovin App or otherwise interacts with the Services, our Software Development Kit (“SDK”) automatically collects the device information identified below and transmits it to AppLovin so that we can provide social features on behalf of the developer who owns that specific AppLovin App.
We may collect and transmit such device information as either raw or hashed data, depending on the sensitivity of the information in question.
Raw Data.
The SDK collects and transfers non-sensitive device information as raw data, such as:

First name;
First name of contacts saved on device;
Geographic location;
Carrier;
Device make and manufacturer;
Operating System version installed on device;
Name of mobile application through which a Consumer interacts with the Services;
Language settings;
Birth year;
Whether WiFi has been enabled (y/n);
Whether unknown sources download permission has been enabled (y/n);

8.
==========
Children’s Privacy
We do not use the Services to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of thirteen (13).
We request that such individuals do not provide personal information through the Services.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should promptly contact us and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.
9.
==========
Data Security, Integrity and Retention
Your privacy is very important to AppLovin and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards.
For example, we use firewalls, encryption technology and other automated software designed to protect against fraud and identity theft.
==========
In addition, we take steps to ensure that sensitive information is stored in an anonymous format through a technique known as “hashing”.
When a Consumer downloads and uses an AppLovin App, our SDK helps to collect and process information locally on the Consumer’s mobile device.
This allows us to identify the sensitivity level of certain device information prior to transferring it to our servers for storage.
Rather than sending sensitive device information as raw data that can be easily associated with the relevant Consumer, the SDK only transfers anonymous hashed representations of certain types of information back to AppLovin.
Our servers then associate the hashed representations with a unique anonymous identifier assigned to each Consumer by AppLovin.
When a Consumer subsequently interacts with the Services, this process allows us to identify that Consumer and provide social content and personalized advertising without storing his or her sensitive information in a form that would be easily readable to unauthorized third parties.
AppLovin also protects Consumer privacy by seeking to minimizing the amount of sensitive data that we store on our servers in the first place.
To this end, our SDK allows us to deliver social content through the Services by combining information stored on our servers with information stored locally on a Consumer’s mobile device.
For example, although you may receive a push notification containing a picture of your friend telling you that your friend signed up for an app you also have, AppLovin never actually transmits these photographs and they are not stored on an AppLovin server.
==========
Instead, when you interact with the Services our SDK associates your device information with a unique identifier that AppLovin has assigned to you.
Once your device has been “identified” in this manner, the SDK can use locally stored information (e.g., your photograph or your friends’ photographs) to deliver the content through the Services.
For additional information regarding how we store data, please refer to the Consumer Privacy portion of the Site.
You may also contact us anytime with your questions or concerns.
10.
==========
Changes to the Policy
We may, in our sole discretion, make changes to the Policy from time to time in order to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes.
The most recent version of the Policy will always be posted on the Site.
==========
If we do make any changes, we will also update the “Effective Date” posted at the top of the Policy and we may provide you with other forms of notice, such as email.
We encourage you to review the Policy periodically to ensure that you understand how we collect, use and share information through the Services.
==========
Any changes to the Policy will become effective when the revised Policy is posted on the Site.
By continuing to use the Services following such changes, you are agreeing to accept the terms of the revised Policy.

Definitions
Aggregate Information.
Aggregate information refers to de-identified information about groups or particular types of individuals that use the Services.
Such information does not identify you as a particular individual.
==========
An example of aggregate information would include the total number people that accessed an AppLovin App from a particular region or while using a specific type of mobile device.
Anonymous Information.
Anonymous information refers to information that does not (and cannot reasonably be used to) directly or indirectly identify you as an individual, such as the UDID and/or IP Address of the device that you use to access the Services.
If anonymous information is ever directly or indirectly associated with personal information, AppLovin will also treat the anonymous information as personal information.
==========
AppLovin Apps.
AppLovin Apps means the mobile applications within our network of application publishers and developers.
Business Partners.
Business Partners are the mobile application advertisers, publishers and developers in the AppLovin network that have registered for the Services.
==========
Consumers.
Consumers are those individuals who download, use or otherwise interact with an AppLovin App.
A Contact Score is a numerical representation of the frequency with which a Consumer uses his or her mobile device to interact with saved contacts (e.g., the number of text messages or phone calls the Consumer sends and/or receives to or from a particular individual on the device).
The AppLovin SDK locally analyzes the frequency of these interactions and assigns a Contact Score for each of the Consumer’s saved contacts.
Only the Contact Score itself - rather than specific details regarding interactions with such saved contacts - is transferred to AppLovin and stored on our servers.
This provides AppLovin with an anonymous indication of a Consumer’s favorite contacts, thus allowing us to deliver more effective and relevant content while simultaneously protecting the privacy of the Consumer’s interactions on his or her mobile device.
==========
Cookies.
Cookies are small pieces of information that your internet browser places on the hard drive of your device when you visit a website.
We use cookies to identify your device when you return to the Site.
.
==========
Cookies allow AppLovin to associate your device with other information that resides in our database, which helps us to remember your preferences and personalize your experience with the Services.
You can configure the settings of most internet browsers to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or to reject cookies entirely.
If you disable cookies, however, you will not have access to many features that make your interaction with the Services more efficient and some of the Services may not function properly.
==========
You can find additional information about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com.
Device Information.
Device information refers to the information automatically collected from a Consumer’s device by our SDK.
==========
Such information may be processed locally, or transferred to AppLovin for processing and/or storage.
AppLovin may collect and/or store device information as raw or hashed data.
For a complete list of the device information we collect from Consumers, please refer to the Information We Collect From Consumers section of the Policy.
==========
Hashed Data.
Hashing is a technique that anonymizes data.
Storing information as hashed data allows AppLovin to associate certain information with a Consumer without directly affiliating him or her with personal information.
AppLovin stores sensitive information in hashed form to help protect the privacy of such Consumers while providing the Services.
Please refer to the Data Security, Integrity and Retention of the Policy or the Consumer Privacy portion of the Site for additional information about how we use “hashing” to safeguard Consumer information.
Personal Information.
Personal information means information that can be used, either directly or indirectly, to contact you or identify you as a particular individual.
This would include, among other things, your full name, email address, and mobile telephone number.
==========
Raw Data.
Raw data refers to data that has not been processed for a particular use or otherwise transferred from its original format.
AppLovin only stores non-sensitive device information as raw data.
==========
Software Development Kit (SDK).
AppLovin’s SDK, which is integrated into each AppLovin App, is software that allows our Business Partners to provide you with social and personalized content.
By downloading and using an AppLovin App, Consumers grant the application developer with permission to collect such device information and share it with AppLovin.
AppLovin may track this information over time and across multiple AppLovin Apps (and may also combine the device information with anonymous information from other sources) in order to, among other things, provide better social content and deliver personalized advertisements through the Services.
==========
Web Beacons.
A web beacon (sometimes referred to as a “pixel tag” or a “clear GIFs”) is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a website, email or other communication.
Web beacons are typically one-pixel, transparent images and are used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database in order to associate that individual with previously acquired information about him or her in a database.
AppLovin uses web beacons keep track of certain online behavior (e.g., the websites you visit, the mobile applications you use, your interaction with AppLovin emails etc.) in order to help us to determine the types of things that you find the most interesting.
