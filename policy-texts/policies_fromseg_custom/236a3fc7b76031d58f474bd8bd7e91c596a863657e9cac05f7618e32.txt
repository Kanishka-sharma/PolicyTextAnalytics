Why and how we collect information
We need particular information to perform audio advertising targeting.
We believe that listening to relevant advertising extends the experience.
We mostly use cookies for targeting however we also consider any efficient technology like tags, scripts, pixels, beacons, mobile applets, or mobile device IDs to collect more information.
==========
We also exchange data with our reliable partners by a server to server communication or by SFTP connection.
An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user’s computer by the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.
Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user’s browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past).
They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers (Source: Wikipedia).
All other used technologies allow us to communicate with your web browser or, in case of mobile applets between application and our server.
Please be advised that term “cookie” refers to cookie and other identifiers.

How we process information
We are an ad-tech company that focuses on providing unparallel Service and experience to end users.
We process information to perform advertising activities.
For example, to play audio ads that are relevant to end user’s interests or location.
We also may use the information to count the number of playouts (ads played to one end user) or to identify if the end user is unique in terms of ad campaign definition.
That data is also processed to merge and relate to publishers, campaigns or other relevant targeting information.
Cookies are also used to perform end user opt-out.
==========
Each user may have a unique ID assigned for further processing, as for example, to match users’ browser activity with the mobile device based on the probabilistic analysis.
It may also be used to match our Service with our partners’ advertising services.
Our unique user ID might be matched with data that are processed by our partners to deliver the most relevant advertising.
We also may use data and information to detect unusual behaviour that might come from fraudulent bot activities.
The user ID is also used during the process of advertising campaign set up by our partners, including price calculation, potential advertising reach or a number of playouts.
To help us to continuously offer the best service for our partners we may conduct internal data mining for research purposes and new features development.
