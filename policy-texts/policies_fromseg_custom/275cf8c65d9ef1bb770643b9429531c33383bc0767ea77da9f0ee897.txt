Our Policy:
Welcome to the web site: https://slack.com (the “Site”) of Slack Technologies, Inc. (“Slack Technologies”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”).
This Site is operated by Slack Technologies and has been created to provide information about our company and our service, Slack, which includes real-time communication, messaging, archiving and search services and related systems, technologies, and mobile applications (together with the Site, the “Service(s)”) to our Service users and visitors (“you”, “your”).
This Privacy Policy sets forth Slack Technologies’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and users of the Services.
At the outset, we want to be clear that Slack Technologies is not in the business of selling your information.

We consider our custodianship of your information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.
There are, however, certain ways in which we will use your Personal Data, as set forth in more detail in this policy.
Slack Technologies has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.
The TRUSTe certification covers only our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our website: https://slack.com and our service, Slack.
The TRUSTe program also covers information that may be collected through our mobile application.
The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Slack Technologies.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe here.
==========

Information We Collect:
When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
Personal Data That You Provide:
We collect Personal Data from you, such as your name, email address and company name, when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, register for access to our Service, or use certain Services.
We may also collect your credit card information if you decide to upgrade your plan with us.
By providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be stored on the servers of Slack Technologies and other authorized parties located in the United States and other countries.
==========
When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier.
We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or services.
Other Information:
Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Slack Technologies through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information.
Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, will not be used to specifically identify you.
Slack Technologies may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Slack Technologies affiliates, agents or service providers.
==========
The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of users of our Services, the aspects of the Services being used, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers and the like.
In operating the Services, we or our vendors may also use a technology called "cookies."
A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services.
Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services, help us analyze Services usage more accurately and may be used in marketing the Service.
For instance, we may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit.
We will not collect Personal Data through such cookies except with your permission.
On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section that provides information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
==========
We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because you may not be able to use the Service without them.
The use of cookies by our service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Our service providers use persistent cookies to gather statistics that improve quality of service.
==========
Our third party partners also employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site.
We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal data.
Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Slack Technologies often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us.
This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Slack Technologies may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners.
This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
Slack Technologies may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, customers and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Mobile Analytics: We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
==========
Use of Personal Data and Other Information:
Slack Technologies uses the Personal Data and other information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided.
For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.
Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
Slack Technologies and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services, and to send you tips about using Slack or inform you of new features and other news about Slack.
Any email we send to you, other than those necessary to operate the service, will include the means for you to "opt-out" of receiving similar email in the future.

Please consider carefully what information you disclose in connection with the Services, how you select your preferences, and your desired level of privacy.

Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your files or information available to third parties or the public.
Always remember that when you share any type of information with others, such information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.
==========
Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.
In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data.

Examples of such functions include mailing information, hosting servers, providing data center services, maintaining databases and processing payments.
