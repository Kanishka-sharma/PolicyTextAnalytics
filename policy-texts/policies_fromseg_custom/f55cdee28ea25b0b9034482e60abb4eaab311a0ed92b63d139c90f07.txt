jasinski hasn't been here for the longest time, but he has made the best of it so far.
His love for the community blossomed and eventually became a huge poster of over 500 deviants.
But this is not all he has done for us.
==========
His cooperation made DA Prints a huge success on opening day and his prints continue to sell daily.
He has also contributed a featured wallpaper for subscribers, which he didn't have to do.
He is a very giving person and is always looking for a way to help out.
His talent is only matched by his heart and we truly appreciate all he has done.
