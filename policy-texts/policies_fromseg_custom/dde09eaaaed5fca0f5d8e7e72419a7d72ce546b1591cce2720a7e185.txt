Vendor Briefings
Briefings provide a forum for IT vendors to present their products, services and business strategies with analysts who cover the vendor specifically or a related technology or market.

Gartner's industry analysts use briefings as a key input and research tool.
They schedule briefings at their discretion based purely on an interest in the vendor, its technologies and its marketplace, not because of any fee or contractual relationship.
