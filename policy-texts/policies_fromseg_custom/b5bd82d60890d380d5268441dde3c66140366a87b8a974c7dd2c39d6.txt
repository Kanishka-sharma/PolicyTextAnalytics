==========
VA's outreach mission is defined in 38 USC, Chapter 63, which specifically charges VA "with the affirmative duty of seeking out eligible Veterans and eligible dependents and providing them with such services."
The information gathered at www.VA.gov and www.VA.gov/explore will be used to conduct this outreach.

Email Subscriptions and Updates
VA maintains several lists of subscribers who have asked to receive periodic email updates.
Any recipient of a VA email may unsubscribe from future messages via a link at the bottom of each email message.
We do not sell, rent, exchange, or otherwise disclose our list subscribers to persons or organizations outside VA.
Messages sent from VA to email subscribers may include a tracking pixel to provide basic aggregate analytics, such as the percentage of recipients who opened an email or clicked on a link in an email, the percentage of subscribers using various email clients, and the number of times an email was forwarded or printed.
==========
Our email analytics providers, GovDelivery and Litmus, also offer the capability to view some data at an individual level, such as whether a mass email was opened within 30 days of being sent.
VA only views this data on an aggregate basis.
