The Information JSTOR Collects


To facilitate your access to the JSTOR archive, we may collect 
    personally identifiable information, including your name, address (including 
    your Internet Protocol address and email address), and, where applicable,

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable

    Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 
    or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
We also 
    require users to agree to our Terms and Conditions of 
    Use.
We use the information you provide to facilitate your use 
    of the JSTOR archive, to respond to your inquiries about JSTOR, to improve 
    the design of our site, for system administration and troubleshooting purposes, 
    to enable us to respond to uses of the JSTOR archive in violation of the JSTOR 
    Terms and Conditions of Use, and to, in aggregated form, track and analyze 
    site usage.

JSTOR employs "cookie" technology.
Cookies are 
    small pieces of text that are stored on your computer and act as a tool for 
    controlling certain system variables and storing system configuration information 
    in the WWW environment.
JSTOR uses cookies to store user preferences for viewing 
    and printing and to store authentication information.
No personal information 
    is extracted in the cookie setting process, and we do not use cookies to identify 
    what other sites or pages you have visited.
We do not involve advertisers, 
    who may place a cookie on your browser, in the operation of our site.

==========
We have appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial 
    measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to the information we collect 
    online.
We do not, however, claim any responsibility for information collected 
    by or from websites linking to or from JSTOR.
Except in special circumstances, outlined below in Compliance 
    With Legal Proceedings, JSTOR does not share personal information about individual 
    users.
JSTOR does share general usage data in aggregated form so that no personal 
    information is identifiable to participating libraries, publishers, and the 
    general public.
JSTOR will provide you all of your personal information provided 
    at registration (where applicable) on request.
Compliance With Legal Proceedings


JSTOR may disclose personal information if required to do 
    so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to 
    comply with the law or a legal proceeding, to protect against violations of 
    our Terms and Conditions of Use, or to protect and 
    defend our rights and property or the rights and property of contributors 
    to the JSTOR archive.
==========
JSTOR will remove you and your personal information from 
    our database on request.
Please note that this may cancel your access to the 
    JSTOR archive.
