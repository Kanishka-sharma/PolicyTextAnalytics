Non-Personally Identifiable Information
RWM also collects certain non-personally identifiable information, including the non-personally identifiable information more fully described below.
Cookies.
RWM may use “cookies” on the Site.
Cookies are small pieces of information that RWM’s server places on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site.
==========
For example, RWM may place a cookie on a User’s computer when he/she initially registers at the Site.
The next time that User visits the Site, RWM’s server will recognize the cookie (and the User) and allow the User to perform certain actions immediately without signing in.
While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the User’s computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that cookies provide.
==========
IP Address.
RWM collects your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer the Site and RWM’s email messages to Site Users.
An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.
==========
Although the information collected through the foregoing methods does not itself contain any PII, RWM may analyze and match such information with other information that you provide (including PII) as well as information that RWM may obtain elsewhere, and RWM may share all or some of such information with actual or prospective distributors, dealers, or other third parties.
RWM may also disclose non-PII in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, or (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect the rights or property of RWM or Users of the Site.
