A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.

When Scribd Discloses Information:
·      Scribd does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.
Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Scribd Platform – such as when you publish attribution credits for documents or profile information – becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.

Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:
If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access THE SCRIBD PLATFORM at any time or in any manner.
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

If Scribd learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Scribd Platform, then Scribd will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become Scribd Platform member, then please contact Scribd at to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.
The following are some resources that may help parents and legal guardians in monitoring and limiting your childrens' access to certain types of material on the Internet.
While Scribd does not endorse these products, we provide information about them as a public service to our community.
