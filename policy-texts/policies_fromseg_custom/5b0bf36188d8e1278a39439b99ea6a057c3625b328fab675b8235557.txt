Beeswax is an advertising technology platform headquartered in New York City.
We are providing this services privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform and related services (collectively, “Services”) process information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our Services.
Beeswax runs a technology buying platform for digital media.
The Beeswax technology allows our customers to buy ad space on websites, mobile apps, video players, and other devices.
When ad space is bought or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet users who visit that site, apps, or device.
Generally, an Internet user's computer or mobile device comes into contact with Beeswax technology when a user views an ad delivered by our technology or clicks or taps on the ad to visit the advertiser's website or app.
==========
The Beeswax Services are intended primarily for use by businesses.
We may also collect personal information from individuals who visit our websites, interact with our marketing messages and emails, or engage with us about career opportunities with Beeswax.
For information about the privacy practices that apply to these interactions, please visit our Website Privacy Policy.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@beeswax.com.
Privacy Practices for Our Technology
Advertising supports the free content and digital user experiences that we all love.
==========
Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping our customers to display ads that may be of interest to you.
We believe that relevant ads are more valuable to users than less relevant ads.
More relevance also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads, which in turn leads to higher quality and richer consumer experiences.
==========
Beeswax is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and we adhere to the NAI Codes of Conduct.
To learn more about the NAI and the Code of Conduct please visit: http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code.
Beeswax adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the European Principles published by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), and the Self-Regulatory Principles published by the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC).
We honor the DAA’s, CDAA’s, and EDAA’s opt-out mechanisms for data collection and use in connection with mobile applications.

What Information We Collect, The Purpose of Collection and Use
The Beeswax technology collects information on behalf of its customers to help target online advertising to you based on your interests.
This information may include cookie and mobile advertising identifiers, your IP host address (which we truncate when we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR), your browser type (e.g. Chrome or Firefox), the date and time of the ad request, advertiser pages viewed, your operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows, Android, OSX), the URL or App you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (e.g. Verizon or Comcast).
==========
Contact Information
We collect contact information through our technology from customers, vendors and distributors who wish to obtain information or support, or to obtain access to our platform.
Contact information includes: first name, last name, email address, job title, name of the organization, country, state/region and phone numbers (cell and/or landline).
This contact information is used by our sales, support and operations teams to contact our customers, vendors and distributors for the purpose of providing the requested information or support, communicate via email regarding our current and future offerings, and/or provide and receive feedback on our Services.
==========
Analytics
Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection technology to collect information such as your IP host address, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, number of links you click, search terms, and other data.
We use this data to analyze the use of and improve our Services.
Mobile Tracking
To provide relevant ads to users on mobile devices we may also collect the following mobile specific information: device type, make and model, operating system, mobile advertising identifiers, operating system device identifier (For example, IDFA for iOS and Android ID for Android) and information about the apps you use.
We may also use the GPS location of your device if you have opted-in to provide it to one of the publishers or ad exchanges who make digital advertising inventory available through the Services as further described below under "Location Tracking."
Your iOS mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting and other settings that allow you to control the data that applications may use for location and interest-based advertising.
On Android devices, your settings may allow you to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads.”
When you have opted out using this setting on a device and that information is passed to Beeswax, Beeswax will not use your unique device identifier to target ads to you or place you in segments for future marketing.
Learn more about setting your privacy preferences on mobile devices at the NAI’s Your Options page.
==========
Cookies
Cookies are small packets of data that are stored on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visits to websites or your viewing of ads.
If you do not want us or our service providers to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off in your browser or device settings, and you may opt out here from our use of Beeswax cookies on your device.
Detailed information about managing cookies on your devices is provided in our Cookie Policy.
Pixel Tags
We also use pixel tags, which are small, invisible 1x1 images on a web page.
Pixel tags allow us to set, read and modify cookies when you visit the websites or apps of our partners.
==========
Please click our opt out here if you'd like to opt-out from having Beeswax collect your information in connection with our technology.
When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.
This cookie tells us not to collect your information to tailor our online advertising campaigns.
Please note that opt-out cookies are necessary to fulfill your opt-out requests.
If you block, delete or restrict cookies in any way, your opt-out request will not work.
Also, opt-out settings are specific to each browser or device, so you will need to set your opt-out preference for each one, and if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
If you opt-out through this method, we will not use your personal information in our Services; however, we may continue to use your information collected for other purposes, such as our own marketing.
If you wish to opt-out of such other uses of your information, see our Website Privacy Policy.
==========
Location Tracking
Beeswax may receive latitude and longitude of mobile users from publishers or ad exchanges.
We use such data for targeting ads and evaluating their success, and we may share it with third party companies acting as controllers (See, Onward Transfers to Third Parties).
This information is also maintained in our logs in accordance with our data retention policy (below).
In the European Union, when we receive precise location information and we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR, we truncate the location data to three decimal places to be less precise before storing such data.
Information We Receive from Third Parties
We may also receive information about you from third parties when you interact with third party sites or apps.
We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with the information we directly collect from you and use such information in accordance with this services privacy policy and requirements under applicable data protection and privacy laws.
==========
Use of Cross-Device Linking
Beeswax may offer cross-device linking services to our customers.
These services attempt to identify which identifiers are associated with the same user across multiple devices, such as between a desktop computer and a mobile device.
To enable these services, we may, subject to the section on Onward Transfer to Third Parties, share your pseudonymised information with contracted third parties that provide cross-device linking services.
For consumers who have opted-out from the use of your personal information by Beeswax, we do not share any of your information with these third parties and do not attempt to re-identify the user in any way.
==========
We do not utilize cross-device linking services when we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR or otherwise not permitted.
To effectively opt-out of our cross-device linking services, users must opt-out on every device and browser using our opt-out methods described in the Cookies section of this policy, including in the section on Mobile Tracking.
Detailed information about managing cookies and mobile tracking on your devices is provided in our Cookie Policy.
==========
Onward Transfer to Third Parties
Beeswax may share your information with its customers in connection with the offering of its Services.
For example, a Beeswax customer may receive a log of all ads they served through our platform with data about your cookie and mobile advertising identifiers that interacted with the ads, including IP host addresses and other pseudonymous information in non-aggregated form.
When we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR, any personal data for which a separate consent has not been received are pseudonymized (one-way hashed) before being shared with customers and are sufficiently protected as required by GDPR (see below for more information about how we handle the transfer of data outside the EEA).
==========
Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services.
We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services.
The types of companies that may receive personal information in support of our Services and their functions are: data analytics vendors, data hosting providers, optimization vendors, and document hosting and support services providers.
All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by Beeswax.
You may have the right to opt out of having your personal information transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by contacting us at privacy@beeswax.com.
Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request.
==========
Business Transfers.
In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity.
All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such information as set forth in this services privacy policy.
==========
Disclosure to Public Authorities.
We are required to disclose the information that we have collected in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.
We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.
==========
Access to Personal Information
Upon receipt of a verifiable request to privacy@beeswax.com, we will provide you with confirmation as to whether we are processing your personal information, and where we are the controller of such data, we will have it communicated to you within a reasonable time.
In cases where we are acting as a service provider to our customers, we are a data processor, and we do not directly control any personal data, so any changes or inaccuracies in the data we collect should be addressed to the businesses that are the controllers of such data.
Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.
==========

==========
Links to External Websites
The Beeswax technology may contain links to third party websites, content and services (“External Sites”).
Where Beeswax has relationships with such third parties, we use reasonable efforts to require our customers and partners to treat the personal information we share with them in accordance with applicable laws, the terms of any contracts we may have with them, and their own privacy policies, but otherwise we cannot control their use of this information.
Where we have no such relationship, we are not responsible for the privacy policies of those External Sites or their use of personal information.
You should check the applicable third party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any External Sites, and before providing any personal information to such External Sites.
Important Notice to All Non-US Residents

Important Notice for Residents of the European Economic Area, UK and Switzerland
With regard to the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), Beeswax’s role depends upon the personal data we collect and the circumstances under which we process it.
Where Beeswax acts as a data processor, we do so for our customers and other companies that interact with our Services for our customers, all of whom are obligated to have a lawful basis for processing personal data, such as the consumer’s consent, in order to use any personal data within our system.
For example, if a Beeswax customer is using cookies collected on the customer's website to retarget users with ads, the customer is obligated to have the proper consent for the use of cookies on the consumer’s devices and either consent or another lawful basis for the use of related data within Beeswax's system, and to respect opt-outs and the other obligations under the GDPR.
Where Beeswax acts as a data controller, we collect and process personal data to provide and enhance our Services for our customers.
For example, we use cookies to assist our customers personalize the advertisements you are served and to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how people use the websites where our customers’ advertisements are served and react to these advertisements.
Lawful Basis for EU Data Processing
We process personal data in several ways, each with respect for the privacy rights of individuals.
When we are acting either as the data controller or data processor for our customers, we rely on the following lawful bases for our processing:

Performance of contract.
We need to collect and process personal data in order to deliver our Services as required by our contracts with our customers.
Legitimate business interests.
We may use personal data for our legitimate business interests to administer our platforms, ensure the integrity of our transmission network, and to enforce our legal and contractual rights and obligations, for example, by analyzing data for signs of fraud.
Data Subject Consent.
To the extent our we or our customers need to collect and share, or to allow us to facilitate the collection and sharing of personal data to enable our Services, we or our customers may do so after providing necessary privacy notices and obtaining required consents.
==========
Privacy Shield
The EU-US Privacy Shield Framework was invalidated by the European Court of Justice in July 2020; nevertheless, Beeswax will continue to comply with it and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, in each case as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union member countries (including Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
Beeswax has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (the “Privacy Shield Principles”).
With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, for example, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
If there is a conflict between this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
