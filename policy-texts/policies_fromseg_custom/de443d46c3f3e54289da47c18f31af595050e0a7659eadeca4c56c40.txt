Ning, Inc.
Privacy Policy
Effective: July 20, 2010
Ning, Inc. ("Ning", "we" or "us") is an online service provider that provides a set of services and technology applications that enable users to create their own Networks utilizing our technology platform (the "Ning Platform").
Ning is not involved in the management of Networks on the Ning Platform and is not involved in the decisions relating to the focus of Networks or the Content uploaded or published to Networks using the Ning Platform.
These are your Networks and, as a Network Creator, you are responsible for managing them in all respects (including the actions, conduct, and Content of Your Members) in compliance with the Ning Terms of Service.
==========
We value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience on the Ning Platform as satisfying and safe as possible.
We have established this Privacy Policy to explain how Personal Information (as defined below) is collected on the Ning Platform, and how that Personal Information is used and disclosed.
"Personal Information" is information that allows a person to directly identify an individual, such as name or email address, and information that we combine directly with such identifying information.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Ning Terms of Service.
Any capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning set forth in the Ning Terms of Service.
By using the Ning Platform, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy.
1.
==========
How the Ning Platform Operates
The Ning Platform enables Users to create, join or browse social networks.
The Ning Platform also allows Third Party Application Developers to develop Third Party Applications for use on the Ning Platform.
This Privacy Policy refers to social networks created on the Ning Platform as "Networks" and refers to Users who create Networks as "Network Creators".
Users who join a Network are "Members" of that Network.
Network Creators are also considered Members of the Networks they create.
2.
==========
Collection of Personal Information
In order to create a Network using the Ning Platform, Network Creators must register for account credentials.
When you register for account credentials, Ning collects certain Personal Information, including your name, email address, and a password that you select.
In addition, Network Creators must provide their credit card or other payment information and telephone number (for customer support purposes).
==========
Ning or its third party payment providers use this Personal Information billing information solely to administer your services on the Ning Platform and to process your transactions including your purchase of Ning Product Plans, Support Services, and upgrades.
Network Creators and Third Party Application Developers might use the Ning Platform to collect, use, and retain all information, including Personal Information and Network Data, that is disclosed and uploaded by Members in connection with their use of Networks.
“Network Data” means as all data collected from a Network or Member and includes registration information, profile data, answers to Network profile questions, all Content and other information contributed by Members, and statistical information and analytics relating to usage and interactions within the Network.
When a User signs up to become a member of a Network, he or she is providing Personal Information to that Network's Network Creator and such Network Creator and its designated administrators will have access to all Personal Information and Network Data associated with any such Network.
==========
In addition, Network Creators will have the ability to reset Member passwords in the event that a Member loses or can’t remember it.
Network Creators and Third Party Application Developers might also collect additional types of Personal Information.
For each Network you use, you should check with the Network Creator regarding its policies governing its collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.
Additionally, for each Third Party Application that you add to your Network or your profile, you should check with the Third Party Application Developer regarding its policies governing its collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information.

==========
Passive Data Collection
Like most web-based services, Ning automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser when you use the Ning Platform.
We may use a variety of methods, including clear GIFs (also known as "web beacons"), and "cookies" to collect this information.
The information that we collect with these automated methods may include, for example, your IP address, Ning cookie information, a unique device or user ID, browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Ning Platform, and the "referring URL" (i.e., the page from which you navigated to the Ning Platform).
We also use cookies on the Ning Platform to recognize your account credentials, and to store references to your account credentials and session validators on your hard drive.
We also include clear GIFs in some of our email messages in order to learn whether the messages are delivered and opened.
==========
We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Ning Platform and our other services and systems, and to provide services and information that are tailored to you.
If any information gathered through passive means by Ning is combined with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
Otherwise, Ning uses information collected by passive means in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.
A third-party research company, Full Circle Studies (ScorecardResearch) uses web beacons and cookies to collect information about your use of Ning.
The web beacon and cookie used by ScorecardResearch is unable to identify the user visiting a page, and there is no personally identifiable data transmitted by, or linked to, the web beacon or cookies.
You can learn more about ScorecardResearch's privacy practices, and may opt-out from its browser-level tracking, here.
==========
Also, please be aware that other third parties, including advertising servers, advertising networks, Third Party Application Developers may set cookies or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services on the Ning Platform.
We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies or other means of passive data collection.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these Third Party Application Developers, advertising servers or advertising networks.
We cannot control the activities of such third parties.
4.
==========
Third Party Advertisers
We allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, such as Google AdSense, to serve advertisements within Networks on the Ning Platform.
These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within a Network on the Ning Platform and they automatically receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens.
Such third-party companies may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.
Certain third-party companies, such as Google, may also use these cookies to serve ads to you based on your visit to these Networks and other sites on the Internet.
We do not provide your Personal Information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.
==========
However, please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.
You may click here to visit the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page, where you can learn more about its member companies' practices and to opt out from the collection and use of information by its member companies.
Additionally, if any Google AdSense advertisements are used by Ning or Network Creators, you may opt out of Google's use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy located here.
We reserve the right to add or remove third-party ad networks and ad servers in our discretion.
We may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.
5.
==========
Information Received From Third-Party Sources
We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third-party sources.
This includes certain Personal Information that may be provided to us through the installation and use of Ning Applications on third party web sites.
If we directly combine information from other third parties with Personal Information that we collect on the Ning Platform, we will treat the combined information as "Personal Information" and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
6.
How Ning Uses Personal Information
We may use Personal Information to operate, provide, improve, and maintain the Ning Platform, and our other services and systems, and to develop new products and services; to prevent abusive and fraudulent use of the Ning Platform and our other services and systems; to personalize and display advertisements (via our own advertising engine or server) and other content on the Ning Platform; to send you administrative messages, and information about Networks, content, and Ning services in which we believe you may be interested; and for other administrative and internal business purposes.

9.
==========
Security
We use industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal Information under our control.
Although we make good faith efforts to maintain the security of such Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that it will remain free from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or alteration.
Further, while we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent "hackers" or other unauthorized persons from illegally accessing or obtaining this information.
We do not assume any liability to third parties whose information you include in your Address Book, or which you post or transmit in any Content on a Network.
