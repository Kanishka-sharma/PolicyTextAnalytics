Jampp Ltd (“Jampp”, “we”, “us”, “our”) provides solutions for app performance marketers.
This Privacy Statement is provided to help you understand how Jampp processes personal data on behalf of advertisers who use the Jampp platform.
It does not state the use practices or policies of our clients, of apps on which ads are shown, or of other parties.
Jampp and our customers care about how personal data is collected, used, and shared.
We are a “data sub-processor” that collects and analyzes personal data at the specific request of our customers (data controllers), through third party Mobile Measuring Platforms that act as “data processors”.
Jampp also collaborates with Programmatic Ad Exchanges that act as “data controllers”.
In this scenario, we are “data processors” (and “data co-controllers” in some specific cases).
This means we collect and securely forward data to be used for attribution to third party Mobile Measuring Platforms.
==========
Our Business
Jampp’s technology powers advertisements that can appear on web sites and applications on mobile phones or other devices connected to the mobile internet.
You may interact directly with our servers (for example, when you click on an ad) or indirectly via the mobile web site or application that displays the ads.
Personal Data
Personal data refers to any information about personal or factual circumstances of an identified or identifiable person.
This includes information and details such as your name, home address or other postal address, telephone number and also your e-mail address.
In the context of Jampp, personal data mostly refers to a smartphone device ID such as Google Advertising ID for Android phones or IDFA for iPhones.

Web analysis
Like almost all website operators, we use analytical tools in the form of tracking software to ascertain the number of users using our website and how frequently they visit.
To enable us to optimise our website and our service, we use Google Analytics, which is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”).
Google Analytics uses what are known as “cookies”: these are text files stored on your computer and used to analyse your website usage.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
However, if IP anonymisation is enabled on this website, within member states of the European Union, or in other states that are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area Google first abbreviates your IP address.
==========
The full IP address will only be transmitted in exceptional circumstances to one of Google's servers in the USA, where it will then be abbreviated.
Google will use this information on behalf of our website operator to analyse your use of the website in order to compile reports about website activities for the website operator and to perform other services connected with the use of the website and of the Internet.
The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged or combined with other data by Google.
You can prevent cookies from being stored by applying the appropriate settings in your browser software; please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their full extent.
