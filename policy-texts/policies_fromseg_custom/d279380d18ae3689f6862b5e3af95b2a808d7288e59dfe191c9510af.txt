We respect the privacy of our customers.
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we gather and how we use it.
In our ongoing effort to improve the products, services and features we provide to our customers, REI will continue to implement new technologies from time to time.
==========
As a result, this policy is subject to change without prior notice and we will post any revision on this web site.
We encourage you to review our privacy policy periodically.
When you do business with us or use our website, you accept this Privacy Policy.

PERSONAL INFORMATION
Personal information is information about a specific person, including the person's name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, birth date, information about the person's activities and purchases, and, if applicable, member number.
THE INFORMATION WE GATHER
When you become an REI member, and whenever you purchase products from REI, become a registered shopper, participate in our gift registry or request a catalog, we collect and store the personal information that you volunteer in our customer database.
Personal information is generally used to process your transactions, respond to your requests, and, if you are a member, calculate your member dividend.
==========
You may also receive periodic printed or e-mail communications from us about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events.
AGGREGATE DATA AND INFORMATION USAGE
In addition to personal information, we collect and store information about the products purchased by channel and the pages viewed by all of our website visitors.
==========
We then use this data in aggregate form to identify overall customer behavior patterns.
Our goal in using this information is to improve your experience at REI by being more responsive to the needs and preferences of our customers.
==========
Our Web servers automatically collect information about each visitor who requests REI Web pages, including your computer's internet protocol (IP) address.
This IP address allows us to identify your computer on the internet so that the Web content you request from us can be sent to you.
From time to time, we may provide portions of this aggregate site behavior information to vendors, consultants, potential advertisers or news agencies.
==========
We typically do this in order to demonstrate the amount of interest in REI and to plan for product and service improvements.
VOLUNTARY REGISTERED SHOPPER INFORMATION
Your REI Online Account is an optional service provided on REI's websites.
You do not have to register for Your REI Online Account in order to shop online with us.

REI partners with Coremetrics, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about your browsing or purchase behavior on our website.
The role of Coremetrics is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services to our customers.
==========
We may use click-stream data in the aggregate to provide improved services to groups of shoppers who behave similarly.
We may also use this data on an individual basis to improve your specific shopping experience.
For example, if during a visit to REI.com you read an online article about how to choose the right tent, we may during a subsequent visit present you with a how-to article on cleaning your tent or point you to a new product related to tent repair.
