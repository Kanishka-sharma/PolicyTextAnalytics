I. PRIVACY POLICY
mediabistro is committed to protecting the privacy of its users.
We do not share 
  our users' personal information unless you specifically authorize us to, or 
  unless required by law.
We do not derive any profit from selling or sharing 
  email addresses or personally-identifiable information to any other party.
The

  practices for the mediabistro.com Web site and all its site-related services 
  (collectively, the "Site") provided by mediabistro inc ("Mediabistro", "Mediabistro.com", 
  "we", "us") to you ("users", "visitors", "members").
By using the Site, you 
  express your agreement with these terms.
If you do not agree with these terms,

  7) How to contact us 

1) INFORMATION COLLECTED 
  We collect information from our users at several different points and in several 
  ways on our Web site.
a) Registration and Manage Account page 
  In order to use portions of this Web site, a user must first complete the registration 
  form.
During registration a user gives contact information (such as name and 
  email address).
We use this information to contact the user about services on 
  our site for which he has expressed interest.
b) Profile
  c) Job Alerts
  d) Post Resume 
  e) Order Forms 
  We request information from the user on our order form.
==========
A user must provide 
  contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial 
  information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
This information 
  is used only for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.
If we have 
  trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.
f) Surveys
 From time-to-time we may request information from users via surveys or 
  contests.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
  and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
The requested information may include contact information (such as name and 
  shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
==========
Survey information 
  will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction 
  of this site.
Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with 
  third parties unless we give prior notice and choice.
Though we may use an intermediary 
  to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable 
  information for any secondary purposes.
==========
g) Cookies 
  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information 
  about the user.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
Session 
  ID cookies are temporary files, deleted when the user closes his browser, that 
  are used to ease the user's navigation of the site, for instance by remembering 
  what pages have been viewed or what parts of a form have been completed.
Persistent 
  cookies are small files stored on the user's hard drive for extended periods 
  of time, which are used by mediabistro.com to identify returning users to the 
  site, and to speed up the login process for these users.
Persistent cookies 
  can be deleted by following the instructions in your Internet browser software.
Third-party advertisers may place and/or recognize cookies on our site.
However, 
  we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission 
  for them to set cookies for advertising
  h) Third Party Advertising Some ads appearing on this Web site are delivered 
  to users by Doubleclick, our Web advertising partner.
Information about users’ 
  visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not 
  user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to 
  users on this site.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by mediabistro.com 
  only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
==========
i) Log Files 
  Like most standard Web sites we use log files.
These files record site visitors' 
  internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), 
  referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.
Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement 
  in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
They are not linked to personally identifiable information.
==========
j) Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) 
  We employ [or our third party advertising company employs] a software technology 
  called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage 
  content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are 
  tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and 
  are used to track the online movements of Web users.
Clear gifs are not tied 
  to users’ personally identifiable information.
==========
2) COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE

    a) Special Offers and Updates 
    We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username.
Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, 
    special deals, and a newsletter.
Out of respect for the privacy of our users 
    we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
==========
Please 
    see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
b) Newsletter If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask 
    for contact information such as name and email address.
Out of respect for 
    our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.
Please 
    see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
==========
c) Service Announcements On rare occasions it is necessary to send 
    out a strictly service related announcement.
For instance, if our service 
    is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.
Generally, 
    users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate 
    their account.
However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
==========
d) Customer Service We communicate with users on a regular basis, including 
    by email, to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating 
    to users' accounts.
3) SHARING OF INFORMATION

    mediabistro.com will not share any user's information with any other party, 
    except for in the following limited instances: 
    a) Disclosure specifically authorized by the User For instance, if 
    you opt to have your Email Address linked to your postings on the Bulletin 
    Board, it will then be viewable by other visitors to the Bulletin Board section 
    of the Site.
Or, if you place a Resume on the Site, and then distribute the 
    unique URL for that Resume to others, the resume will then be viewable on 
    the Site to any web browser which goes to that URL.
==========
b) Legal Compliance 
    Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose 
    personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief 
    that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, 
    a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
c) Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable) 
    We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
==========
d) Third Party Advertisers (non-personally identifiable)
    mediabistro inc. shares Web site usage information about users with Doubleclick 
    for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site 
    and other sites.
For example, mediabistro inc. uses cookies and clear GIFs 
    on this site, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits 
    this site.
The information they collect and share through this technology 
    is not personally identifiable.
==========
If you would like more information about this 
    practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by 
    these companies, please click here.
e) Third Party Payments 
    We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
    information for any secondary purposes.
==========
f) Other Service Providers 
    We currently partner with third-party service providers, (such as eRSVP.com, 
    which provides us with event-management services).
When the user employs or 
    participates in these particular services, we share names, or other contact 
    information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
    except for the purpose of providing these services.
==========
g) Business Transitions 
    In the event mediabistro inc. goes through a business transition, such as 
    a merger, being acquired by another company, or bankruptcy, users’ personal 
    information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
Users 
    will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their 
    personal information.
If as a result of the business transition, the users’ 
    personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from 
    that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent 
    with our notification of changes section.
==========
4) CHOICE / OPT-OUT

  a) Choice/Opt-out 
  Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and other communications 
  may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing us 
  or by going to the Manage Account page in the Members Center (http://www.mediabistro.com/memberscenter).
b) Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information 
  If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, 
  email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide 
  a way for the user to correct, update or delete this information.
This can be 
  done at the Members' Center (http://www.mediabistro.com/memberscenter) or by 
  emailing us.
==========
c) Resumes 
  Any resume a user creates on or uploads to the Site will be kept there until 
  deleted by the user.
Once deleted, a resume will not be used by mediabistro.com 
  for any purpose, or in any way made available to other parties.
5) NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY 

  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
  privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our 
  users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
  what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We will use information in accordance 
  with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
If, however, 
  we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different 
  from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email.
Users 
  will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
  manner.
However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, 
  or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will 
  their personal information be used in this new manner.
In addition, if we make 
  any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information 
  already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site 
  notifying users of the change.
In some cases where we post a notice we will 
  also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying 
  them of the changes in our privacy practices.
==========
6) LINKS, SECURITY

  a) Links 
  This Web site contains links to other sites.
Please be aware that we, mediabistro 
  inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
We 
  encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
  statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable 
  information.
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
  by this Web site.
b) Security 
  This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
When 
  users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected 
  both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter 
  sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), 
  that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software 
  in the industry - SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock 
  icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer becomes locked.
==========
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive 
  information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
  off-line.
All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information 
  mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information 
  to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a 
  secure environment.
