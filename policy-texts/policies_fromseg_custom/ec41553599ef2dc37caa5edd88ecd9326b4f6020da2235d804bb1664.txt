          information about the user.
We will not use cookies to collect
          personal identification information from our users.

The Company may
          transfer user information to third parties when necessary to provide a
          product or service that a user orders from such third party while

We reserve the right to make such information

Security
We agree to use commercially reasonable
          efforts to protect the information you have provided to us from
          unauthorized access by using encryption and other security measures.
Our computers are protected by an advanced firewall system and access
          is limited to a small group of administrators.
Although we take
          reasonable efforts to make our network secure, the Site cannot
          guarantee that the security measures in place will stop third-party
          “hackers” from illegally accessing your information.
We are dedicated
          to providing our users with the highest level of security.
We
          encourage you to contact us if you are interested in learning more
          about our security measures.

          activities offered on the sites their children visit.
