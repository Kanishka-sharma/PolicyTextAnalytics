It is not sufficient consent to receive email correspondence from you if a person or organization participates in a survey or registers for an event, clicks "Like" on your Facebook® page, or "follows" you on Twitter®.
If you have used our feature that allows you to request a recipient to confirm that you have the recipient's permission to send messages to such recipient (assuming such use is permitted by laws applicable to you), and such recipient has not responded or does not respond affirmatively to such request for confirmation, you agree that you shall not send messages to that recipient.

You agree that you will not remove, disable or attempt to remove or disable either link.
