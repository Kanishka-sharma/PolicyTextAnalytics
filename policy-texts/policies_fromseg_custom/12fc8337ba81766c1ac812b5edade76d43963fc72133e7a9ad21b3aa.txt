At Capital One we understand that the protection of consumers' privacy is an important public concern.
Accordingly, we have adopted this Privacy Statement to serve as the foundation for our internal privacy policies and procedures.
It is our commitment to providing meaningful privacy protection for our customers.
==========
Information Quality
We maintain procedures to assure that the personal information we collect is accurate, up-to-date and as complete as possible.
If we obtain information about consumers who are not our current customers, we strive to treat this information in the same manner as we treat information about our existing customers.
Use Of Customer Information *
We collect personal information from our customers themselves, from when we provide products or services to our customers, and from consumer reporting agencies and other outside sources.
We use personal information only for purposes of administering our business activities, providing service, and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers.
==========
Do Not Solicit Option
We recognize that some of our customers do not want to be solicited for offers and promotions from us.
So, we provide our customers the option to have their names and addresses removed from our mail and/or telephone solicitation lists.
We have procedures that assure a consumer's name, address, and telephone number are removed from our marketing lists.
==========
Information Security
We maintain technical and organizational safeguards to protect the confidentiality of personal information about our customers against (i) unauthorized access or disclosure, and (ii) accidental loss, alteration, or destruction.
Maintaining Customer Privacy With Our Business Partners
We strive to ensure that the companies we use as our business partners support our commitment to privacy protection in their handling of personal data about our customers.
Employee Education
We provide training to our employees about their responsibilities under this Privacy Statement, and we expect them to do their parts in protecting our customers' privacy.
==========
We also conduct regular internal audits to support our commitment.
Privacy Statement Is Available to Customers
We want our customers to know about our commitment to providing privacy protection.
Therefore, this Privacy Statement is available upon request to customers, shareholders, employees, governmental authorities, and members of the general public.
