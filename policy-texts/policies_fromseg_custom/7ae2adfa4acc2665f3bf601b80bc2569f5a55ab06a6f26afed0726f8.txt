We may share your Personal Information with business  partners, but only to the extent you have purchased product or  service from such partner,  interacted  with such partner, or otherwise authorized  the sharing.
For  example, if you are referred to ADP from a business partner website, we may  provide that partner with your Contact Information and certain Transactional  Information to validate the referral.
We may also provide your Contact Information to companies that offer  complementary products and services if you request information about these  solutions.
