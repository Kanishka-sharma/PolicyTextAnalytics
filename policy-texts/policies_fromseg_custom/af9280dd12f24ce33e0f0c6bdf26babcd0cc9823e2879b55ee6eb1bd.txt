Collection of Information Using Cookies and Other Tools
Dell EMC may collect and/or log your Internet Protocol address, Internet domain name, the web browser and operating system used to access Dell EMC websites or applications, the pages or files visited, the time spent in each page or file, and the time and date of each visit or use.
==========
Dell EMC may collect this information automatically as you browse our websites or use our applications through the use of log files, web beacons, or other electronic tools.
Dell EMC may also use cookies and other electronic tools to automatically collect information about your use of our websites, applications, or emails.
Cookies are text files that are sent from a website via your browser and placed on your computer's hard drive or your mobile device.
==========
Thereafter, when you visit that website, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the website, and this information about your activities is stored in the cookie.
The information collected through cookies and other electronic tools (e.g., the web pages you visit on the website and navigation patterns, the date and time of your visit, the number of links you click within the site, the functions you use on the site, the databases you view and the searches you request on the site, the data you save on, or download from, the site, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting the site, and when you open our emails or click on any of their links) is used and analyzed to improve our service to you and to personalize your web-browsing experience by providing Dell EMC with a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites and applications.
The information collected through cookies and other electronic tools may be linked to your personal information, such as your email address or password.
We may also use cookies and other electronic tools placed by a third-party service provider to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and other information and to help us understand what product information is of most interest to you and what kinds of advertising offers you like to see.
==========
Although the service provider logs the information coming from our websites or applications on our behalf, Dell EMC controls how that data may and may not be used.
If you do not want to assist Dell EMC in improving our products, offers, and marketing strategy, you can opt out of this website analysis tool with respect to mobile applications and EMC.com by clicking here.
Websites of Dell EMC subsidiaries or divisions may use similar tracking tools for similar internal business purposes only.
These websites may not offer this opt-out functionality.
==========
Dell EMC also does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who visit our websites or use our applications.
However, if you wish to opt out of targeted ads for any Dell EMC websites covered by the TRUSTe program, you may opt out by clicking here (or, if you are located in the European Union, click here).

You may also elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your web or mobile browser.
Or you can set your browser to notify you when you are being sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
The help function on most browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies, or disable cookies entirely.
==========
However, disabling cookies in either manner may prevent you from using certain functions and features of websites, and the advertising you receive when you visit the site may not be advertisements tailored to your interests.
We or third-party advertisers or their advertising servers may also place or recognize unique cookies on your computer or use other electronic tools in order to help display advertisements that you see on our websites.
Information about your visits to, and activity on, our websites, an IP address, the number of times you have viewed an advertisement, and other such usage information is used, alone or in combination with other information, to display on your computer screen advertisements that may be of particular interest to you.
The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and their advertising servers is not covered by this Privacy Statement.
