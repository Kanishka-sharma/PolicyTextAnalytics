Information About the Cable Act

		To the extent that Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Cable Act") applies to services you purchase, it entitles you to know about the personally identifiable information a cable service provider collects.
This includes the nature of the use and disclosure of this information and to whom it may be disclosed, how long personally identifiable information is maintained, and how subscribers may access it.
In addition, the Cable Act imposes limits on the collection and disclosure of personal information and gives subscribers the ability to enforce their privacy rights.

(Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person).
The Cable Act allows a provider to use its cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render a cable service or other services provided to subscribers and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services.
Additional personally identifiable information may be collected with the subscriber’s prior consent.
Personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber’s consent where necessary to render services, and to conduct legitimate business activities related to services provided.
We may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, such as warrants, court orders or subpoenas, but we will not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order.

		Working Together to Keep Children Safe

		Verizon recognizes that online service providers must be vigilant in protecting the safety and privacy of children online.
We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under the age of 13, without obtaining verifiable parental consent.
Verizon strongly supports educating parents and young Internet users on safe viewing practices and we offer a variety of tools to help children and parents avoid encountering objectionable content or communications while using our services.

If you have a complaint about child pornography, the soliciting of children for sexual activity, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children on a Verizon service, report it to us by sending an email to abuse@verizon.net.
Please include the words "child porn" in the subject line of your email.
