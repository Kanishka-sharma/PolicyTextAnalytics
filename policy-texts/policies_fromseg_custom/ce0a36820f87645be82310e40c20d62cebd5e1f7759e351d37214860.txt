Quantcast provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information we receive through our website at www.quantcast.com (the “Quantcast.com Site”), as well as through our market research services, which collect and analyze data across the Web through the Quantcast Tags (“Market Research Services”), and our content and relevant advertising delivery service (“Delivery Service”) (the Market Research Services and the Delivery Service, collectively, the “Services”).
This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide to us when you use our Quantcast Measurement Program (a “Quantcast Client”), but also when you simply access or use any information or content appearing on the Quantcast.com Site, whether as a registered user (a “Registered User”) or as a non-registered user just browsing the Quantcast.com Site (a “Quantcast Visitor”).

We may change the Privacy Policy from time to time.
Please consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates.

Log Data
“Log Data” means information sent by your browser such as your computer’s IP address, pixel code, referring HTTP location, current HTTP location, search string, time of the access, browser’s time, any searches made on the applicable website, and other statistics.
When you visit the Quantcast.com Site, whether as a Quantcast Client, Registered User or Quantcast Visitor, our servers automatically record and collect Log Data sent by your browser.
We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze the use of the Quantcast.com Site and the Services, for the Quantcast.com Site’s technical administration, to increase the Quantcast.com Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.
==========
For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Quantcast.com Site again, it will recognize you and will be able to serve content, advertisements, and other information appropriate to your interests.
We also collect Log Data each time you visit third-party websites serving content that has been tagged by Quantcast Clients with Quantcast Tags.
We analyze Log Data from different websites and combine it with other non Personally Identifiable Information to produce the Reports that are made available on the Quantcast.com Site, to enable web publishers and advertisers to deliver audience segments that are appropriate for their products or services.
This combined data is also used by us and our partners to serve you content, advertisements, and other information tailored to your interests.
Our clients use our Market Research Services to understand their current and historical audience characteristics and we retain Log Data for this purpose indefinitely.
We retain the ability to use Log Data to provide our Delivery Service for 13 months to accommodate seasonality.
We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity.
==========
We make efforts to require our Quantcast Clients to ensure that any such third party website post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights of their visitors.
Check the privacy policies of websites tagged with Quantcast Tags for information regarding the applicable privacy practices.
