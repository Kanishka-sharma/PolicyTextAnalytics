Questions About This policy
Scope of This Policy
Six Flags collects certain information about or related to you through this Site.
Some of the information Six Flags collects may be “personal information”—information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us.
Other information may be nonpersonally identifiable, such as your IP address or operating system.
Six Flags has provided this Policy so that you will know what information Six Flags collects, how Six Flags uses this information, the types of third parties with whom Six Flags may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.
This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”), provided at the time we collect your information.
For example, certain pages of this Site may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.
In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the countries, provinces, or states in which we do business.
Your Consent
By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you).

This Policy describes some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “cookies.”
We may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your information.
==========
Do Not Track Mechanisms.
California law requires this Policy to address how we respond to any “Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) signal” delivered by your browser.
Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.
==========
Previously Expressed Preferences.

For example, you can opt out of promotional emails we send to you by selecting the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each communication.

Location Data
When you download the App, we may ask your permission to track your precise, real-time location.
If you consent, we may track your location even when you are not using the App.
You may change your location-tracking preferences at any time through the settings on your device or through the settings section in the App.
Such location-tracking services may be erroneous, inaccurate, incomplete or time-delayed.
==========
This Policy May Change
Six Flags reserves the right to update or modify this Policy and any Privacy Notice, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site.
These changes will only apply to the information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site.
Your use of this Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you after the revised Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Policy.

==========
Any personal information contained in UGC can be read, collected, or used by others.

If you choose to take advantage of this functionality, people with access to your profile on the third-party platform may be able to see the actions you have taken—for example, the comments you have posted or the items you have purchased.
Thus, you should have no expectation of privacy in those actions.
Further, if you choose to link your profile on this Site with an account on a third-party social media platform, we may share the information in your profile with that third-party platform.
==========
With Other, Carefully Selected Business Partners.

Before doing so, however, we may offer you the opportunity to “opt out” or “opt in,” as required by applicable law.
If you do not opt out, your Personal Information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your Personal Information.
==========

Third parties typically use this information for analytical purposes and to market their own products and services.
It is possible that third parties will attempt to “re-identify” de-identified data, and you should know that this is possible using external points of reference.
