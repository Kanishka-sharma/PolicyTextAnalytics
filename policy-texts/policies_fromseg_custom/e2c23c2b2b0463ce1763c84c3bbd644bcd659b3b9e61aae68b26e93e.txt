Read Pandora's Privacy Policy

							To make it a bit easier to digest our Terms of Use, we thought we'd start by highlighting in plain English some of the issues.
This summary is not a legal document.
Of course you'll want to read the complete Terms of Use, but here is what we think is important: 
						
Terms:


								You must be at least 13 years old to open a Pandora account.
Pandora can only be used in certain countries.
We expect you to keep your account password to yourself.
Except as set forth below in Section 2.1, Pandora is for personal use only.
==========
That means you can't play Pandora for the patrons in your bar, coffee shop, etc.
You can't use Pandora to steal music or other content, and you have to listen to it through pandora.com or on a device officially supported by Pandora.
Do not use Pandora if you do not agree to the Terms of Use.
Your use of Pandora means you agree to the Terms of Use.
