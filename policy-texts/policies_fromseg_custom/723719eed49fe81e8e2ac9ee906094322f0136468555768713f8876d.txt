Scoota takes very seriously the interest of its clients, advertisers, publishers and users in how information is collected and used.
Please read the following privacy notice to learn more about Scoota’s online information collection practices and use.
This privacy notice governs Scoota’s online information collection and use practices and does not apply to any information a user may provide to Scoota or that Scoota may collect offline and/or through other means.
Scoota reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time and without notice.
If we change our privacy policy, we will make every effort to post those changes in this area so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
==========
Scoota places brand-funded content onto the internet for the benefit of the user.
Brand-funded content allows the internet to offer broader interest to the user.
Advertising is the fundamental source of finance for a very large number of Internet companies and premium content providers.
When an Ad is requested, the ad server receives information from the user’s browser which influences which ad is sent back.
==========
The registration, collection and use of this information are subject to stringent data protection regulations under the Data Protection Act 1998.
Scoota uses Cookies to store only non-personally identifying information such as the computer’s IP address, type of computer’s operating system, type of internet browser software, what web pages were viewed and the time and geographic location of a user’s internet service provider.
The Cookies that Scoota collect do not contain your name, address, phone number, email address, or anything that personally identifies you unless you intentionally provide us with that information.
==========
Collecting this data enables us to measure the delivery of creatives and to report accurate results to our clients.
We also may use this data acquired in the individual networks internally, for statistical purposes.
Scoota uses certain methods to collect non-personally identifiable data as described in the following subsections.
In all cases, our collection of such data is based on the unique numeric ID and does not allow us to gather personally identifiable information.
“web beacons” – used in conjunction with cookies to collect click-stream data that we use for ad delivery and reporting purposes, as well as track how you interact with an ad displayed on our Network
“server logs” – Scoota collects information through its web servers and server logs when an ad on our Network is displayed to you
“third party data providers”  – Scoota may supplement the information it collects with other non-personally identifiable information provided to Scoota by our Network Sites and other third party data providers.
The types of information may include your age, gender and your interests but does not include personally identifiable information.
==========
“other third party service providers”  – In connection with our services, Scoota may engage third parties to provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf.
In connection with those relationships, such third parties may collect data on our behalf.
In that case, the third party would only collect and use such information as instructed by us and otherwise in accordance with this policy.
==========
“P3P” – Scoota Ads are delivered via P3P-compliant Ad servers that communicate the details of this practice to P3P-enabled web browsers such as Internet Explorer 6.0.
Scoota allows users to opt out of having online ads tailored using the Scoota ad-serving cookie.
Blocking and/or opting out of cookies will not stop advertisements from being served to your computer – it prevents data from being associated with your browser.
Please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, we will be unable to recognise your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad multiple times.
The opt-out cookie will apply to the specific browser you are using; if you wish to opt out for other browsers or computers that you use, you must repeat the process using these browsers or computers.
All other cookies associated with your browser will remain intact and your opt-out will be effective with respect to the browser used as long as you do not delete the cookie file from your hard drive.
This opt-out process will erase the cookie ID but not the cookie.
It is necessary for us to store this “Keep Out” cookie on your computer in order to recognize you as an opt-out user.
Please note that if you erase all cookies from your computer, you will also erase our opt-out cookie and will need to repeat the process of opting out.
If you’ve previously opted out, and would like to reverse your setting,  click here <http://rockaboxmedia.com/opt-in> to opt back in.
