General
We at the D2L family of companies (“we” or “us”) are committed to protecting the privacy of our users.
This Privacy Statement applies to personal information collected (1) at D2L Web sites and other sites that we own or control that link to this policy (“D2L Web sites”), (2) for or by D2L enterprise offerings that are hosted by D2L or its service providers, and (3) for or by D2L consumer offerings.
There are two main classes of users of D2L offerings: enterprise users and consumer users.
Enterprise users access offerings by virtue of an agreement that we have with the user’s employer, institution (educational or otherwise) or other organization (“Organization”).
Consumer users access D2L offerings by virtue of an agreement directly with us.
If you are an enterprise user, this statement does not affect the terms of any agreement between you and your Organization.
==========
You should read and understand the terms of any privacy statements or policies that you enter into with parties other than us, including your Organization, as those policies may also explain how your personal information is used by those parties.
Please review this Privacy Statement to understand how the information you provide to us will be treated.
Consent to D2L Processing Information about You
By providing any information to us or sharing information with others (including sensitive information) you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement and any applicable user agreement (including an end user license agreement or service agreement) that allows us to process information about you.
==========
Collection of Personal Information
Personal information is information that can be used to personally identify you or is associated with any such information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, and so forth.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to information we collect in the aggregate.
Aggregated information does not identify you as an individual.
==========
We may collect personal information from you in the following ways:
Registration
In order to access some D2L offerings, you will be asked to create an account (such as an D2L EduDentity™ account) which will require you to provide us with information that may include your name and email address and other personally identifiable information.
Information You Choose to Provide
Certain D2L offerings enable you to provide information about yourself or others.
Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is up to you, but providing additional information may enable you to derive more benefit from D2L offerings.
==========
Customer Service and Support
We may collect information about you if your Organization has contracted with us for end-user support and you use that support, or if you are an approved support contact (“ASC”) under our agreement with your Organization and you contact our help desk.
This information may include your name, email address or other personally identifiable information.
We may collect information about you if you contact us for email or other support for a D2L consumer offering.
Web Sites, eCommerce and Other Marketing Initiatives
At some D2L Web sites, we ask you to provide information, such as your email address, name, employer name, home or work address, or telephone number.
We may also collect demographic information, such as your postal or zip code, gender, age, preferences, interests and favorites.
==========
We may collect personal information from you such as your name, email address, telephone number and Organization information when you sign up for webinars, product trials, newsletters, our annual FUSION users’ conference, contests or other marketing initiatives through the D2L Web sites.
If you choose to make a purchase (including through the D2L Online Store) or sign up for a conference or seminar, a paid subscription service or a consumer offering, we may ask for additional information, such as your credit card information, billing address, shipping address.
When you join the Brightspace Community and the D2L Partner Community , we collect information such as your name, Organization and email address.
You can also populate your community profiles with information beyond that provided during registration such as photos or other personally identifiable information.

When you post a comment on our Learning Insights blog you may share information within your comment, along with the name you provide with the general public.

Cookies and Web Beacons
Like most Web sites, we use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take in using D2L offerings and D2L Web sites.
Information Collected by Third Parties
If you are an enterprise user, your Organization may collect information on its own through the use of D2L offerings.
Collection and use of information in this way is governed by the privacy policies of your Organization and is beyond our control.

Use of Personal Information
What We Do with Your Information
When you provide information, that information may reside on our or our service providers’ systems.
In addition to providing you the services or products that you have requested, we collect and use your information to operate and improve D2L offerings and D2L Web sites.
These uses include providing you with more effective customer service; making offerings easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving D2L offerings and technologies and D2L Web sites; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.
Some D2L offerings are accompanied by interactive features such as chat rooms, forums, messaging and other ways to share.
If you are an enterprise user, permissions as to what features are enabled and who has access to those features is determined by your Organization.
We have no control over those decisions.
If you are a consumer user, it is your choice whether to use the available functionality.
==========
Information collected through D2L offerings and D2L Web sites may be stored and processed by us, our affiliates or our service providers in Canada, the United States or Australia; the laws of the jurisdiction in which the information is stored and processed will apply to its storage and processing.
If you submit information through a D2L Web site, personal information you submit may be used to provide the services or products that you requested, and may also be used for related activities.
Related activities may include sharing your information to sales or marketing personnel who may contact you with further information that may be of interest to you.
When you receive newsletters or promotional emails from us, we may use web beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.
If you are an enterprise user:
Information collected through the use of our support service is intended to help resolve issues as quickly as possible, and to ensure that you can be notified of the progress of any issues that you describe.
Your Organization may use information that it has collected through the use of D2L offerings in a manner that is different from what is set out in this Privacy Statement.
Any use of your information by your Organization is subject to the privacy policies of your Organization and is beyond our control.

We may use your information to communicate with you.
We may send certain service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements.
Some D2L offerings may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service.
