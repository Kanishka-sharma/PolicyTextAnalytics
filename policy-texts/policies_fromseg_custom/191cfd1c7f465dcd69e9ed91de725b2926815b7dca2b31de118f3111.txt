Interest-Based Advertising:
When you use the Platforms, we, our service providers, and advertising partners may place cookies and similar tracking technologies on your computer or Device in order to collect information about your online web-browsing activities over time and across different websites and online services or mobile applications, in order to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests.
This form of advertising is referred to as Interest Based Advertising (“IBA”).
In order to personalize these ads or content, we or our advertising partners or service providers may connect and/or share personal information about you either to data you provided to us or to Browser/Usage/Device Information and Location Information collected about you.
You can opt out of being tracked online for IBA purposes by going to http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2⟨=EN or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1.
You can opt out of being tracked for IBA purposes on mobile apps by going to https://youradchoices.com/appchoices.Another way to opt out of IBA is by clicking on the Advertising Options Icon featured on certain iHeartMedia ads on third-party websites.
When clicked it (i) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant party website and (ii) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the other parties listed for the purposes of IBA.
==========
Choices you make are device-specific and browser-specific.
If you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and Devices, you will need to opt out of IBA from each browser on each of the computers and Devices that you use.
Please note that even if you opt out of IBA, you may still receive advertisements from us; they just won't be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites.
Please also note that if you opt-out of IBA, we may still track your visits to the Platforms for our own analytics, operations and security purposes.
Do Not Track:
Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
These features are not yet uniform, and our systems are not configured to recognize Do Not Track headers or signals from some or all browsers.
