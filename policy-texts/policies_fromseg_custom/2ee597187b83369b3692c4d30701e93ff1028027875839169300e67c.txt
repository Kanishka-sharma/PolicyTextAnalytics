Mobile.
A company may also use Adobe Marketing Cloud technologies within its mobile apps.
These technologies allow the company to send information to its Adobe Marketing Cloud account -- for example, how you use the company’s mobile apps as well as other information your mobile device may make available to apps, such as location information.
For more information, please review the privacy policy of the company as well as privacy information provided by your mobile device manufacturer.

Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op.
The Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op is a data co-operative that enables participating Adobe Marketing Cloud companies to better recognize their consumers across devices.
Each participating company provides the Co-op with technical information, such as cryptographically hashed login IDs and HTTP header information, about its consumers.
But no personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or phone number is shared with the Co-op.
The Co-op then combines and processes the technical information to recognize when multiple devices are used by the same individual (who is not personally identifiable by the Co-op), and creates links among those devices.
These device links are used by participating companies to link devices they have already seen visit their sites or advertising, and to provide consistent experiences and marketing activities across the devices.
You can learn more about how the Co-op works or opt-out.
==========
Interest-Based Advertising.
Adobe is a member of the following interest-based advertising self-regulatory groups:
Australian Digital Advertising Alliance (ADAA)
Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)
Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)
Adobe complies with the member requirements of these groups, including the NAI Code of Conduct and other applicable NAI guidance.
Please visit these groups' sites for more information about interest-based advertising, including how to opt out of companies' use of Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising solutions.
Please also see Your Privacy Choices to learn more about your choices for opting out of companies’ use of Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising solutions.

You may still receive ads from companies that use our advertising solutions, but they will no longer be based on your previous web browsing or likely interests.
==========
When you opt out, Adobe will place at least one opt out cookie on your browser.
If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or change devices, you will need to repeat this opt-out process.
Also, please note that this opt-out process will work only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies.
