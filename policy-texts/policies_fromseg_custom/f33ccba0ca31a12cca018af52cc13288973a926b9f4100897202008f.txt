This Cookie Policy (“Policy”) supports our belief in being transparent about how we use your information.
This Policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies on our Websites.

The Zendesk Group and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses the Websites has the best possible experience.

==========
What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server.
==========
Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used.
==========
You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below.
We update this list quarterly, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed.

==========
Why does Zendesk use Cookies?
When you visit our Websites, we may place a number of cookies in your browser.
These are known as First Party Cookies and are required to enable to hold session information as you navigate from page to page within the website.
For example, we use cookies on our Websites to understand visitor and user preferences, improve their experience, and track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information.
When We collect this information, We only use it to provide the Services or in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you, your Agents or End-Users personally.
We may use web beacons, tags, flash cookies, HTML5, and scripts in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
==========
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites.
Our third party partners may also use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, flash, HTML5, scripts, or other tracking technologies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests.
==========
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here and here (or if located in the European Union you may opt into the use of cookies, by clicking here).
Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic, untargeted ads.
Interest-Based Advertising – As described in this Policy, we and third parties may wish to use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect information and infer your interests for interest-based advertising purposes.
==========
You can manage your preferences with regards to the receipt of tailored advertisements in the cookie settings described below.
Please note if these cookies are switched off, you will continue to see advertisements, but they will no longer be tailored to your interests.
5.
==========
How to disable Cookies
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
If you elect not to activate the cookie or to later disable cookies, you may still visit our Websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of the Websites may be limited.

You can generally activate or later deactivate the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser.

==========
Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users/visitors as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies.
The Websites include third party social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and third party widgets, such as the ‘Share This’ button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Websites.
These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

==========
Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising:
To opt-out of interest-based advertising by third parties, please visit:

Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)’s self-regulatory opt-out page (http://optout.aboutads.info/) and mobile application-based “AppChoices” download page (https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) if you are located in the United States.
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)’s consumer opt-out page (http://youronlinechoices.eu) if you are located in Europe.
Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)’s self-regulatory opt-out page (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) if you are located in the United States.
==========
In the mobile environment, most mobile operating systems offer device-based opt-out choices that are transmitted to companies providing interest-based advertising.
To set an opt-out preference for a mobile device identifier (such as Apple’s IDFA or Android’s GAID), visit the device manufacturer’s current choice instructions pages, or read more about sending signals to limit ad tracking for your operating system here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.
==========
Please note that these settings must be performed on each device (including each web browser on each device) for which you wish to opt-out, and if you clear your cookies or if you use a different browser or device, you will need to renew your opt-out preferences.
We may use any of the following categories of cookies on the Websites as detailed below.
Cookie List
A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information.
Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies.
We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts.
More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:

Essential Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.
==========
You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.
These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
