The types of ‘special categories’ of Personal Information that we collect may vary depending on how you use this Website.
In some rare circumstances, we might gather special categories of Personal Information about you because you volunteer that data to us, or we are required to gather that data as a result of legal requirements imposed on us.
We will, where necessary, obtain your explicit consent to collect and use such information.

technological security measures, including fire walls, encryption and anti-virus software; and
physical security measures, such as staff security passes to access our premises.
Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your Personal Information, the transmission of data over the internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure.
We endeavor to protect Personal Information, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to us or by us over the internet.
