Some points about your privacy:
Unless you tell us otherwise, we treat the email address, name, physical address, and/or phone number of tipsters submitting information to tips@zerohedge.com as strictly Off the Record for the purposes of publication.
We assume the rest of the content of electronic mail sent to tips@zerohedge.com is On the Record for the purposes of publication unless you tell us otherwise.
We generally assume email to other addresses at Zero Hedge is On the Record.
If you didn't want us to print your name you'd send it to tips@zerohedge.com.
Duh.
Information sent to tips@zerohedge.com may be subject to disclosure in compliance with laws and/or regulations in the jurisdictions of Liechtenstein, Sweden or the Netherlands.
We sort of doubt it though.
These jurisdictions are notoriously unnosey.
==========
Still, if this bothers you, use hushmail.com and review the "How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters]" guide.
Zero Hedge, from time to time, may collect information from readers.
If you give it to us, we can use it.
==========
Duh.
Readers may, from time to time, post information on Zero Hedge.
Once you do that, *BAM!
* you grant us the right to use it (provided you had clean title to it in the first place) in perpetuity.
(That means forever).
Depending on what you want from Zero Hedge, we may require your email.
==========
(Hard to send you newsletters when we don't have it, for instance).
We occasionally use this data to screen out repeat registration and the like.
Lots of cool stuff on Zero Hedge requires cookies.
So we use those.
==========
You can clean them off if they scare you.
Our advertisers may use cookies.
We have no idea.
You can clean them off if they scare you.
We're fond of our logs.
We'll use them to expand the user experience and for your general benefit.
They do take space, however.
==========
So as time progresses, and we can dispose of them, we will, right after we see how often you click on Marla's bio in a 48 hour period.
It is entirely possible that some enterprising law enforcement official bucking for a promotion may actually attempt to compel us to to disclose data.
We don't even go to the Policeman's Ball so you can guess what our lawyer will say about this sort of thing.
Other sites we link to have less amusing and potentially less comprehensive privacy policies than we do.
Their policies are likely less user-friendly than ours too.
==========
Please don't piss off the locals wherever you may wander off to and don't assume everyone is as enlightened as we are on this topic.
If our policy is not sufficiently amusing, or you are humor impaired, you can send questions to: admin@zerohedge.com.
We reserve the right to modify any terms and conditions of userdom at any point, without notification.
Don't give us an email address or information for an account or otherwise that you don't want made public.
Don't give us any information at all that you don't want made public.
==========
You should have no expectation of privacy.
We make no guarantees with respect to privacy.
We disclaim all liablity regarding the making of your information public.
Use only anonymous information when registering and interacting with Zero Hedge.
Users may be banned or removed from the system without notification or due process of any sort.
