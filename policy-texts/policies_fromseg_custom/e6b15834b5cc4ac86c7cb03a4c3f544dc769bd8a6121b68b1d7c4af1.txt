We use a variety of technologies to help us better understand how you use Etsy.com and EtsyStudio.com (we'll refer to Etsy.com and EtsyStudio.com collectively as the "Site"), Etsy's mobile applications (the "Apps") and Pattern by Etsy, Etsy Payments, and our other services (we'll refer to Pattern by Etsy, Etsy Payments, and our other services collectively as the "Services").
We'll refer to the Site, the Apps, and the Services collectively as "Etsy" throughout this policy.
By using Etsy, you consent to us using cookies and similar tracking technologies in the ways described on this page.
Etsy adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
As part of our commitment to upholding a high standard of transparency in our Privacy Policy and practices, we've created this guide to explain the tracking technologies we use on the Site.
==========
Types of tracking technologies
There are a few common types of tracking technologies used on Etsy:
Cookies: This is a small data file sent from a server to your web browser or mobile device that is stored in your browser cache or mobile device.
You can configure your browser's settings to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies (see Managing Cookies below).
==========
Clear gifs, web beacons, web bugs: These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information.
==========
While Etsy does not currently employ Flash cookies, also known as local shared objects (LSOs), some third parties you interact with when using the Services may use these cookies, which are used to collect and store information, but differ from browser cookies in the amount, type, and manner in which data is stored.

==========
Tracking technologies have two different lifespans:
Persistent means it remembers certain information about your preferences for viewing the site, and allows Etsy to recognise you each time you return.
Persistent cookies are stored on your browser cache or mobile device until you choose to delete them.
Session, on the other hand, is specific to a particular visit to the site, to carry information as you view different pages on Etsy so you don’t have to re-enter information.
Session cookies expire and delete themselves automatically when you leave the Site or close your web browser.
Purposes
Etsy uses tracking technologies for a few general purposes:
Strictly necessary: Vital to ensuring that Etsy works properly for visitors and members (such as maintaining the security and integrity of the Site).
==========
Performance: Help us understand how the Site or the Apps are functioning so that we can improve our services.
Functionality: Retain your personal preferences as you use the Site or the Apps to enhance your experience.
Marketing and Advertising: Gather data to help deliver advertising content relevant to your interests.
==========
Etsy uses cookies to record what purchases members and visitors are interested in making and to make it easier for you to browse the Site whenever you visit.
Cookies also permit us to learn about what ads you see and click when you visit Etsy, the Apps, and affiliated sites, to limit the number of times you may see the same ad, or to show you more useful and relevant ads.
Etsy sometimes partners with third-party services who may use various tracking technologies to provide certain services or features, including targeted online marketing techniques such as attribution tracking, remarketing, and cross-device tracking.
Attribution tracking means estimating what advertising or marketing source a user followed to come to Etsy, or to determine what marketing source should get credit for actions like a visit or a purchase.
Remarketing means showing relevant ads to an audience based on prior shopping patterns on Etsy, whether or not the audience made a purchase.
Cross-device tracking means recognizing an audience across multiple devices or browsers.
Some of these third-party services may provide us with information about you (such as demographic information, cross-device information, or interest categories) from a combination of sources that permit us to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising.
==========
The Apps may include third party mobile analytics software and APIs that may be used to enhance our data, to improve the Services, or for marketing purposes.
These technologies allow a partner to recognise your computer or mobile device each time you visit Etsy, but do not allow access to personally identifiable information from Etsy.
However, these technologies may allow us or a third party to recognize you, either across devices or over time.
==========
Etsy does not have control over these third-party technologies, which maintain their own privacy policies, and they are not covered by our Privacy Policy, although we do require them to follow applicable laws and self-regulatory programs.
The Site may include widgets from third-party websites and social networks, and third parties may chose to include Etsy widgets on their websites.
Etsy, as well as the third party, may receive analytics from those widgets that may be used to enhance our data, to improve the Services, or for marketing purposes.
You can manage your privacy preferences for these widgets via your account with the third party.

If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based advertisements, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if you are located in the European Union click here).
==========
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertisements.
You will continue to receive generic advertisements.
==========
You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics here.
Please note that if you reject or block all cookies in your browser settings, you will not be able to take full advantage of Etsy's services as some cookies are necessary for the site to function properly.

You can learn more about managing your preferences for ads online, particularly for many third-party advertising networks, through resources made available by the Digital Advertising Alliance at https://www.aboutads.info/  or via the Network Advertising Initiative at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/.
If you access Etsy through the Apps, you may also opt out of interest-based advertising on an iOS or Android device by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” option in the settings of iOS or Android-based devices.
Note that opting out of this form of advertising will not prevent you from seeing advertisements, but will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests.
