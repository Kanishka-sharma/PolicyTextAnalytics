Revenue (share)
Subject to the requirements for payment set forth in this section, Publisher will receive a payment of the Net Revenue Share, on the net payment terms set forth in the MSA, related to the number of times an Ad is displayed on Publisher Properties (“Ad Impressions”).
Reporting related to Ad Impressions shall be made available to Publisher online.
Publisher acknowledges and accepts that JustPremium’s online reporting is an estimate and that the final measurements upon which Net Revenue payments are to be made may need to be adjusted at the end of each calendar month to account for, specific contractual provisions, statistical errors, and adjustments required by the purchasers of the Publisher Advertising Inventory.
JustPremium shall calculate the Net Revenue for which payment is due hereunder based solely on tracking of Ad Impressions (and related records and measurements) as compiled and maintained by JustPremium, related third party ad servers or the demand-side partners and participants utilizing the Services to place Ads on Publisher Properties.
In the event Publisher disputes the applicable tracking measurements and the amount in dispute is greater than 10% of the total Net Revenue for the applicable billing period, then the Parties will facilitate a reconciliation effort between two sets of server data and each party agrees to work in good faith to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days from the date the dispute arose.
JustPremium may withhold payment of the disputed amount(s) of the invoice, and shall remit to Publisher the undisputed amount(s) in a timely manner.
If the discrepancy cannot be resolved even though JustPremium has made a good faith effort to facilitate the reconciliation effort, JustPremium’s liability shall be no greater than 110% of the amount recorded by JustPremium’s measurements.
“Net Revenue Share” is the payment amount to Publisher based on the amount of revenue actually received by JustPremium for Ad Impressions served by JustPremium on Publisher’s Properties during the relevant calendar month as measured by JustPremium, net of value added taxes, other duties, associated third-party or governmental fees, revenue generated through Artificial Traffic, impressions, clicks or other invalid transactions or data fees.
JustPremium shall not be obliged to pay any Revenue Share to Publisher for any Ad Impressions or any other action which, pursuant to JustPremium reasonable assessment, may be: (i) based on Artificial Traffic, (ii) originating from Publisher’s IP addresses or computers or networks under Publisher’s control; or (iii) Ad Impressions for which JustPremium does not collect revenue from advertiser or party who initiated purchase for Publisher’s Advertising Inventory on the JustPremium Marketplace.
You acknowledge that any participation or attempted participation or violation of any of the foregoing is a material breach of the Agreement.
“Artificial Traffic” shall mean invalid, automated, deceptive or fraudulent Ad Impressions, which may, without limitation, be generated by or originating from any person or entity which may originate without limitation from automatic openings, spiders, robots, automated programs, browser toolbar, adware or spyware, requests in e-mail or chat rooms, or script generators.
==========
Unless otherwise agreed, in case the Parties have agreed on any prepayments or advances of the Revenue Share, such prepayment shall be set off against any Revenue Share accrued to Publisher under the Agreement until the prepayment has been fully recouped.
In case of expiry or termination of the Agreement prior to the full recoupment of the prepayment, Publisher shall repay to JustPremium the un-recouped amount of the prepayment immediately upon such expiry or termination.
4.
==========
Payments
JustPremium shall pay to Publisher the applicable Revenue Share according to the terms set forth in the Master Service Agreement, if the amount of outstanding receivables accumulated in or before the relevant month (“Balance”), is US $50 or more.
In the event that the Agreement is terminated, JustPremium shall pay Publisher any outstanding Revenue Share balance within 60 days from the termination of the Agreement, provided that JustPremium has collected the Net Revenue attributable to the applicable Publisher Revenue Share payments.
If such fees have not been collected by JustPremium within 60 days of the termination of the Agreement, it will make the outstanding Revenue Share payments for Publisher’s Advertising Inventory on the JustPremium platform payable to Publisher, within three business days of its receipt thereof.
==========
All amounts shall be payable in US Dollars unless agreed otherwise.
Before sending the Revenue Share payment, within 45 days from the end of the relevant billing period, JustPremium will provide Publisher with a statement setting forth the estimated Revenue Share to be paid.
Publisher acknowledges and agrees that such estimate is not binding and is subject to change, and that the actual Revenue Share payable to Publisher shall be finally determined only after JustPremium has collected the revenue attributable to the Ad Impressions delivered on Publisher’s Advertising Inventory through the JustPremium platform.
==========
The agreed Revenue Share is exclusive of any taxes or other official duties, which may be deducted from the Revenue Share.
Publisher agrees to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with its use of the JustPremium Service or receipt of the Revenue Share excluding JustPremium’s income taxes.
In case JustPremium has an obligation to pay withholding tax or other official charges based on the Revenue Share, JustPremium shall deduct corresponding amounts from actual payments made to Publisher.
Each Party shall be liable for its own applicable official charges as well as charges imposed by the bank or other credit institution engaged by the Party to send and receive payments under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of any doubt, JustPremium applies so-called shared bank charges to any payments under the Agreement, i.e. JustPremium is responsible only for the fees charged by JustPremium’s bank.
To ensure proper payment, Publisher is responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information in its Account.

Quality Control
LAST MODIFIED May 13, 2020
Brand safe inventory is of great importance to JustPremium.
Our process regarding publisher selection, and our ongoing inventory quality control have been designed to safeguard the interest of our buyers and uphold the reliability of the online industry and its eco-system.
As a responsible company, JustPremium is doing everything reasonably possible to protect the interests of our demand and supply partners.
Regarding brand safety, we are committed to meeting and where possible, exceeding industry standards, while also ensuring a high percentage of organic, human traffic within our inventory pool.
JustPremium’s Quality Control team is continually monitoring our internal quality control tools, reaching out to third-party verification providers, exchanging information with our buyers, ad tech partners and publishers, to face the daily and constantly evolving threats of criminal behaviour harming the eco-system.
==========
All of our advertising practices are in alignment with the guidelines set forth by the Coalition For Better Ads.
This means that our quality control teams are dedicated to providing users the best site experience for all of our publishing partners.
We are committed to showing less than 5 ads per page that are non-aggressive/non-intrusive and do not feature any prohibited content.
Viewability is monitored regularly on every site to ensure the best ad delivery.
==========
A combination of external and internal site exclusion lists allows us to deliver the most premium inventory through tracking of historical activity, bot traffic, or any other violation of our quality standards.
We also regularly track display traffic on our network with any traffic fraud rate higher than 10% being automatically excluded from the network.
Finally, we leverage other partner platforms to effectively keep a 360-degree view of any quality issues from sites within our network.
Publisher On-Boarding
Every JustPremium publisher is extensively reviewed by our internal Quality Control Team.
==========
Prospective publishers are evaluated against the following criteria:
Reputation: We conduct a background check to determine if any previous clients or users have had a negative experience with the publisher.
We want to ensure the publisher isn’t associated with fraudulent activities such as malware, adware, ad injection, etc.
Quality Assessment: A manual review of the publisher webpage(s) is carried out to check the quality of the page content.
We check if the web- site is updated on a regular basis with relevant content.
Does this publisher have any inappropriate content, such as adult or illegal content, hate content or copyright infringement?
Social Presence: We determine whether the publisher has an engaged audience by reviewing Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts
Sourcing Traffic: JustPremium requires all publishers to review our Guidelines against ad fraud.
Traffic Quality: Evaluation of the publisher’s traffic acquisition methodology using tools such as Alexa, SimilarWeb and IAS
JustPremium will connect web-sites that are in compliance with the Better Ads Standards developed by the Coalition for Better Ads.
==========
For more information, see www.betterads.org.

Publisher shall be regarded as controller who defines the purpose and parts of the means, and JustPremium as processor within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”).
Once publishers are connected, they are regularly monitored by our Quality Control Team and by various third-party verification vendors in the following areas:
Quality Assessment: Review of the publisher webpage(s) to check content: what is the quality of the page content?
==========
Is the website updated on a regular basis with relevant content?
Does the publisher have any inappropriate content, such as adult or illegal content?
Quality of Inventory: Review of publisher’s inventory based on various criteria:
◊  Ad injection, either through toolbars, browser extensions, adware, malware or any mechanism that generates revenues for an entity other than the publisher◊  Hidden ad and stack ads
◊  Inventory related to hate, nudity, graphic content, violence or illegal content, which includes sites that infringe on copyrights, file sharing sites, torrenting, pirating, peer2peer and warez.
==========
◊  Percentage of Non-human/bot traffic
◊  Masking/misrepresented URLs
◊ Our QC Team makes sure all Ads.txt are in place, correct, and updated so that publishers can maximize their revenues through true inventory
◊ In order to maintain the highest traffic quality, JustPremium combines some of the most updated and comprehensive exclusion lists provided by our trusted partners with our own proprietary list.
These lists are updated frequently to ensure JustPremium maintains the most premium network for publishers and advertisers alike.
Third-Party Partnerships
JustPremium collaborates with a number of Ad Tech Partners and buyers to safeguard the eco-system from non-human traffic and increase the availability of brand-safe inventory.
We receive weekly insights into extensive data and publisher exclusion lists through our trusted partners.
==========
Take Down Policy
As part of the Quality Control procedures, JustPremium has a very strict Take Down Policy.
If a buyer feels that specific inventory is in violation of their expectations, they must notify JustPremium immediately.
Within 12 hours, JustPremium will make commercially reasonable efforts to correct or take down the violation.
The contractual consequences of not taking down an ad in accordance with our Take Down Policy are evaluated and agreed upon with the buyer on a case-by-case basis.
If a publisher serves JustPremium ads on a domain that has not been previously agreed upon, sends non-brand safe traffic or +30% non- human traffic, cooperation will be suspended and a further investigation by our Quality Control Team will be conducted.
As a result of this investigation, the partnership between the publisher and JustPremium may be terminated immediately.

Revenue (share)
Subject to the requirements for payment set forth in this section, Publisher will receive a payment of the Net Revenue Share, on the net payment terms set forth in the MSA, related to the number of times an Ad is displayed on Publisher Properties (“Ad Impressions”).
Reporting related to Ad Impressions shall be made available to Publisher online.
Publisher acknowledges and accepts that JustPremium’s online reporting is an estimate and that the final measurements upon which Net Revenue payments are to be made may need to be adjusted at the end of each calendar month to account for, specific contractual provisions, statistical errors, and adjustments required by the purchasers of the Publisher Advertising Inventory.
JustPremium shall calculate the Net Revenue for which payment is due hereunder based solely on tracking of Ad Impressions (and related records and measurements) as compiled and maintained by JustPremium, related third party ad servers or the demand-side partners and participants utilizing the Services to place Ads on Publisher Properties.
In the event Publisher disputes the applicable tracking measurements and the amount in dispute is greater than 10% of the total Net Revenue for the applicable billing period, then the Parties will facilitate a reconciliation effort between two sets of server data and each party agrees to work in good faith to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days from the date the dispute arose.
JustPremium may withhold payment of the disputed amount(s) of the invoice, and shall remit to Publisher the undisputed amount(s) in a timely manner.
If the discrepancy cannot be resolved even though JustPremium has made a good faith effort to facilitate the reconciliation effort, JustPremium’s liability shall be no greater than 110% of the amount recorded by JustPremium’s measurements.
“Net Revenue Share” is the payment amount to Publisher based on the amount of revenue actually received by JustPremium for Ad Impressions served by JustPremium on Publisher’s Properties during the relevant calendar month as measured by JustPremium, net of value added taxes, other duties, associated third-party or governmental fees, revenue generated through Artificial Traffic, impressions, clicks or other invalid transactions or data fees.
JustPremium shall not be obliged to pay any Revenue Share to Publisher for any Ad Impressions or any other action which, pursuant to JustPremium reasonable assessment, may be: (i) based on Artificial Traffic, (ii) originating from Publisher’s IP addresses or computers or networks under Publisher’s control; or (iii) Ad Impressions for which JustPremium does not collect revenue from advertiser or party who initiated purchase for Publisher’s Advertising Inventory on the JustPremium Marketplace.
You acknowledge that any participation or attempted participation or violation of any of the foregoing is a material breach of the Agreement.
“Artificial Traffic” shall mean invalid, automated, deceptive or fraudulent Ad Impressions, which may, without limitation, be generated by or originating from any person or entity which may originate without limitation from automatic openings, spiders, robots, automated programs, browser toolbar, adware or spyware, requests in e-mail or chat rooms, or script generators.
==========
Unless otherwise agreed, in case the Parties have agreed on any prepayments or advances of the Revenue Share, such prepayment shall be set off against any Revenue Share accrued to Publisher under the Agreement until the prepayment has been fully recouped.
In case of expiry or termination of the Agreement prior to the full recoupment of the prepayment, Publisher shall repay to JustPremium the un-recouped amount of the prepayment immediately upon such expiry or termination.
4.
==========
Payments
JustPremium shall pay to Publisher the applicable Revenue Share according to the terms set forth in the Master Service Agreement, if the amount of outstanding receivables accumulated in or before the relevant month (“Balance”), is EUR 50 or more.

==========
All amounts shall be payable in Euros unless agreed otherwise.
Before sending the Revenue Share payment, within 45 days from the end of the relevant billing period, JustPremium will provide Publisher with a statement setting forth the estimated Revenue Share to be paid.
Publisher acknowledges and agrees that such estimate is not binding and is subject to change, and that the actual Revenue Share payable to Publisher shall be finally determined only after JustPremium has collected the revenue attributable to the Ad Impressions delivered on Publisher’s Advertising Inventory through the JustPremium platform.
The agreed Revenue Share is exclusive of any taxes or other official duties, which may be deducted from the Revenue Share.
==========
Publisher agrees to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with its use of the JustPremium Service or receipt of the Revenue Share excluding JustPremium’s income taxes.
In case JustPremium has an obligation to pay withholding tax or other official charges based on the Revenue Share, JustPremium shall deduct corresponding amounts from actual payments made to Publisher.
Each Party shall be liable for its own applicable official charges as well as charges imposed by the bank or other credit institution engaged by the Party to send and receive payments under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of any doubt, JustPremium applies so-called shared bank charges to any payments under the Agreement, i.e. JustPremium is responsible only for the fees charged by JustPremium’s bank.
To ensure proper payment, Publisher is responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information in its Account.
