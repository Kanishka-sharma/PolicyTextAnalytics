How we Collect this Information?
==========
AdUnity uses Cookies and Web Beacons to give a unique ID to every browser visiting our website or displaying one of our ads.
We use this ID to match it to information we have on our server, such as type of browser and screen resolution of device of user.
AdUnity does NOT use this ID in conjunction with any Personal Information.

Why Collect Non-Personal Information?
The Non-Personal information we collect is primarily used by our clients to trade online advertising, including interest-based advertising and/or real-time bidding.
==========
The main reason why this is important is because we aim to make advertising appropriate and relevant to the user of any website and we do this by researching visiting patterns and targeting advertisements based on user interests.
Since advertisers are willing to pay more money for such appropriate and relevant advertising this means more money going to the websites visited by Internet users.
Please note that website publishers use advertising to pay for the costs of running their sites.
==========
In addition Non-Personal Information is used to track the progress and participation in promotions as well as progress of orders (or other action, such as request for a test drive).
AdUnity may also use the Platform for advertising its own business.
What Information does AdUnity share with Third Parties?
In day-to-day operations AdUnity provides clients and partners with reports and analysis amalgamated and derived from the Non-Personal Information.
Our clients and partners use these reports and analysis to buy and sell online advertising on our Platform and how they do this is governed by our Terms and Conditions with our clients and by this Privacy Policy.
In addition AdUnity will share Non-Personal Information with third-parties where: required to do so by law; we reasonably suspect that it will uncover illegal or malicious activity; it is a necessary part of a corporate merger, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
==========
How and for How Long is the Information Stored?
The AdUnity Platform uses high security standards to protect Non-Personal Information and the limited amount of Personal Information we hold.
At all times we have security measures and technical safeguards in place to prevent unauthorised access, theft or loss of any personal or non-personal information, from both inside and outside our company.
Our employees are aware of and accountable for compliance with these procedures.
The length of time Non-Personal data is stored varies but in general it is kept no longer than 12 months in un-aggregated (raw) form.
Aggregated data which is used for reporting and analysis, and may be stored in the Platform for up to four years.
==========
What happens if this Privacy Policy is Changed?
AdUnity may make change to this privacy policy at any time.
The changes will be made public on our website.
If we were to make changes, those changes would not be applied to information collected prior to such changes.

Web Beacons: Web Beacons alternatively known as Web Bugs, Pixels or Pixel Tracking are event-trackers for visits and actions on a website.
A pixel can, for example, register a view of this page or confirm an online sale of a product after seeing an advertisement.
When a pixel is triggered, it stores its information in a cookie.
They are used to match visitor browsing behaviour to an audience segment profile designated for targeting ads to visitors.
See the Wikipedia description here.
==========
Interest-Based Advertising: Interest-based advertising uses information collected across multiple web sites to predict users’ preferences and to show ads that are most likely to be of interest to those users.
For example, if a user visits a sports site, they might see sport related ads on another site.
AdUnity offers web users choices with respect to the use of the AdUnity for this type of advertising.
==========
Personal Information: This sometimes called Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that by itself can be used to identify a specific individual.
PII includes such things as name, address, phone number, and email address.
Non-Personal Information: This is sometimes called Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that cannot by itself be used to identify an individual person.
==========
Non-Personal Information includes such things as browser type, operating system, the web address of a web page visited, the time and date a web page was visited, and the web address of the referring page.
It may also include the number of times a particular browser has been shown a particular ad, or it may include generic categories indicating inferences that have been made about users’ interests.
Real-Time Bidding: Advertising buyers are able to bid in “real time” for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded by a web browser.
The winning bidder gets to show their ad in the web page.
==========
Of course, the explanations above are simplified.
There are many resources available on the web to learn more about these concepts and online advertising in general.
