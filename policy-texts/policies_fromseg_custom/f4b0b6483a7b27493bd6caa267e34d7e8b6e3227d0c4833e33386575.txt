                                                in a single data string for each 
                                                Web page you visit.
Each string 
                                                is logged in our database in the

Does 
                                                Alexa collect personally identifiable 
                                                information?
The URLs 
                                                we collect sometimes contain personal 
                                                information about you.
For example, 
                                                when you enter information on 
                                                a Web page (e.g., when you complete 
                                                an online registration form or 
                                                sign up for a contest), the operator 
                                                of the Web site may insert that 
                                                information into its URL
for that or the next page.
This information often appears 
                                                after a question mark ("?")
in the URL, 
                                                although it can appear in other 
                                                places.

                                                of a URL
that is then transmitted to 
                                                Alexa and automatically stored 
                                                in Alexa's databases.
This can 
                                                also occur with words, topics,

                                                into search engines – whether 
                                                those engines are provided by

                                                the Alexa Service.
Alexa has no

                                                is collected and stored by Alexa 
                                                when you are using the Service.

                                                Alexa collect?
If you email 
                                                Alexa, we may store copies of

This can 
                                                result in the collection of your

We 
                                                further use cookies to determine

Your 
                                                Alexa cookie number is also used 
                                                to create usage and shopping paths

                                                Provider.
IP addresses are further 
                                                used to help determine the number 
                                                of Alexa users.
This demographic 
                                                information may also be used by 
                                                Alexa to analyze aggregate Web 
                                                usage behavior.
We use Web

                                                to build the Related

==========
We use 
                                                shopping paths to build the functionality 
                                                of our product information and 
                                                comparison shopping features.
We use both usage and shopping 
                                                paths and Amazon.com purchase

                                                and reports described below.
How does 
                                                Alexa share the information it 
                                                collects?
User privacy 
                                                has always been a core value of 
                                                Alexa.
That is why Alexa does 
                                                not attempt to determine the identity

We generally do not 
                                                inform users of such requests

We employ other

To perform those functions, it 
                                                may be necessary for them to obtain 
                                                access to Alexa’s databases and 
                                                servers, which may contain personally 
                                                identifying information about 
                                                users.
They may not use such access 
                                                or information for any purpose 
                                                other than that for which they

These risks, however,

                                                solely by our business partners 
                                                or other organizations, such as

The links 
                                                take you to pages provided solely 
                                                by those entities, although sometimes 
                                                the pages are co-branded with 
                                                the Alexa logo.
You will be able 
                                                to tell when another entity is 
                                                involved with providing features, 
                                                services, or Web pages, and any 
                                                information about your interaction 
                                                with those Web pages, including

                                                will be received by that other

Further, our 
                                                business partners may post advertisements 
                                                on pages co-branded with the Alexa

Glossary 
                                                of Terms
Related 
                                                Links

Related Links are lists of 
                                                Web sites that are related to 
                                                the Web site you are viewing.
Whenever you visit a Web page, 
                                                the Alexa service retrieves information 
                                                from the Alexa servers to suggest 
                                                other related Web pages that might 
                                                be of interest to you.
Alexa’s 
                                                Related Links enable you to “surf” 
                                                from one related site to another, 
                                                discovering interesting and unique 
                                                sites as you go, without having

Usage 
                                                Paths
 A usage path 
                                                is the trail of requests automatically 
                                                transmitted to and logged by Alexa 
                                                as a user surfs the Internet with 
                                                the Alexa toolbar enabled.
Usage 
                                                paths consist of the following 
                                                data for each Web page visited 
                                                by an Alexa user: (a) the IP address 
                                                assigned to the user; (b) the 
                                                date and time the Web page is 
                                                visited by the user; (c) the user’s 
                                                browser type and version; (d) 
                                                the user’s operating system and 
                                                version; (e) the user’s Alexa 
                                                cookie; and (f) the full URL 
                                                that the site assigns to the

Uniform 
                                                Resource Locator
 A URL (or 
                                                uniform resource locator) is the 
                                                full Web address of a file or 
                                                document you view when browsing 
                                                the Internet.
With most browsers, 
                                                such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 
                                                or Netscape Navigator, the URL 
                                                of every Web page that you view 
                                                is displayed in a window near 
                                                the top of the screen.
Typically, 
                                                a URL consists of four parts: 
                                                protocol, server (or domain) where 
                                                the file is located, path, and 
                                                filename.
However, some URLs have 
                                                no path or filename.
