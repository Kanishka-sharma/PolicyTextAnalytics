A.
==========
Our Pledge to You
When you sign up for a free trial, you will not be automatically subscribed to any promotional emails.
Your personal information (and your customer information) will be kept strictly confidential.
It is never sold, given away, or shared with anyone, unless we're required to by law.
We do not send promotional messages to you unless you explicitly request to receive them.
We may send you automated emails asking you if you'd like to activate, or de-activate your free trial (if you don't use it after a reasonable time period).
We like to remove dormant accounts from our system, to keep our database clean.
==========
In order to use MailChimp, you must first complete the "Free Trial" registration form and create a user name and password.
During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address).
We use this information to send you a confirmation link, which is used to activate your account.
You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.

==========
We NEVER Touch Your Customer Lists
Your recipient lists are stored on a secure MailChimp server.
We do not, under any circumstances, steal your list, contact your list, market to your list, sell your list, or share it with any other party, unless required to by law.
Your recipient list is kept strictly confidential.
Only carefully selected, authorized personnel have access (for customer service and abuse-monitoring purposes) to view system accounts and campaigns.
We do not hold your lists hostage, and we do not make it difficult to reclaim them.
You may export (download) your lists from MailChimp at any time.
==========
They are your property.
C. Transactional and Mandatory Emails That We'll Be Sending You
These are the types of emails you can expect to receive from MailChimp if you sign up for our services.
Email Receipts - When you use your credit card to place an order with MailChimp, you will naturally be receiving an email receipt for your purchase.
==========
Terminate your account - If you have not logged into MailChimp's system for 6 months, your account is considered "dormant."
To keep our system clean, we periodically send followup emails to dormant accounts with a link allowing them to permanently shut down their accounts.
System Alerts - All registered, active (non-dormant), MailChimp user accounts may receive mandatory "System Alert" messages which usually consist of: planned outages, system improvements (that may directly affect your account), version updates, point releases, abuse warnings, and important customer service information.
Our "System Alert" messages are brief and non-promotional in nature.
We promise to keep them as boring as possible.
==========
Free trial reminders - If you sign up for a free trial, but never activate your account or log in, we may send an automatic followup email within a few weeks (in case you never got your login instructions the first time).
Automated responses - If you submit a help ticket to MailChimp, our system might automatically send you a brief survey email, requesting your feedback on how your issue was resolved.
We use this information to improve our customer service.
Submitting a help ticket does not add you to any mailing list.
==========
D. Promotional Emails That We Send
We do not send promotional emails unless you have requested them.
From time to time, we send a "MailChimp News" email newsletter to registered users who affirmatively select the "opt-in" checkbox in their account settings for "Yes, send me MailChimp News."
We do not automatically send this newsletter to all users.
If you opt-in, then later change your mind, there are 2 ways to opt-out: 1) Click the "unsubscribe link" that we include in every newsletter, or 2) Log in to MailChimp, and un-check the box.
==========
E. Personally Identifiable Information, and Our Use of Cookies
We do not share your personally identifiable information with any 3rd parties.
When you visit our website, we don't automatically collect any personally identifiable information about you.
The cookies we place do not personally identify visitors on our website, unless the visitor is a registered user of MailChimp.
We temporarily store session information, so that registered users do not have to login every time they visit the site.
We place temporary cookies on web pages so that we can see how visitors use our website, but they do not personally identify users (we use this information to improve our website experience)
We place a transparent tracking bug on certain web pages to track the performance of online ads placed on other websites.
The trackers do not personally identify any visitors to our website.
They simply tell us about the performance of our online advertising
We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.
When we send emails to our own registered MailChimp customers, we'll sometimes track who opened and who clicked.
We do this to measure the performance of our email campaigns, and to improve our offerings to specific customer segments.
MailChimp customers: if your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update your account or deactivate it in the "Account Settings" area in MailChimp, or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information posted on this page.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
==========
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.
If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.
==========
We use other third parties to handle secure credit card transaction processing from our site.
When you make purchases on MailChimp, we send your billing information as necessary for the third party to process your order.
F. Collection and Distribution of Information in Aggregate Formats
We also collect information concerning non-personal email marketing stats from our customers' campaigns (such as open-rates, click-rates, bounce-rates, and ROI), and assemble reports that you, and other customers, can use to compare your performance against others in and/or outside your and their industries.
No personally identifiable information is provided with these reports.
Likewise, we reserve the right to collect and disclose any other information relating to the use of our website to any third party provided we do not disclose information in a form that can be linked to a particular customer.
G. Sale of Business
Notwithstanding any other term of this Privacy Policy, we may transfer your information in the event of the sale of substantially all of the assets of the business to a third-party or in the event of a merger, consolidation or acquisition.
However, in any such event, any acquirer will be subject to the provisions of our commitments to you set forth hereunder.
H. Safeguarding Your Information
To protect your information, our credit card processing vendor uses the latest 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for secure transactions.
In addition, our vendor is certified as compliant with card association security initiatives, such as the Visa Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP), MasterCardÂ® (SDP), and Discover Information Security and Compliance (DISC).
==========
MailChimp accounts require username and password to log in.
When you're finished using MailChimp, please click the "log out" link in the top right corner of your screen, to prevent someone from using your computer to access your account
Due to the sensitive nature of your recipient lists, we do not re-send forgotten passwords.
Users must follow online instructions to reset their passwords if they forget them.
Account passwords are encrypted from our own system admins.
We cannot see your passwords.
We can only reset them.
==========
I. Breach of Security Policy
Nobody is safe from hackers these days.
MailChimp will notify you as soon as possible if a breach in security results in an unauthorized intrusion into our system which directly or materially affects you or your subscribers, and will subsequently report the corrective action taken in response to the intrusion.
It should be noted however, that when you send a campaign, it bounces around the Internet from server to server, and can theoretically be read by prying eyes and nosy techies and government officials.
We have no control over the security and privacy of your emails and subscribers after you hit the "Send" button from MailChimp.
So if you're sending extremely private information to your recipients, and require absolute secrecy, email is not the way to go.
J. Children under 13
We do not knowingly provide accounts, or market to, or solicit information from, children under the age of 13.
==========
Our terms stipulate you must be 18 years or older to use the MailChimp system.
