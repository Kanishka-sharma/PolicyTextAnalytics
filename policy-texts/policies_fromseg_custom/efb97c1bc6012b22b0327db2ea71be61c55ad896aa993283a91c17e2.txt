Privacy Information  for Ancestry.com

			  Ancestry.com Operations Inc., (and referred to as 'Ancestry.com' 'Ancestry' 'we' 'us' 'our'), operator of this Website, recognizes the confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members in registering or making purchases from our Website and we are committed to protecting your privacy.
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Website.
The specifics  of our use of personal information are best described in the answers to the  following Frequently Asked Questions: 

Do you  ask for personal information from your members?
Yes.
==========
We ask for your name, e-mail address, and other limited personal information
				when you sign up as a member, when you use features such as e-mail, and when
				you make purchases from us.
We may ask for similar information at other times,
				such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by us and/or
				one of our partners.
To facilitate payment and fulfillment in connection with
				membership and other purchases from us, we will request personal credit card,
				debit card or other payment information.
==========
As a member of Ancestry.com, you can also chose to share further information 
				about yourself, your activity on the site, and your background and interests, 
				with other members of the site.
The type and quantity of profile information you 
				share in this way is entirely your choice.
Information about some of your activity 
				on the site, such as historical records you save, may also be shared with other 
				members in order to help you connect with others researching similar ancestors.
See "Member Profiles" below for more 
				information on how to edit and control what you allow other members to see about 
				you and your site activity in your public profile or other places on the site.
==========
How do  you use my personal information?
The primary use of your personal information, other than directly in connection  with a purchase, is to efficiently provide you with personalized, relevant  information.
We will also  use registration information to let you know about new features or other offers  of interest from us and to address customer service needs and requests.
==========
In distributing  advertiser or sponsor messages, the advertiser is not given access to  individual account information.
We do not sell, rent or otherwise distribute  the personal information you provide us to these advertisers for their use.
Advertisers simply provide the advertising message and we then display the ad  to appropriate users.
==========
Will  you disclose any of my personal information to third parties?
We will not disclose your personal information provided in connection with  membership registration or purchases, except as described in this Privacy  Statement or as may be required by law, or to protect our rights or property.
Information  submitted by you online (such as information about products you purchase from  us, your name, address, e-mail address) may be shared with companies with which  we have a commercial relationship and through which you reached Ancestry.com,  for marketing purposes.
For example, if you make a purchase with us because of a  special offer made through another Website acting as a distributor of our  products, in that circumstance you will be considered their customer as well.
We will not, except as may be required by law, share with any other party your  password or payment information.
Other  circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are  specifically described when the data is collected, or in the rules of  sweepstakes or other promotions.
==========
We do reserve  the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45 percent of  our users are female" or "10,000 members indicate an interest in  gardening" in order to describe our services to prospective partners,  advertisers, and other third parties.
Under  protection of confidentiality agreements, we use third party processors in some  cases to help us provide services and manage our Websites and relationships  with you.
These may include purchase and order fulfillment, credit card  processing, removing duplicate information from lists, providing marketing  assistance and providing other customer services.
Third-party processors and  providers will be given access only to that information needed to perform their  support functions, and are prohibited from using it for other purposes.
==========
As our business  continues to grow, we might buy or sell subsidiaries or business units.
In  these transactions, customer information is often one of the transferred  assets, remaining subject to promises made in existing privacy statements.
Also, in the event that Ancestry, or substantially all of  its assets are acquired, customer information will, as a matter of course, be  one of the transferred assets.
==========
What  about purchases from advertisers or other linked Websites?
If you click away from Ancestry.com to visit the Website of any third party  advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal  information in order to purchase or use products and services offered.
These  companies have their own privacy and data collection practices.
We have no responsibility  or liability for these independent policies.
You should therefore review their  privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may  be used.
==========
Will  you use my information for direct mailings?
We will send electronic mail or other mail to you, for the purpose of informing 
				you of changes or additions to Ancestry.com, or of any Ancestry.com or Ancestry related products and services.
If you do not want to 
				receive such mailings, you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link 
				listed in the e-mail or by amending your "newsletter and email preferences" in 
				the "My Account" section of the site.
==========
May I  refuse to provide personal information to you or to accept advertising?
Visitors may access Ancestry.com’s free services by providing a first name, last name, and e-mail address or other information that we may deem appropriate to that purpose.
To gain full access to the members-only areas, a username, e-mail address and appropriate billing information are required.
Because the Ancestry.com Website is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising that appears on Ancestry.com pages, but you may opt to be excluded from any e-mail advertising.
==========
Do you use "IP Addresses" and cookies?
IP Addresses:
              We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to  administer our Website.
Your IP address is also used to gather broad  demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members and may  be used to “geolocate” our members to allow us to provide services appropriate  to your place of residence.
==========
Cookies:
              Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information  you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the Website.
Cookies are tiny files  placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Website  that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each  time you return.
We may make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific  to your interests.
For instance, we may use cookies to retain your personal  preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or  save your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.
You can delete or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your browser 
				help function should tell you how to do this), but certain Ancestry services may 
				not work correctly or at all if you delete and/or block cookies.
==========
Advertiser  Cookies:
             We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.
These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.
Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.
If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here.
==========
Ancestry.com uses various vendors to serve targeted advertising.
If you wish to opt-out from these vendors, click here.
Ancestry.com uses the Better Advertising assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (http://www.aboutads.info).
As part of this service, Ancestry.com online advertisements are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options for consumers that want more control.
==========
When do  you distribute or publish information on the living on your Websites?
Posts contributed by our members to message boards and other community areas  may include information on the living.
While we advise our members to be  sensitive to privacy issues, we have no control over the content of these  posts.
If such a post violates our Terms and Conditions, you may notify us at "report abuse" and we will help  work toward resolving the issue.
==========
We do republish  databases that contain published information on the living, such as white  pages, people finder directories and some birth, death and marriage records.
The information in these databases has been gathered from public records  released by governmental and other agencies, and is available elsewhere, often  on the Internet.
What  else should I know about privacy?
==========
The following details a few key issues mentioned in context above: 

Member Profiles
			    When you sign up as a member, you are provided with a public member profile 
				pre-populated with your chosen user name and, as you use the site, with other 
				information.
Your user name and location will be displayed on the site when you 
				post, comment, or interact with the Ancestry community.
If you want additional 
				privacy, you can edit your user name within your public profile to one that does 
				not include any personally identifiable information.
You can also enhance your 
				public profile to provide additional information about yourself.
Any information 
				including sensitive information disclosed in this area becomes public and you 
				should therefore exercise caution when deciding what you chose to disclose.
Through the "Community Preferences" link in the Ancestry "My Account" section of 
				the site, you can chose either to display your email address to other members or 
				ensure that your email address is withheld so that you are only contacted 
				anonymously through the Ancestry Connection Service.
You can also control when 
				you are contacted or block certain people from contacting you.
==========
You can also customize what other members can learn about your Ancestry site activity.
To help you connect with other members researching similar ancestors, by default new accounts are set up to allow other members to learn about things you publicly add or post to the site, as well as some personal research activities (such as saving historical records to your Shoebox or private member tree).
To customize these settings, simply go to the “Activity Preferences” link on the Community Preferences page.
To make other changes to your public profile, go to the "My Public Profile" or 
				"My Site Preferences" section of the site.
==========
Additional Services
              If you purchase additional services from us, such as DNA testing, additional policies may apply regarding how we maintain and use that information and your rights to control that information.
Contests & Promotions
              We may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our Website in  which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail  address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level).
We  use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our  partners.
The participant’s contact information is also used to contact him or  her when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional  purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and  conditions specified when you take part in the promotion.
At any time, you may  opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part  in the promotions.
