In addition to personal information you provide directly to us, we may collect other information about you, including acquiring and using services provided by third parties who collect and analyze customer data.
We collect information in a variety of ways, including:
Through your browser or device: Certain information is collected by internet browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, device identifier, language, and Internet browser type and version.
We may also collect your IP address, along with the time of your visit and the page(s) visited.
Through your use of our mobile apps: When you download and use one of our mobile apps, we may collect and/or track app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to or presented through the app.
Using cookies, pixel tags, device profiling, and similar technologies: We may use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies to collect browser, device and other information, such as time spent on the Site, pages visited, language preferences, and other traffic data.
These cookies may contain or reflect segment or other interest-based data in a de-identified form including interests across other sites.
We may also collect various attributes associated with your device (such as IP address, installed fonts, language and browser settings, and time zone) in order to create a device fingerprint or identifier so that we can recognize your device.
Other similar tracking technologies may be introduced and used by us in the future in connection with the Site.
==========
Physical location when using your mobile device: We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or wireless local area network signals, as well as through the use of beacons in our branches.
We may also use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content, as well as to understand traffic patterns in and around our branches.
In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, but, if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
==========
We will collect your precise physical location only with your consent.
Please note that if you enroll in certain branch related services, such as cardless entry and in- branch navigation services, the Citi Mobile App may collect your precise location through the use of beacons, whether or not you are using the app.
We may also collect your precise physical location in order to provide you insights and facilitate goals regarding your spending activities.
You can de-enroll in these services at any time.
==========
You can choose whether to accept cookies through your browser settings.
For example, most browsers allow you to automatically decline cookies or decline or accept a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site when browsing.
If you decide not to accept cookies, some features of the Site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize your device and associate you with your Citi account(s).
In addition, the offers or content we provide when you visit our site or on third party sites may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
==========
Local Shared Objects, sometimes referred to as flash cookies may be stored on your hard drive using a media player or other software installed on your device.
Local Shared Objects are similar to cookies in terms of their operation, but may not be managed in your browser in the same way.
Restricting acceptance of Local Shared objects may impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with the Site including animation and video presentations.
For more information on managing Local Shared Objects, click here.
Similarly, certain authentication features of our mobile apps may set a persistent token, similar to a cookie, on your mobile device.
This token allows that device to be uniquely associated or bound with your account.
This token will remain on your device until you un-enroll from those features or delete the app from your device.
==========
In some instances, we may combine other information with personal information where permissible by law and applicable industry guidelines.
Citi, as well as others, offers account aggregation services that allow you to consolidate your electronically enabled financial account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view all your account information in one online location.
When acting as an account aggregator, Citi or its aggregation service provider may request your account user credentials for third-party (non-Citi) financial accounts, including usernames and passwords, in order to access your account information as your agent.
If you provide us access, as your agent, to your third-party account information we may use such information as well as your Citi account information where applicable, to provide you offers, suggestions and insights on your spending, savings and other financial behaviors.
These insights are not investment, tax or legal advice and neither Citibank not any of its affiliates are acting as a tax, legal or investment advisor in providing same.
With your consent, subject to written agreement, Citigroup Personal Wealth Management or other Citigroup businesses may currently or in the future provide investment advisory or other investment services based on online access to your investment account and other financial information.
==========
You may cancel enrollment in Citi's aggregation service or delete accounts at any time.
Upon cancellation or deletion of an account, we will delete and direct our third party service provider to delete this data from our and their respective records as permitted under applicable law, rules and regulations.
With regard to aggregation services provided by a third-party, if you provide your user credentials or other information about your Citi accounts to a third-party aggregation services provider, we will consider that you have authorized all transactions or actions initiated by such access information you provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction or action.
If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to an aggregation website, we strongly recommend that you change your password for Citi Online to ensure that the aggregation website cannot continue to access your account information.
We may, directly or through third parties, serve ads regarding products and services intended to be of interest to you on the Site and on third party sites or apps.
==========
We and others may use the online technologies described in Section 5 above to make inferences and predictions about your characteristics, interests and preferences based on your online interests and activities across other sites.
We may also use technologies to associate and recognize your various mobile and desktop devices in order to deliver ads and other content in a consistent manner across the devices you use.
Information we collect using the technologies described above may also be associated or linked with personal information, such as email or postal address, you provided directly to us or others.
Alternatively, personal information may also be linked with characteristics or attributes about you, such as lifestyle interests, in support of our marketing efforts.
==========
We may use, or share with others (in anonymous or non-readable form where appropriate) your information in order to better recognize you when visiting the Site and to provide relevant advertising (for Citi or third party's products/services), based on your interests, on the Site, on other sites and apps and other channels including television, email and direct mail.

At this time, we do not respond to browser do not track signals.
==========
The security of personal information about you is a priority.
We seek to protect this information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information within our organization.
We provide employee training in the proper handling of personal information.
When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of personal information they receive from us.
Although we take extensive measures to protect your personal information, and to anticipate and mitigate new threats to personal information, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
