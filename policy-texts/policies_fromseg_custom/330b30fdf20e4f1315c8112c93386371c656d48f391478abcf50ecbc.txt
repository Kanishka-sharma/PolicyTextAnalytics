How We Collect and Use Your Personally Identifying Information
Watchdog Complaints 
We encourage you to use TRUSTe's Watchdog Dispute Resolution process to report and resolve privacy complaints you may have concerning TRUSTe Sealholders or to report misuse of TRUSTe trademarks.
If you choose to file a Watchdog complaint, we collect your name, email, and location.
We also request you provide the details around your complaint.
==========
Any additional personally identifying information you provide on the Watchdog Complaint Form is optional.
We will use this information to investigate your complaint and to send you an optional Watchdog Customer Satisfaction Survey once your complaint is resolved.
We will not share your name or contact information with the TRUSTe Sealholder that is the subject of your privacy complaint unless you give us permission to do so.
Please be aware, however, that if we cannot share this information, then we may not be able to resolve your complaint.

We also use this information to provide you with customer support and to communicate regularly with you.
While providing you with customer support (including through the live chat feature on our website) we may also gather additional information from you.
From time to time we will also offer you the opportunity to receive information about privacy-related products or services offered by our third-party partners.

These reports will not identify individual TRUSTe Sealholders.

How We Share Your Personally Identifying Information

These third parties are authorized to use your personally identifying information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

 as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process 
 when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a written government request
 if TRUSTe becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personally identifying information becomes subject to a different privacy statement  
 to any other third party with your prior consent to do so 

We will share your personally identifying information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Statement.

TRUSTe will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you reasonable access to any of your personally identifying information we maintain within 30 days of your access request.
We provide this access so you can review it, make corrections or request deletion of your data.
If we cannot honor your request within the 30-day period, we will tell you when we will provide access.
In the unlikely event that we cannot provide you access to this information, we will explain why we cannot do so.

Security
Providing security for the personally identifying information you submit via our Site is a priority for TRUSTe.
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to; or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction; of your personally identifying information.
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt the transmission of data on the TRUSTe Sealholder application, payment and login pages.
Please be aware, however, that no transmission of information via the Internet can be entirely secure.

You should, therefore, always use caution when submitting personally identifying information online.
