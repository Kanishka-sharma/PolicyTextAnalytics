Terms of Service
1.
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Welcome to Pyra's BlogSpot.
Pyra.com Ltd. ("Pyra") provides the BlogSpot service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you; provided that, we will not alter Section 5 ("Content Submitted to BlogSpot") without prior notice to and acceptance by you.
You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: http://www.blogspot.com/tos.html.
Please note that other Pyra services (like Blogger) are governed by a different Terms of Service.

==========
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
BlogSpot currently provides users with access to web page hosting services, specifically for Blogger-powered web pages (the "Service").
(Blogger is a separate service of Pyra which does not require BlogSpot.
BlogSpot is provided simply as a convenience for Blogger users who don't already have a place to put the Blogger-powered site.)
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, shall be subject to this TOS.
Now, this next part seems really damn obvious, but everyone else has it in their TOS's so someone's probably gotten sued for not having it.
==========
So: In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access.
In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device.

Pyra will also not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a Member's information unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Pyra; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Pyra; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Pyra service's users or the public; (4) fix or debug problems with the BlogSpot servers/software/service.
