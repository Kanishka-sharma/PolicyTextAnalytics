MSN may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you.
In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.
Certain MSN services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company.
If you register for or use such services, both MSN and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
==========
In such cases, either a joint privacy statement or a link to the other company's privacy statement will be provided, which will provide you with information about how the other company will use the information and how you can contact the other company with requests to access the information or other inquiries.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services.
We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service.
They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information
MSN offers a special MSN Kids area that is specifically designed for children at http://kids.msn.com/.
MSN Kids has a special privacy statement that informs children and parents about the MSN Kids area, describes the additional privacy protections provided in this area, and provides children with tips on how to protect themselves online.
The rest of MSN is intended for users of all ages.
Children may visit these general audience areas of MSN and provide personal information, which will be collected, used and disclosed as described is this Privacy Statement.
Some, but not all, MSN sites require users to provide age information.
For those users who visit such sites and identify themselves as under 13, MSN uses Kids Passport, a service of .
NET Passport, to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information as described in this Privacy Statement.
If MSN changes this Privacy Statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and MSN will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent.
To learn more about the Kids Passport service, please visit www.passport.net and read the .
NET Passport Kids Privacy Statement.
==========
Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use such general audience communication services as MSN Chat, MSN Groups, MSN Messenger, or MSN Hotmail, your child will be able to communicate with other users of all ages.
Before providing consent, please be aware that such services will give your child the ability to disclose personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail, phone numbers) on his or her own.
We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.
You and your child can visit MSN's Stay Safe Online site for additional information about using the Internet safely.
==========
When an MSN service knows that a user is a child, it will not condition the child's participation in an activity, such as a game or a prize drawing, on the provision of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
Additionally, you have the right, subject to verification that you are the child's parent, to change or revoke the consent choices you have previously made for MSN services and to review or request the deletion of your child's personal information.
You may send such requests, or any questions you have about MSN's practices with regard to personal information about your child, by clicking here to send e-mail or by sending postal mail to the address in the "Contact Information" section of this Statement.
==========
Use of Cookies
MSN uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
For example, if you personalize MSN's pages, or register with MSN sites or services, a cookie helps MSN to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
When you return to MSN, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the MSN features that you customized.
==========
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the MSN services or Web sites you visit.
Use of Web Beacons
MSN Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow MSN to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.
==========
MSN may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or MSN Newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon.
Web beacons are not used to access your personal information on the MSN network of sites and services; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about MSN Web site usage.
Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.
MSN Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by third parties to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns.
Use of Third Party Ad Networks
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on MSN Web pages are displayed by MSN.
In addition, MSN allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on MSN Web pages.
==========
Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer.
Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.
In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.
==========
This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
Microsoft does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.
MSN maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating such as: 24/7 Real Media; AdForce; AdKnowledge; AppNet/admaximize/i33; Avenue A; BlueStreak.com; CFM&Z; Click Here; DoubleClick; Flycast; Interad Network; MatchLogic; Mediaplex; Sabela Media; The Thinking Media; and Vita Bella.
Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting.
You may find more information at the Web site of either the individual ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative.
==========
TRUSTe Certification
MSN is a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.
Because MSN wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.
Enforcement of this Privacy Statement
If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact MSN via e-mail.
If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html.

MSN Parental Controls
MSN Internet Software account managers can choose to set up MSN Parental Controls for the people who use that account.
The account manager is the person who subscribes to MSN.
==========
Because it is typically a parent enabling this feature for a child, the terms "parent" and "child" will be used to describe this feature.
E-mail notification: When a parent configures Parental Controls for a child, the child will receive an e-mail message describing the service and notifying him or her that Parental Controls have been set for the account.
Online activity report: Parents can choose to enable online reporting for a child who has Parental Controls set for his or her account.
If this feature is enabled, information about how a child uses the Internet will be stored temporarily on the child's computer.
This information is periodically sent to the parent by e-mail from the child's account and is then deleted from the child's computer.
==========
Contact lists: Parents may also choose to control the list of people that a child can correspond with using MSN Mail or MSN Messenger.
The list of contacts specified for the child is stored on MSN servers so that the child will be protected whenever and wherever he or she uses MSN Mail or Messenger.
The list of contacts can be edited by the parent or can be deleted by deleting the child's account.
Task requests: A child may request permission to complete a task that a parent has blocked.
For example, the child can request access to a blocked Web site or for the ability to exchange e-mail messages with a new friend.
==========
MSN stores this automated request for a brief period, allowing the parent to review, allow, or deny the request from any computer using MSN Internet Software.
MSN Customer Experience Improvement Program

If you choose to participate, you allow Microsoft to collect anonymous information about how you use Microsoft software and services, as well as some information about your computer.

The Customer Experience Improvement Program can be turned on or off at any time in MSN Explorer or MSN Internet Software on the Privacy settings page.

Your settings are not used by MSN for any purpose other than to provide you access to them.
==========
Automatically Suggested Tasks
When MSN Internet Software is used with Microsoft Windows XP, the MSN Address bar has additional advanced capabilities.
For example, if you type "search for a new car," the Address bar will automatically suggest Web sites that might help you locate a new car.
When the MSN Address bar automatically suggests a task, the following information is collected: the text of the original request, the suggestions offered by the Address bar, and which of those suggestions, if any, are selected.
==========
The information is collected by Microsoft for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding its usage.
