Effective Date: January 1st 2020  DoubleVerify, Inc. (“DoubleVerify”) is the industry leader in providing transparency and accountability in online advertising.
This Privacy Notice describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through the DoubleVerify products and services.
Our accredited technology platform provides an independent, third-party set of measurements about ad impression delivery and website traffic to help advertisers and advertising inventory sellers confirm accurate delivery characteristics, including brand safety, viewability metrics, contextual and environmental parameters (e.g., the website on which an ad appears, and where it appears on the webpage) and ad impression and website traffic quality characteristics, and to help ensure that advertisers and their partners are in compliance with their agreements, as applicable.
Additionally, advertisers use information we provide about ad impression opportunities to decide if they want their creative displayed in the available impression environment.
==========
DoubleVerify collects this data about advertising delivery and website traffic on behalf of both advertisers and sellers and shares the information we collect to drive transparency and accountability in the online advertising marketplace.
The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to inform you of: (1) the types of information DoubleVerify may gather about you or your device when an advertisement that is analyzed by us is delivered to you on a website you are viewing or in an app you are using; and (2) and how we may use, share, and otherwise process that information.
Data Collected by the DoubleVerify Services DoubleVerify does not collect, retain or share any personally identifiable information gathered on sites or apps not owned by Doubleverify.
This includes both unique user identifiers, as well as IP addresses, except for the limited purpose of fraud prevention and geo compliance and never to create user profiles in which case we collect and retain, but do not share, user IP for 45 days and never correlate a user IP across domains except when fraud is detected.
==========
DoubleVerify uses various technologies to collect information about online advertising, website traffic, mobile app traffic, and connected device traffic in order to deliver advertising transparency and accountability services to our advertising customers (collectively, “DoubleVerify Services”).
To deliver DoubleVerify Services, we use pixels and other similar technologies that can place a small piece of HTML code on a webpage to collect information about advertising impression opportunities and displayed ads or website traffic.
Types of data collected as part of DoubleVerify Services:  • Standard HTTP header information including information such as IP address, Referring URL, and User-Agent data (e.g., data that your browser transmits about itself when submitting an HTTP request).
==========
which are exclusively used for the limited purpose of fraud prevention and geo compliance and never to create user profiles.
• Information contained within an advertisement, known as an “Ad Tag,” that includes information used to identify the advertiser displaying the ad and the media property that sold the impression.
• Browser and computer environmental information necessary to determine the viewability of an advertisement, which includes information such as ad size, ad location in the browser viewport, size of the browser viewport, size of the display, application in focus, browser tab in focus, and other data.
• Mobile application, mobile device, and connected device data such as device identifiers, advertising IDs, application name, bundle IDs, application ID, store ID and other similar data.
For the purpose of identifying and preventing online ad impression fraud and invalid traffic and determining if advertisers and their partners are in compliance with their agreements, DoubleVerify Services utilize information collected in conjunction with the following additional technologies:  • Cookies that may be set by third party service providers executing a DoubleVerify pixel so that DoubleVerify can recognize the device.
• Device identification technology, which analyzes device parameters collected as described above, including IP address and browser header information, to probabilistically identify a particular device.
==========
• Clickstream data including URLs and other data regarding the websites on which a particular browser has viewed advertising impressions we are analyzing.
• Clickstream data including mobile and connected device application identifier and other data regarding the mobile and connected device apps on which a particular user has viewed advertising impressions.
• Webpage (HTML and Javascript) structure analysis.
==========
Use of Collected Data  We use the data we collect to provide DoubleVerify Services for any lawful purpose, including the following:  • Data reporting about the context in which advertisements are displayed and information about whether an ad being displayed is in compliance with: (1) the customer’s contractual terms; (2) the insertion order governing our customer’s campaign; and/or (3) profile settings our customer has established in our system.
• Preemptive decisioning of impression opportunities, meaning that DoubleVerify technology analyzes the available data characteristics of an impression opportunity and determines - using customer-established profile setting -- whether the customer’s advertisement should be displayed or not.
• To deliver information about the viewability of online display advertising, including: (1) whether an advertisement meets certain criteria, set by industry standards boards and/or the client to be counted as a “Viewed Impression;” (2) how long the advertisement was displayed in the consumer’s browser; and (3) other key information about the display characteristics of the creative on the consumer’s browser.
• We may work (with our partners) to anonymously integrate advertising impression data with data that our partners independently collect to deliver enhanced ad-measurement services such as augmented and aggregated audience demographic reporting of campaign impressions viewed or brand lift metrics.
• Website, mobile apps, and connected device visitation characteristics including visitor quality, invalid traffic detection, fraud identification and other quality characteristics necessary to determine agreement compliance.

o To protect the security of our interests, including our premises, assets, and systems.
o To comply with the law.
o As otherwise disclosed at the time personal information is collected.
==========
DoubleVerify Services include the detection and elimination of invalid traffic, including ad impression fraud, which is defined for purposes of this Privacy Notice as the manipulation of ad serving, ad display, or traffic activity such that ad impression measurements are incremented inappropriately because the ads cannot be viewed by a user, are not served within operationally viewable parameters or were displayed as a result of machine-generated traffic.
Our fraud and invalid traffic services are intended to address fraud for advertising measurement purposes.
DoubleVerify Services also include determining if advertisers and their partners are in compliance with their agreements.
==========
Information collected for this purpose are used to identify and prevent invalid traffic and ad impression fraud and assess contract compliance by:  • Identifying specific ad impressions that are fraudulent due to being generated by bot-controlled, non-human browsers.
• Identifying invalid traffic such as traffic generated by ad injectors, traffic originated in data centers, misrepresented traffic, emulated traffic and other types of invalid traffic.
• Identifying websites, mobile and connected device apps, and media properties that have fraudulent traffic and/or generate fraudulent advertising impressions.
• Identifying traffic patterns between websites participating in fraudulent advertising activity.
• Distinguishing between traffic generated by bot-controlled, non-human browsers and human browsers.
• Determining if website visitors, mobile app users, and connected device users are being delivered by partners in compliance with contractual terms.
Additionally, DoubleVerify uses advertising impression information, mobile app information, connected device information, and website traffic information including IP address and browser header information to:  • Identify the geographic location of the user and determine if the user is located within the advertiser’s campaign or traffic settings.
==========
• Determine if a middleware is attempting to misrepresent its operating characteristics to prevent the identification of fraud or other invalid traffic.
• Determine if website traffic or ad impressions are originating from a server farm unlikely to be responsible for human-generated browsing activity.
• Determine if traffic is being acquired through fraud, or regarding or other traffic acquisition practices that are out of compliance with an advertiser’s guidelines or contractual requirements.
==========
DoubleVerify is leveraging AI and machine learning in order to automate the process of detecting invalid traffic and fraudulent activity.
