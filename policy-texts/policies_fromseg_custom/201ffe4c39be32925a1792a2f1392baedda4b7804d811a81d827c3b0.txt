DoubleClick Privacy
Statement

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to DoubleClick, our advertisers and our Web publishers.
The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users.
Below is information regarding DoubleClick's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.
User Information
All users who receive an ad targeted by DoubleClick's technology remain completely anonymous to DoubleClick.
In the course of delivering an ad to you, DoubleClick does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address.
DoubleClick does, however, collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto or your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer).
The information collected by DoubleClick is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of DoubleClick's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it.
For additional information on the non-personally-identifiable information that is collected by DoubleClick, please click here.
==========
There are some cases when a user voluntarily provides personal information in response to an ad (a survey or purchase form, for example).
In these situations, DoubleClick (or a third party engaged by DoubleClick) collects the information on behalf of the advertiser and/or Web site.
This information is used by the advertiser and/or Web site so that you can receive the goods, services or information that you requested.
==========
Where indicated in some requests, DoubleClick may use this information in aggregate form to get a more precise profile of the type of individuals viewing ads or visiting the Web sites.
Cookies and Opt Out
DoubleClick, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience.
DoubleClick's cookies cannot be used to determine any personally-identifiable information about you and do not damage your system or files in any way.
Here's how it works.
==========
When you are first served an ad by DoubleClick, DoubleClick assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer.
Then, when you visit a Web site on which DoubleClick serves ads, DoubleClick reads this number to help target ads to you.
The cookie can help ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over again.
==========
Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site.
This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs.
While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising.
==========
If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature.
To find out more about this procedure, please click  here.
While some third parties offer programs to manually delete your cookies, DoubleClick goes one step further by offering you a "blank" or "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being stored.
If you would like more information on how to opt-out, please click here.
Disclosure
DoubleClick makes available all of our information practices at www.doubleclick.net, including in-depth descriptions of our targeting capabilities, this stance on privacy, and full disclosure on the use of cookies (above).
==========
In addition, we provide all users with the option to contact us at info@doubleclick.net with any further questions or concerns.
Honesty
DoubleClick has voluntarily opened its practices and systems for third party auditing.
We are committed to shaping privacy policies and standards with industry organizations and are active members of the Internet Advertising Bureau, Online Privacy Alliance, New York New Media Association, and the American Advertising Federation.
DoubleClick's policy on privacy is also in accordance with the Direct Marketing Association's Marketing Online Privacy Principles, which were agreed upon by the Interactive Services Association.
