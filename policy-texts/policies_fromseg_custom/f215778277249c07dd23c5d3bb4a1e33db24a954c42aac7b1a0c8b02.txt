Thank you for visiting http://seekingalpha.com (together with all other websites operated by Seeking Alpha, Ltd., the "Site").
Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Web Site.
This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use.
==========
Introduction

We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.
Currently, we do not require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on our Site.
If you would like to receive any email notifications or updates from us, please register to create a profile and provide your email address.
At a later time, you may add additional Personal Information to your profile.
==========
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Site, we may transfer that Personal Information within Seeking Alpha or to Seeking Alpha's third-party service providers, but only to provide services on the Site, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
Seeking Alpha strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy.
Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Seeking Alpha intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information.
In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter certain identifying information, should we in the future require such information, to gain access to certain parts of the Site.
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed.

Notice

We do not currently provide your Personal Information to third parties.
Nevertheless, we may at a later time choose to make certain offers or services available to our users from third parties.
If we do, during the registration process and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers we may ask you whether your Personal Information may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you.
==========
If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, your Personal Information (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to our Site) may be shared with data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other organizations.
Seeking Alpha does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Seeking Alpha's behalf unless such transfer is legally required.
Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your Personal Information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners.
This aggregate information does not contain any Personal Information that can identify an individual user.
==========
Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Seeking Alpha.

==========
Security

We have implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures to protect and safeguard the Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss.
