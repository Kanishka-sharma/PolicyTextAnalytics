Aggregate Data.
Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed.
For example, information about how you use a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data.
Lucid uses aggregate data to help optimize and develop our system.
General Technical User Data.
General technical user data, such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the date and time of your visit, may be automatically collected through the use of “cookies” (small files that are stored on your computer by a website to give you a unique identification).
==========
Cookies also keep track of services you have used, record registration information regarding your login name and password, ensure you do not repeatedly see survey questions, record your preferences and keep you logged into the Lucid Site.
Third Party Collected Data, Interest Based Advertising and Tracking.
We may use, and allow third parties to use, web beacons on the Lucid Site to monitor the effectiveness of survey qualification or for other legitimate purposes.
Web beacons are small, graphic images on web pages, web-based documents, or in email messages that allow us or third parties to monitor who is visiting the Lucid Site or if the email has been read.
Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed.
Web beacons may be linked to your personal information.
We may also use third-party devices, links or electronic mail, to deliver surveys to you.
These third-party surveys or devices may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Lucid Site (or other sites) in order to present surveys that may be of interest to you.
==========
We may collect traffic information and data on and from the use of third parties sites.
Lucid may use a pixel or cookie to examine what is happening on third-party websites, including programs and sites with marketing and advertising partners, to improve the understanding of site traffic at a granular level and market research effectiveness.
Respondents or participants in survey or survey panels that are hosted on, accessed by or routed through the Lucid Site should consult the privacy and other policies of third parties through whom they are providing information.
You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads and tracking from third parties who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.

Do Not Track.
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
These features are not yet uniform, and our website is not currently set up to respond to those signals for tracking on our website.
==========
Disclosure of Information
We do not sell, rent or share information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy.
We may share information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business.

Fulcrum does not share or collect personally identifiable information with other third-party organizations for their marketing, advertising or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

Respondents have generally provided their consent to participation in a particular survey or survey panel directly to those third parties collecting such information, and Lucid is not responsible for any information you provide to third parties directly or through our services in brokering or providing sample to Clients or Suppliers from third parties.
Lucid encourages Respondents to consult and become familiar with the privacy practices of third parties before disclosing information directly as a result of their becoming a Respondent.
In addition, information about our Clients or Suppliers or any Respondents may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of Lucid assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.
