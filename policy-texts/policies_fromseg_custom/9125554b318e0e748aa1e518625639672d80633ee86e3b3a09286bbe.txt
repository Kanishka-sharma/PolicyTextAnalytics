ABOUT SUNDAYSKY
SSKY is a pioneer in serving online video ads that are personalized to our customers’ customers.
The objective is to present personalized video ads to viewers that express interest in our customers’ websites, as visitors browse the web.
The rationale is that by doing that, the advertisements presented are more relevant to viewers.
One may see these ads when visiting other websites that publish online video ads.
SSKY strongly believes that this approach is beneficial for both our customers and their website visitors as each viewer is presented with the advertising message that will match his or her specific preferences.
By doing this, viewers get ads that are more interesting for them, so they are less likely to be annoyed by them and are, as we’ve seen, significantly more likely to engage with them in search for additional information or to take advantage of a specific offer.
