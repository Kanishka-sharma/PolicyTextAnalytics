If an e-mail message to CDC is sent or a questionnaire, form, or other online survey found on the CDC web site is completed, CDC will maintain the information in accordance with applicable federal law.
CDC does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any information about CDC web site visitors unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required by law.
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, CDC employs software programs to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Use of Cookies
CDC webpages use two types of "cookies" session-based and persistent.
The majority of cookies used are session-based.
These bits of information are stored temporarily in your computerâ€™s random access memory (RAM) as a line of text.
When you close your browser, the cookie is destroyed and no trace of it remains on your hard drive.
==========
These session cookies are used solely as a method to improve the user experience for those visiting the site.
In very few cases, the CDC web site uses persistent cookies to store information for a longer period.
In those cases, the webpage is clearly noted and the user can choose not to use that webpage feature.
As noted above, in no case does CDC disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information about CDC web site visitors unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required by law."
