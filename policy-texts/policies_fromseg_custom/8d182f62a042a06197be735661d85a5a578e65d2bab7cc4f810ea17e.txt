Rights of EU / EEA users 

EU / EEA citizens and residents have a number of rights with regard to their personal data, including the right to access their information.
For such EU / EEA users, in many cases where we process personal data, they may also have a right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use that personal data.
In certain circumstances – for example, where we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes or pursuant to our legitimate business interests – you also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data by us, and you can also request that we delete your personal data.
You also have a right to obtain a copy of your personal data in an easily accessible format, and in certain circumstances, you may also request us to transfer personal data about you to third parties.
==========
To the extent feasible, we will carry out these requests and we may ask you to verify your identity before doing so.
With respect to the personal data you provide to us on the plista web sites, you have the right to receive a copy of the personal data stored by plista and, if necessary, to correct, block or delete them.
You also have the right to withdraw your given consent regarding the use of your personal data in connection with our newsletter or email marketing.
You may withdraw by canceling your subscription or unsubscribing at any time.
With respect to our Services, because we do not retain and store any names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar data that would enable identification of a particular individual in association with a cookie ID or advertising ID, we are unable technically to offer the ability for you to change elements of the personal data about you.
If you believe any of the personal data elements about you is inaccurate, please note that you have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data at any time.
==========
If you have questions about any of these rights or wish to exercise these rights, please contact us at privacy@plista.com.
You should also contact us at that email alias if your personal data or preferences change, if you do not want us to send you the information you previously requested, or if you have any queries about how we use your personal data.
==========
Without limiting any other rights you may have, you also have the right to lodge a complaint against us with a supervisory authority in the EU Member State where you are based.
