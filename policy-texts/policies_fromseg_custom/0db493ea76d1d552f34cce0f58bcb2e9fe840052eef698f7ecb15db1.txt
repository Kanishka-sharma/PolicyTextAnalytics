Internet “Cookies”
Cookies are small amounts of data that a website offers to your browser in order to remember your preferences, identification, shopping cart entries, etc. from one request to the next.
These may be persistent cookies that your browser stores for days or weeks, or temporary, session, cookies that a site uses to store “shopping cart” and other governing visitors’ use of the site.
Cookies may be delivered by the web page, via a visible image or content frame on a page, or using small strings of invisible code placed into the web page for this purpose, and known as web beacons, clear GIFs, or pixel tags.
==========
Your browser is built to only return cookie information to the same website (domain) that issued it.
Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, etc.
The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
==========
Transparency: Trueffect Advertising Technology
Trueffect serves primarily as the technology behind high-volume interactive advertising.
Our customers use our platform to serve numerous “banner” ad campaigns across many online properties each day.
Our platform collects or gives advertisers reporting and targeting access to the following types of data:
Geographic Segments: Country, State, ZIP Code, etc. (inferred using IP address)
Technographic Segments: Operating System, Browser Version, Domain, etc.
Circumstantial Segments: Time of Day, Web Page, Keyword Search Terms, etc.
==========
Details within a cookie that has been previously issued by an advertiser may also reveal an existing relationship between the visitor and the advertiser, which the advertiser may use to reengage the consumer with appropriate messaging rather than random ads.
Cookies and Online Ad Serving
We use the data that we collect using cookies for the following purposes:
To better understand overall web surfing behavior and trends
To anonymously assess the numbers of unique visitors encountered
To prevent excessive display of the same ads to any single visitor
To refine ad targeting and drive more relevant advertising when appropriate
For reporting purposes
Sensitive Data and Personally-Identifiable and Information
Except for the specific business-to-business marketing activities indicated under Privacy and This Website, we do not gather or manage personally-identifiable information, collect or process inbound leads or store other personally-identifiable information.
Children’s data, financial account numbers, Social Security numbers and data related to visitor health-related conditions or medical records are all inappropriate for ad targeting and not used by Trueffect.
==========
We rigorously educate our customers on these principles and require their compliance as well.
Data Accountability
Trueffect implements reasonable security measures to protect both personal and non-personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Our employees are made aware of and are accountable for compliance with these procedures.
==========
Data Security: Processing and Retention
Trueffect performs long-term trending and analysis for our customers, and may retain ad transaction data for this purpose, including anonymous identifiers and IP address information, for up to eighteen months.
This archival data is not used for online behavioral advertising or ad targeting, and is programmatically deleted within 31 days of concluding its eighteen-month lifespan.
==========
Consumer Control: Cookies and Opt-Out
Each Trueffect client has a standard set of opt-out controls that can prevent interest-based targeting of ads:
Single domains use a mechanism like Trueffect’s AdLegend.com domain opt-out
Trueffect clients who use our platform to power network advertising (use of a common domain to support advertising on multiple sites) participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out, available here
Activating either of these mechanisms will set a persistent cookie on your browser that instructs systems not to gather data or to influence ads that you see.
This opt-out cookie must remain in place to identify your preference, and targeted advertising may resume if it is deleted (such by clearing all cookies, etc.).
==========
Do-Not-Track Compliance
Though it remains an emerging capability, Trueffect has been a pioneer in support of Do-Not-Track technology, and was among the very earliest ad serving systems to support it.
All Trueffect ad systems will respond properly when compliant browsers present requests accompanied by the ‘DNT=1′ header:
Any existing visitor ID is deleted
No new identifier is issued
The request is otherwise treated as if our standard ‘opt-out’ cookie is present
This behavior is fundamental to our platform and cannot be overridden by us or our clients.
==========
We continue to work closely with industry organizations to give consumers choice and individual control.
This website (Trueffect.com) serves primarily as our interface with our market and customers, and we use it to showcase best practices in privacy and data security:

We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.
==========
The majority of our customers deploy our technology within their own domain, allowing them serve ads within the terms and conditions of their existing privacy policies and practices.
Unlike other technologies, TruEffect’s patented first-party ad serving allows them to do this without revealing either personal or non-personal data to any third party.
Our customers use their own cookies for this purpose, and must adhere to Trueffect privacy policies and industry best practices.
==========
Because of the inherent privacy and security of first-party ad serving, it can only be managed by the advertiser with whom you have a relationship.
All of our first-party ad serving clients maintain their own privacy policies and govern the necessary opt-out mechanisms for their own secure, closed advertising networks.
While this privacy policy will always be clearly posted, up-to-date, and compliant with current best practices, we may amend it from time to time as standards and practices within the industry evolve, or as we add new products and services, or update our product offerings.
Consumers are notified before any changes to PII management or opt-in programs are implemented.
==========
If all or part of the company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, previously volunteered customer and prospect information may be transferred as well, along with the conditions and requirements under which it was originally collected and managed.
