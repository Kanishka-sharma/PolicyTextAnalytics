Use of your information by other companies
We share user information with other companies for various reasons.
What information we make available to other companies depends on the nature of our relationships with them.
We generally require these other companies to keep our users' information confidential.
Service Providers: We may share all of the types of information we collect with vendors who provide services (such as voice transcription, email and SMS messaging, and payment processing), conduct surveys, and run sweepstakes on our behalf.
Advertisers: Advertisers and advertising networks use tracking technologies to collect information about users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities (for example, web pages visited and searches made) as well as general geographic location and use that information to display targeted ads to users.
We sometimes allow these ad companies to collect such information when you use our sites and apps to enable them to display targeted ads to you.
Analytics Companies: We allow analytics companies to use tracking technologies to collect information about our users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities.
These companies analyze this information to help us understand how our sites and apps are being used.

Tracking technologies
We, as well as other companies, use tracking technologies to collect and store data about your computer or mobile device and your activities on our sites and apps.
Cookies: When you visit our sites, we place "cookies" (small text files) on your computer to recognize you.
We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our sites.
Ad companies place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display targeted ads.
Some ad companies and game developers use "flash cookies" for ads and games that use Flash media technology.
Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative.
==========
NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies.
To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/ and click on the "Consumer Opt-out" button.
Companies may also be members of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and to opt out of cookie tracking by DAA members, you may visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
Finally, to learn how to remove cookies, you may visit these links: deleting cookies and deleting flash cookies.
By using our site and products, you give us explicit consent to place cookies and other tracking technology on your computer or mobile device.
==========
Pixel tags: We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails.
These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed).
We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services.
Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).
==========
Mobile Device IDs: If you're using an app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you.
We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our apps.
Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted.
Ad companies use device IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you.
Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.
Do Not Track Disclosure
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI “Consumer Opt-out” link and the DAA opt-out link above.
However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
