Our Site may use various software technologies including “cookies,” “web beacons” and “pixel tags.”
“Cookies” are small text files that we and others may place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences.

"Web beacons" or “Pixel tags” are small pieces of code placed on a web page or within the body of an email to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page or viewing or opening an email.
For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.
We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this and advertising purposes.

Certain third party ad networks may automatically collect information about your visits to our Sites and other websites, such as your IP address, your Internet service provider, and the browser you use to visit our Sites.
They do this using cookies, web beacons or other technologies.
