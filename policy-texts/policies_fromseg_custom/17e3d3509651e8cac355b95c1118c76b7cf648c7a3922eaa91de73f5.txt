We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful.
Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.
==========
Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit.
This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.
==========
If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising.
If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising.
==========
In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.
Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill.
These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.
