This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information through our web site.
"Personal Information" means information that would allow a party to contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.
Submitted Information.
We collect Personal Information about you when you submit information or requests to us (through this website or otherwise).
We use your submitted information to send you emails that you have requested, and for administrative purposes (such as to notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy).
In emails we send you, we generally provide a method to unsubscribe from future emails.
Note, however, that when you submit your email address as part of our licensing application, we use this address for no purpose other than to email you the RDF, html, and the Uniform Resource Locator that corresponds to the license you selected.
Your email address is expunged from our logs after this email has been successfully sent.
Browsing Information.
When you use the Creative Commons site, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your "IP address") about your activities while visiting the site, including the web pages you view and the times you view them and information about the browser you are using.
We do not link browsing information to the Personal Information you submit to us; we use this browsing information for internal purposes such as to help understand how the site is being used and to improve it, and for systems administration purposes.
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.
==========
Disclosure of Personal Information.
Although we may disclose aggregated information about the use of our site, that information does not contain Personal Information.
Generally, we do not disclose Personal Information to third parties.
However, we may share Personal Information with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the site.
==========
If Creative Commons becomes part of another organization, that organization will possess the Personal Information collected by Creative Commons and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We cannot ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties.
For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
Security.
Creative Commons has implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information.
However, no internet site can fully eliminate security risks.

We may amend this policy at any time by sending the amended policy to the email address you provided to us or by posting the amended policy on our site.
