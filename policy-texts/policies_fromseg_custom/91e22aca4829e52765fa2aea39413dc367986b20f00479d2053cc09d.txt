ONLINE TRACKING
When you use our Services, we and our third party partners (which provide content, advertising, functionality, measurements, or analytics for our Services) may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to track your use of the Services.
What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are stored in your device’s browser when you visit a website.
Cookies make it possible to recognize you as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more websites.
We and third parties use cookies for a variety of purposes, including remembering your sign-in credentials and preferences so that you do not have to input them each time you use the Services; allowing us and third parties to customize your experience using the Services, including by determining the most relevant content and advertisements to show you on our websites and elsewhere online; and allowing us and third parties to monitor site traffic and performance, so that we may improve our Services and your experience.
What are Beacons?
==========
Web beacons (also called “web tags” or “pixels”) are tiny graphics or scripts that communicate information from your device to a server.
Beacons can be embedded in online or mobile content, videos, advertisements, or emails.
They allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, such as when you viewed the beacon (and thus the content in which it is embedded) and the IP address of the device on which you viewed the beacon.
We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
THIRD PARTIES
We rely on third parties to provide many features of our Services using data about your use of our Services and of other websites.
==========
These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to collect and process your personal data for the purposes of information storage and access; personalization of our Services; measurement of and analytics regarding the use of our Services; content selection, delivery, and reporting; and advertising selection, targeting, delivery, and reporting.
For instance, third party analytics services use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website, in order to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’ activity, and provide other data and insights related to the Services’ usage.
We also allow our third party partners, third party ad serving networks, and unaffiliated advertisers (collectively, “Advertisers”) to use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to provide ads about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
Advertisers may place a separate cookie on your computer, mobile device, or browser, or utilize other data collection and tracking technologies, to collect information such as your IP address, browser type, server being used, area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you respond to particular ads.
Advertisers may collect information about your online activities over time, across different computers, devices, and browsers, and across different websites and other online services.
==========
Advertisers may use this information to provide interest-based advertising or other targeted content.
We may not have access to these cookies, although we may use statistical information arising from the cookies provided by these third parties to customize content and for the other purposes described above.
Advertisers may also transfer this information to other parties where required to do so by law, or where such other parties process the information on their behalf.
==========
We will not provide Advertisers with access to your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number without your consent.
Advertisers may use persistent identifiers, however, to track your internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond our Services.
Though we restrict any attempts to re-identify this information, Advertisers may nonetheless be able to do so by combining information they collect about you when you use the Services with information about you obtained from other sources.
==========
In general, the information collected and generated by third parties is processed and stored by the third parties and will be subject to their respective privacy policies (which we do not control and for which we are not responsible).
We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or the information they may collect.
Below is a list of the third party data processing partners with which we have a direct relationship, grouped by the type of data processing they provide to us and linked to their respective privacy policies (which may provide more information about their use of your data and how to exercise your rights to opt-out of that usage).
Please note that this list does not include advertisers (with whom we have no direct relationship) who advertise on our websites through ad serving networks.
This list was last updated on May 28, 2018; because our Services are under constant development, it may be modified and updated on an ongoing basis.

Many of the third party advertisers that use tracking or targeting tools in connection with our Services either directly, or are members of programs that, offer you additional choices regarding the collection and use of your information.
You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting their websites:

About Facebook Ads and Facebook Privacy Policy
The Services may deliver advertising using the vendor DoubleClick, a Google company.
You can read about how DoubleClick uses cookies, use Google’s controls for blocking certain ads, or use Google’s Ad Settings Page to control how DoubleClick personalizes your ad experience.
The Services may use Google Analytics to track your usage.

Android: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/
Windows: http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out

It will exclude you, however, from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.
==========

USERS IN THE EEA AND SWITZERLAND
If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland (an “EEA User”), the following information applies with respect to personal data collected through your use of our Services.
Purposes of processing and legal basis for processing:
We process personal data consistent with our disclosures in this Privacy Policy.
We process personal data on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide Services (such as when you subscribe to a newsletter); and (3) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing the Services where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms related to data privacy.
All EEA Users of qz.com (including quartzy.qz.com, work.qz.com, and any other qz.com domain or sub-domain) (the “Site”) will see a personal data processing disclosure and consent interface (a persistent banner at the bottom of the screen).
==========

Visitors preferring to use the Site without personalized advertising should toggle “Personalize ads” to “Off” at the top of this Policy.
For any EEA User who toggles “Personalize ads” to “Off,” Quartz will only serve non-personalized and non-programmatic advertising, which may be targeted using coarse location.
An EEA User may manage her data usage preferences at any time by clicking “Manage Preferences” on our consent interface or by returning to this Privacy Policy (and updating the “Personalize ads” setting at the top of the Policy).

==========
Transfers:
Personal data we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or processors maintain facilities.
We will ensure that transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization are subject to appropriate safeguards.
Our Privacy Shield Policy governs use of personal information that has been transferred to us from organizations in the EEA and Switzerland.
Your Rights:
You are entitled to the rights under Chapter III of the EU General Data Protection Regulation or Section 2 of the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection with respect to the processing of your personal data, which include the right to access and rectify and to request erasure of personal data.
To exercise these rights, contact Privacy(at)QZ(dot)com and provide as complete a description of your request as possible.
==========
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
How Your Information Is Secured.
We take reasonable security measures to protect your information, including the use of physical, technical and administrative controls.
Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
You need to help protect the privacy of your own information.
You must take precautions to protect the security of any personal information that you may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless (WiFi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your personal information.
You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks.
==========
How Long Your Information Is Stored.
The time period for which we keep information varies according to the purpose for which it is used for.
In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period.
Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
==========
Emails and Newsletters.
You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail marketing messages and newsletters from Quartz by following the instructions contained within the emails and newsletters, or by e-mailing, calling or writing us at the addresses in the “Questions” section of the Privacy Policy below.
Contests, Sweepstakes or Games.
When we run a contest, sweepstakes, or game relating to the Services, it will be accompanied by a set of rules.
The rules for each contest, sweepstakes or game will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed if it is different than as described in this privacy policy.
In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it.
==========
Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.
When you purchase a subscription to one of our products (including Quartz Membership and Quartz Private Key), we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (a “Payment Service”).
Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.
Quartz does not itself receive (or collect, process, or store) any payment card industry (“PCI”) data.
==========
Children’s Information.

If Quartz discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Quartz with personal information and we do not have parental consent, Quartz will immediately delete that child’s information.
If you believe that company has been provided with the personal information of a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please notify us immediately at Privacy(at)QZ(dot)com.
