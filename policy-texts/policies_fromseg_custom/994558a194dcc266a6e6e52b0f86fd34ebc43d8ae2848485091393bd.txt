Transactions and e-commerce on our site.
During your visit to our site you may elect to engage in a transaction involving the purchase of a product such as a newspaper subscription, a print or online advertisement or other tangible goods and services.
To serve you most efficiently, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third party processing agent, bank or distribution institution.
==========
While in most cases transactions are completed without difficulty, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet or offline.
If you're concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call us and place your order by phone.
Chicagotribune.com cannot take responsibility for the success or security of transactions undertaken or processed by third parties.
==========
On occasion, a product or service may not be available at the time or the price as it appears in an advertisement.
