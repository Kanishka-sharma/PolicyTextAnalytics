Texts and Translations - DeepL Translator (free version)
When using our translation service, please only enter texts that you wish to transfer to our servers.
The transmission of these texts is necessary in order for us to provide the translation and offer you our service.
We process your texts, the documents you upload and their translations for a limited period of time to train and improve our neural networks and translation algorithms.
==========
This also applies to corrections you make to our translation suggestions.
The corrections are forwarded to our servers to check them for accuracy and, if necessary, to update the translated text according to your changes.
==========
If you use the glossary feature and enter certain pairs of terms there, this data is only stored locally and is not forwarded to our servers.
Therefore, you cannot use your glossary entries in another browser or on another device.
==========
Please note that according to its Terms and Conditions, you may not use DeepL Translator for the translation of texts containing personal data of any kind.
The translation of personal data is only possible as part of a DeepL Pro subscription (please see section 4).

==========
Texts and Translations - DeepL Pro
When using our DeepL Pro subscription to translate texts, the texts or documents you submit will not be permanently stored and will only be kept temporarily to the extent necessary for the production and transmission of the translation.
After complete performance of the contractually agreed services all submitted texts or documents and their translations will be deleted.
==========
When using DeepL Pro, your texts will not be used to improve the quality of our services.
For further information on the processing of your data within the DeepL Pro subscription, please refer to section 5 of this privacy policy and our DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions.
Please note that using DeepL Pro for the translation of texts containing personal data of any kind is only permitted if there is a justification for this under data protection law.
Therefore, our T&C provide for the conclusion of a data processing agreement (see section 8.1.3 of DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions).
To enter into such an agreement, please contact sales(at)deepl.com.

Registration and Signing up for a DeepL Pro Subscription
5.1.
Registration and Login at DeepL
In order to sign up for and subsequently use your DeepL Pro subscription, you will need to register and create an account at DeepL.
To ensure that you can log in, the following personal data will be stored:
E-mail address
Password
IP address
We process this data as part of the contract initiation process based on Art. 6 para.
==========
1 sentence 1 lit.
b) GDPR.
Your IP address is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para.
1 sentence 1 lit.
f) GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interests to match your IP address with IP addresses that have misused our service in the past for fraud prevention purposes.
==========
If you do not take out a DeepL Pro subscription after registering, your data will be deleted after one month.
If your company uses Single Sign-On (SSO) to log in to DeepL, there is no need for a separate registration with DeepL.
When you log in via Single Sign-On your company transmits your email address as well as your first and last name directly to us.
We also process this data on the basis of Art. 6 para.
==========
1 sentence 1 lit.
b) GDPR.
5.2.
==========
Signing up for DeepL Pro
If you sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription after registering, the following personal data will also be collected and processed for the purposes of concluding and fulfilling the contract and preparing invoices:
First name, surname, and where applicable, company name
Address
Payment details
Tax numbers (where applicable)
Selected subscription option
Possibly other, additional data you provided during the registration process.
In order to process payments, we forward the necessary payment data to our authorized payment service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd, Block 4, Harcourt Centre, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2, Ireland.
==========
Where necessary, Stripe will transfer the data to Stripe, Inc., located in the USA.
Further information on data protection at Stripe and compliance with the requirements of Art. 44 GDPR can be found here and here.
==========
We have concluded a data processing agreement with Stripe, which allows Stripe to process the data solely in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes.
In addition to the aforementioned data, we process further (usage-)data relevant for the provision and billing of our service, such as subscription ID, time of the subscription conclusion, billing period, successful payment processing, log-ins, number of translated characters and documents, upgrades and downgrades.
The processing and storage of the aforementioned data is necessary for the conclusion of the contract as well as its performance and is therefore justified according to Art. 6 para.
==========
1 sentence 1 lit.
b) GDPR.
==========
We store the data for the duration of the contract term and subsequently, if applicable, for the duration of statutory retention periods, insofar as these prescribe the retention for the respective types of data.
We will delete your account if you wish to do so after cancelling your subscription.
Otherwise, we will maintain your account so that it can be reactivated for you in the event of a renewed subscription without you having to register again.
This is in accordance with our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para.
==========
1 sentence 1 lit.
f) GDPR.
==========
In your account in the section “usage”, you can also view data about your usage behaviour e.g., - depending on your subscription - the number of characters translated in the past or the number of documents translated.
If you have a consumption-based subscription, such as the DeepL API Pro, you can also view the monthly costs incurred.
We justify this data processing based on our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para.
==========
1 sentence 1 lit.
f) GDPR, as we seek to meet our customers' wish to visualise information on usage behaviour in a transparent manner and the graphical representation of the development of consumption over the contract period is considered to be also in the interest of our customers.
5.3.
==========
Processing of the Submitted Texts and Translations
We process the texts you submit to DeepL Pro and their translations only temporarily, insofar as this is necessary for the creation and transmission of the translation.
The processing is therefore justified by Art. 6 para.
==========
1 sentence 1 lit.
b) GDPR.
==========
Your texts and the translations will - within the framework of the contractual agreements and as stated in section 4 - not be stored permanently and will be deleted after the performance of the contractually owed service.
If you use our glossary feature and store certain term pairs there, this data will be forwarded to our servers and stored for your account.
If you want to use the glossary function as part of our service, the data processing that takes place in this context is necessary for the performance of our contract and is therefore also justified by Art. 6 para.
==========

Translation of documents
6.1.
Translation of .
==========
docx and .
pptx Documents with DeepL Translator and DeepL Pro
You can translate documents in .
docx and .
==========
pptx format both with DeepL Pro as well as with DeepL Translator.
When using document translation in DeepL Translator, section 3 of this privacy policy applies.
If you translate documents of the file types mentioned above while you are logged in to your DeepL Pro account, the texts you submit will only be processed temporarily and will be deleted after the completion of the translation process, including the translations themselves (see also section 4 and 5.3 of this privacy policy).
6.2.
Translation of PDF documents with DeepL Translator and DeepL Pro
DeepL offers the translation of PDF documents for both DeepL Translator and DeepL Pro; in this respect, section 6.1 applies accordingly.
Please note the following specifics: The actual translation of your documents will continue to be provided exclusively by DeepL and processed on our infrastructure in the EEA.
In order to be able to translate PDF documents, it is necessary for technical reasons to convert the content of the PDF files into formatted text.
==========
For this purpose, we use the API of Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 4-6 Riverwalk, City West Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland ("Adobe API").
The PDF documents are sent to the Adobe API, converted there, sent back to DeepL in the required format and translated by DeepL.
The infrastructure of Adobe Inc., 345 Park Ave, San Jose, CA 95110, USA, is also used in the conversion process.
To make the text translated by DeepL available to you again in PDF format, the Adobe API is used once more (this time in reverse order).
Adobe stores the files received on its servers for a maximum period of 24 hours.
==========
We have concluded a data processing agreement with Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited and therefore the transferred data may only be processed according to our instructions.
To justify the data transfer to the USA, Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited and Adobe Inc. have agreed on EU standard contractual clauses, Art. 46 para.
==========
2 lit.
c) DSGVO.
==========
Further information on the handling of personal data at Adobe can be found here.
If you upload documents containing personal data for PDF translation as a DeepL Pro customer in accordance with section 4 of this privacy policy, we will process this data in accordance with your express instructions.
You give us this instruction by confirming before each translation of a PDF document that you want to translate it using the Adobe API.
As a DeepL Pro customer, you have the option of permanently saving the instruction in the translation settings of your account.
==========
For team accounts, the translation of PDF documents is only possible after prior authorisation by the team administrator.
When using the DeepL API Pro, we cannot ask you for your instruction before each translation of a PDF document for technical reasons.
You therefore give us your instruction by allowing the use of this function in your account settings prior to translating PDF documents.
==========
You can adjust your instruction at any time in the translation settings in your account.
In consequence, we will ask you again for your confirmation before each translation of a PDF document.
Further explanations on how to manage your translation settings depending on the DeepL Pro subscription you have chosen can be found here.
Free users who want to translate PDF documents with DeepL Translator will also find further information there.
If you choose not to translate PDF documents, your texts will still be processed exclusively within the European Economic Area.
6.3.
Temporary Storage of Metadata when Translating Documents
Regardless of whether you use our paid or free service when translating documents, particularly the following data is stored for each translation process:
Status/progress of the translation process
Document file type
Selected language pair for translation
Estimates of time needed for the translation
References to the applied glossary (when using DeepL Pro)
Content of the applied glossary (when using the free translator)
Number of characters calculated
Errors that occurred during the translation process
This information is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para.
==========
1 sentence 1 lit.
f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the functionality of our products, as this makes it easier to identify any sources of error related to the translation process.
The data is stored in a database that can only be accessed by selected employees and is automatically deleted after 14 days.

DeepL Apps
In addition to the translation service on our website, we also offer apps for Windows and macOS operating systems, as well as a mobile app for iOS, through which you can also translate texts.
You can use the Windows, macOS and iOS apps in both the free version and the paid Pro version.
Section 3 of this privacy policy therefore also applies to the use of the apps in the free version, and sections 4 and 5 apply to the use of the Pro version.
The Windows and macOS apps use the same interfaces for creating translations as the web-based service, therefore sections 6 and 7 of this privacy policy also apply to the use of the apps.
When you download our apps from app stores, your hardware ID, the IP address of your device and, if applicable, a customer ID such as your Apple ID are collected.
We have no influence on this data collection, therefore the data protection conditions of Apple and Windows apply, which you can access here and here respectively.
When translating texts with our apps, for technical reasons - regardless of whether you use our paid or free service - your device will automatically transmit certain data.
The following data which you can transmit to us, is stored:
Date and time of access
Version of the app
Operating system

If you do not (or no longer) agree to their use in the respective app, you can delete the app and alternatively use the web-based service where you can manage your settings in this regard.
No cookies are used in the iOS app.
However, a unique user ID (no cross-device ID) is used, which allows us to track, for example, the source and target language settings, how many characters are translated, whether the copy button is used, and if so, how it is used.
The processing of this data is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para.
