Email This Auction to a Friend Service.
The terms applicable to the Email This Auction to a Friend service apply to your use of that service.
Without limiting the foregoing, you may not use the service to send spam.
==========
We do not use the email addresses you enter for any purpose other than to send your email.
We do not rent or sell these email addresses.
Indeed, we generally discard the email addresses at some point after they have been used to send your email.
==========
Control of Your Password.
Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your eBay password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password as detailed in Section 8.
You may, however, disclose your password to certain third parties with whom eBay has entered into specific contractual and technical arrangements designed to safeguard your password ("Authorized Password Users"), in order to enjoy the benefits of those third parties' services in relation to the eBay services.
The current list of Authorized Password Users may be found here, and such list may be changed by eBay at any time and without notice.
==========
Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information.
Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted during registration including:
		Your User ID and email address.
If you change your User ID we keep track of your old User ID(s) and your new User ID.
Your name, company, address, city, state, zip code, country, primary phone number, secondary phone number, fax number and gender.
Your password.
==========
Your credit card number and expiration date, if you supplied one.
You must promptly update your information if it changes.
Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our chat rooms or other message areas or the feedback area.
Upon your request, we will remove your credit card number and credit card expiration date from our databases.
To make this request, email privacy@ebay.com.
==========
Such information will be removed after one billing cycle of your last sale on eBay unless your account is in dispute, in which case your information will be kept on file until the dispute is resolved.
However, if you have a free email service account or are otherwise required to provide a credit card for other reasons, you may not request to remove your credit card from file unless you wish to terminate your account or place a different credit card on file.
We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement.
Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems.
Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.
==========
Other Information Collectors.
Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our system or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them.
==========
To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies.
Since eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party.
We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
==========
Security.
eBay uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers.
However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
