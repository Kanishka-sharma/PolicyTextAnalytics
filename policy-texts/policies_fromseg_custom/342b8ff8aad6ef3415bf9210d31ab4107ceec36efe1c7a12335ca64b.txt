Job applicants.
If your personal information is submitted through our websites when applying for a position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application.
We may retain your personal information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future available positions.
This information may be shared with the other IAC companies for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications for the particular position or other available positions, as well as with third-party service providers retained by us to collect, maintain and analyze candidate submissions for job postings.
==========
Please review "Your choices about collection and use of your information" below.
We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our websites or while using our services.
Personal information.
We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared.
We may share all types of personal information with:
Authorized service providers: We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf in connection with your request for a loan.
==========
These service providers may include credit bureaus, title companies, flood or other insurance providers, appraisal companies, escrow companies, closing agents, other financial institutions, marketing and customer services firms, credit card payment processors, as well as companies that support contests, sweepstakes, surveys, or other features offered through our websites, or that provide business analysis or website support.
These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.
Business partners: When you express interest in promotions offered through our websites or our services, we may share your expression of interest with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes.
When you elect to engage in a particular offer or program, you authorize us to provide your e-mail address and other information to that business.
==========
Other lenders or investors.
If you submit a completed LendingTree or GetSmart Loan Qualification Form ("QF"), we may share your personal information with lenders on the LendingTree network with whom you are or may be matched, or if you are matched with LendingTree Loans, third party investors to whom we intend to transfer your loan after closing.
If you finish the first page of the LendingTree QF (by hitting the "continue" button on "Page 1: Tell Us About Your Loan") but leave portions of the QF incomplete, we may share your personal information with lenders on the LendingTree network or with LendingTree Loans, who may help you complete your loan request and possibly extend loan offers to you.
==========
However, no credit check will be performed by LendingTree unless you authorize us to do so by submitting a completed QF.
The lenders with whom you are matched (i.e., the lenders with whom LendingTree shares your information) will be disclosed to you, and LendingTree will not share information with other lenders not disclosed to you.
Because the lenders on the LendingTree network with whom you are matched may retain or use your personal information whether or not you qualify for, or obtain, a loan from them, you should contact these lenders directly concerning their privacy and information sharing practices.
==========
Other IAC businesses.
We are part of the IAC family of businesses (go to www.iac.com for a listing of these businesses).
We may share information we collect, including personal information, with the IAC companies (some of which are nonfinancial companies).
Sharing information with the IAC companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.
All IAC companies comply with the IAC Consumer Privacy.
The IAC companies also will comply with applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages from that company in the future.
However, in no circumstance will LendingTree share with other IAC companies any personally identifiable information that you provide to us if that information bears on your creditworthiness.
Special notice to California residents: LendingTree will not share any personal information about you with other IAC companies to the extent prohibited by applicable California law or to the extent your prior consent to share is required by applicable California law.
==========
Other Situations.
We also may disclose your information:
In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
==========
In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information.
Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties.
These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.
==========
Aggregated and non-personal information.
We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances.
We may also share it with third parties and IAC companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties.
We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources.
We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.
==========
For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our websites and the most popular features or services accessed.
This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.
Third-party websites.
There are a number of places on our websites where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our websites, you may be taken to a website that we do not control.
These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites.
We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
==========
If you have submitted a QF to us, you can update your personal information by contacting our Customer Care Department for assistance.
More information about how to contact us is provided below.
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our websites because such information may be required in order for you to obtain services from LendingTree.
Federal and state regulations require that we store completed loan QFs for various periods of time.
==========
In order to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to delete your information from the LendingTree database.
When you initially use our websites, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive e-mail messages or newsletters from LendingTree.
You may later modify your choice by contacting our Customer Care Department at 1-800-411-TREE.
You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future.
==========
It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.
We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as loan offers, requests for additional information, service updates or announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us.
If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
Under our Do Not Call policy you may instruct us not to call you for marketing purposes by calling our Customer Care Department at 1-800-411-TREE.
We will implement your instructions within 30 days.
We have policies and procedures in place and train our employees to honor your request.
Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes.
If you do not want us to send you postal mail for marketing purposes, you may remove your name from current and future mailing lists by contacting our Customer Care Department at 1-800-411-TREE.
==========
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
For example, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
==========
We want you to feel confident using our websites to transact business.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information.
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
==========
If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information with third parties and the IAC companies for their direct marketing purposes.
California law gives you the right to send us a request at a designated address to receive the following information:
the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year
the names and addresses of the third parties that received that information; and
if the nature of the third party’s business cannot be determined from their name, examples of the products or services marketed.
We may provide this information in a standardized format that is not specific to you.
The designated e-mail address for these requests is privacy@lendingtree.com.
==========
Children’s privacy
Our websites are general audience sites, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
Visiting our websites from outside the United States
This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our websites from residents of the United States.
If you are visiting our websites from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
==========
Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.
By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
No Rights of Third Parties
This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of our websites.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services.
When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
==========
If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our websites.
We recommend that you check our websites from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.
