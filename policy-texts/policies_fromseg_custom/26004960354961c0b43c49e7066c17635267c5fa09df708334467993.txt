Grabit Interactive Media Inc. dba Kerv Interactive PRIVACY POLICY
When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information.
We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.
This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.
Effective May 30, 2018
We build a range of services that help millions of people to explore and interact with the world in new ways.
==========
Our services include:
Patented overlay video technology, which allows all objects within video assets to be interactive, shoppable, and linked out
Overlay technology for banners, allowing all objects to be interactive and link out
Hosting services for creative assets- both banner and video
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded videos
OPT-OUT ALIGNMENT AND DETAILS:
MOBILE:
From iOS 6.1 onward, users can now reset the Advertising Identifier on any iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.
This means you can basically throw all the anonymously gathered data about a device that is used to serve relevant ads out the window and start fresh, thereby removing any of the targeted data that has been accumulated and assigned to that Advertising ID.
Open “Settings” then choose “General” followed by “About”
Scroll all the way down and locate “Advertising”, from there tap on “Reset Advertising Identifier” and confirm the ID reset
Once confirmed, iOS will regenerate a new random blank ID.
==========
You can also go the extra mile and turn iOS ad tracking off completely while you’re at that settings screen, which functions like a “Do Not Track” feature and prevents any of anonymous data accumulation from happening.
What that will do is completely deny the ability for anonymous data to be gathered about the device to serve more relevant ads, outside of web cookies.
DESKTOP:
Cookies These little files hide in your computer so that your browser and websites can track your browsing sessions and save certain useful information, such as account names and passwords, for later retrieval.
==========
Although cookies may seem harmless overall, they can threaten your privacy if an attacker tries to use them maliciously.
Because of that threat, most modern browsers make cookie storage easy to understand and control.
They also make it simple to remove individual website cookies, or even to delete cookies from your computer entirely.
Here’s how you can perform the latter task in some of the most popular browsers.
How to delete Cookies in Google Chrome
If you’re running Google Chrome version 14 or higher, click the wrench button in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window.
==========
From there, select Options.
In the navigation pane of the Options page, click Under the Hood.
Under the Privacy section, click Content Settings.
Click the “All cookies and site data” button in the Content Settings window.
How to delete Cookies in Firefox
Make sure you’re running the latest version of the Firefox browser, and then select the Firefox menu.
==========
From there, select Options and then Options again.
Click the Privacy tab to bring up your user-privacy options.
==========
Under the History section, click the Remove Individual Cookies link.
Click the Remove All Cookies button to zap them.
At the bottom of the Cookies window that appears, click the Remove All Cookies button to delete all cookies associated with your Firefox browser.
How to delete Cookies in Safari
Confirm that you’re running version 5 or later of Apple’s Safari browser, and then click the Gears menu in the upper-right corner of the Safari window.
From there, select Reset Safari.
==========
In this window, check the bottom box, ‘Remove all website data’.
Check the bottom box, labeled Remove all website data.
You can uncheck everything else if you want to remove only cookies.
==========
Click the Reset button to eliminate all cookies associated with Safari.
How to delete Cookies in Internet Explorer
Upgrade to the latest version of Internet Explorer.
Select the Tools menu from the Internet Explorer window, and click Delete Browsing History.
==========
In the Delete Browsing History window, check the box next to Cookies.
You can uncheck everything else if you want to remove only cookies.
From here you can choose which parts of your browsing history to erase.
Click Delete to remove all cookies stored in Internet Explorer.
Congratulations, you’ve successfully cleaned out your browser’s cookie cabinet.
Although cookie files pose a potential threat to privacy, don’t forget that they can also improve your Web browsing by making it faster and more convenient.
==========
Reasons why you might want to reset the Advertising Identifier
Keeping in mind that all of the accumulated data is anonymous, there isn’t some universally important reason to reset the Ad ID and by no means should it be considered standard procedure.
Because the data is anonymized, the reasons to reset the ID tend to be fairly unique situations:
The ads you are being served are tied to past activities that are no longer relevant to your interests
You or your employer are particularly sensitive about privacy
Your iOS device is company-owned, and you don’t want IT to (potentially) discover that you’re searching the web for things unrelated to work by having ads for unrelated stuff show up on the device
You are transferring an iOS device to a new owner or family member, and you don’t want to go all out and reset to factory settings for some reason
Of course, there are other reasons as well, but again it’s important to stress this isn’t some super important thing to think about for 99.5% of iOS users.
For some historical background, the Advertising Identifier is a relatively new creation, and previously advertisers tracked anonymous data by the actual device UDID.
Because the UDID is tied to hardware and not possible to reset, Apple created the Advertising ID as an alternative to the UDID, one which can be freely reset and directly controlled by the user much like cookies and browser history can be managed at any time.
==========
INFORMATION Grabit Interactive Media Inc. dba Kerv Interactive COLLECTS
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better experiences across all produced content — from figuring out basic interests through interaction behavior, to more complex things like which ads or content you will find useful.
For example, if you interact with content that has luxury cars, you may want to see more content and/or ads that have luxury cars.
We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby food delivery service if you show interest or interaction with a local food service.
==========
The information Grabit Interactive Media Inc. dba Kerv Interactive collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you manage your browser and publisher level controls.
When controls allow, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to browser (chrome, firefox, etc), browser version (Chrome 66.4), platform (windows, mac, etc.), mobile versus desktop along with device operating system.
This helps better curate content and products that you would actually be interested in interacting with and/or purchasing.
We do not ever collect personal information, defined as your name, email address, or billing information.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use when interacting with our technology.
This helps us to provide features such as swiping versus clicking functionality when interacting with our video technology.
==========
The information we collect includes browser type, device type and settings, and operating system.
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device.
==========
Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device.
For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices and can be managed in your device’s settings.
Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone.
For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
==========
We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.
We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like retargeting content you might like.
The activity information we collect may include:
Videos you watch
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads or embedded content, so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers and publishers, like telling them whether we served their ad or content on a page and whether the ad was interacted with, and how deep that interaction was.
Purchase activity if client pixels or macros are in place
People with whom you communicate or share content if sharing features are utilized within the technology/services
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Your location information
We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.
Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:
GPS
IP Address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address.
==========
These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks.
An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.
The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings.
For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app.
==========
In some cases, Grabit Interactive Media Inc. dba Kerv Interactive may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to.
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
==========
We may also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.
For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns.
We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
==========
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as application data caches, databases, and server logs.
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.
When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.
Cookies may store user preferences and other information.
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
==========
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for tracking certain activities, such as views of a website or when an email is opened.
Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
An application data cache is a data repository on a device.
It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
