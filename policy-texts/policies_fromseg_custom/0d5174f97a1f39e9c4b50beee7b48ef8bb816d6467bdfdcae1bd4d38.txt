Cookies
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.
Scroll cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.
The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.
We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Scroll’s coolest features.

Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website.
We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.
==========

Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below:
Scroll Personnel: Scroll personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of Scroll business.

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.
Moreover, if Scroll, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.
The conditions of this Privacy Policy will be binding and applicable on all entities who may acquire your personal information as part of the transferred assets.
Protection of Scroll and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Scroll, our employees, our users, or others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Syndication: Scroll allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the Scroll website.

All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.

We keep it secure, and you must also keep it safe.
Our employees may not access your account unless required to do a specific job.
