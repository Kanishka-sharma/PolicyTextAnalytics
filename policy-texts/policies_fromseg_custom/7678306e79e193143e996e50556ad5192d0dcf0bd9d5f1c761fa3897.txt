INTERNET SECURITY:



Safeguarding your personal information is important to us.
We have implemented
the following measures to enhance the protection of your personal information.
==========
Secure Socket Layer:

Secure Socket Layer or SSL is a protocol for transmitting
private documents via the Internet.
SSL
works by using a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL
connection.
The protection strength of
SSL is determined by the bit length.
Currently, Merrick Bank uses the latest and most powerful bit length
allowed by law, which is 128 bit encryption.
Most browsing software, including the most popular Netscape Navigator
4.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0, support SSL, and many web sites use the protocol
to transmit confidential user information provided by consumers, such as credit
card numbers.
By convention, web pages
that require an SSL connection start with https: instead of http:.
==========
Authentication:

Authentication is the process of identifying an
individual, based on a unique username and password.
Authentication ensures that the individual is who he or she
claims to be.
Authentication techniques
are used when customers access their Merrick Bank account on-line.
Authorization:

Authorization is the process of allowing the individual
access to the appropriate data, after an individual has been properly
identified by an authentic user name and password.
==========
Encryption:
Encryption is the translation of data into a secret code, and is an
effective way to achieve data security.
Merrick Bank uses encryption to
protect sensitive information such as the transmission and storage of
application data.
To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a
secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it.
Unencrypted data is
called "plain text," encrypted data is referred to as "cipher text."
==========
Firewall:
A firewall is designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private
network.
Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a
combination of the two.
Firewalls are frequently used to prevent
unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the
Internet.
Firewalls are designed to protect sensitive customer data from
misuse.
==========
Multiple Firewalls are used by Merrick Bank directly or indirectly
through contracts with third party vendors.
Testing and Maintenance Devices:
Hardware Utilization logs are created on hardware components that comprise
the Merrick Bank web site.
Intrusion Detection:
An intrusion detection system (IDS) attempts to detect an
intruder breaking into the system or a legitimate user misusing system
resources.
IDS software is used at Merrick Bank's web site and is constantly
working to provide notification when suspicious or illegal activity is detected.
Email:
Through the use of an online form, all communications
with sensitive customer information are sent in a secure socket layer.
Merrick Bank discourages customers from sending sensitive information to us
using Email.
Physical Security:

All servers associated with Merrick Bank's web site are in
locations secured by restricted electronic badge access.
The number of people who have access to the
servers is restricted to those necessary to maintain the server hardware.

Merrick Bank wants to help you protect your computer and

We have compiled the
following tips for you to do this.

     physical access to your personal computer ("PC") to prevent unauthorized
     use.
Do
     not leave your PC unattended while transacting business on-line.
If you need to walk away from your PC,
     log-off or sign-off before doing so.
==========

     select passwords that will be difficult for others to guess.

     not give your password to anyone.

programs from the Internet, launch Email attachments or share diskettes.
Merrick Bank encourages you to employ safe
computing practices that include the following:


Do not run programs from any source you do not trust completely.
Use virus protection software.
==========
Stay informed about security issues.
PC Software:

Understand and use the security features provided by your PC software.
Ensure that your web browser uses the strongest encryption available and be aware of the level of encryption used when you connect to various sites and applications.
Use software licensed only from reliable vendors.
Stay informed of the latest release and patch levels of the PC software you use.
==========
PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY AND ACCOUNTS:


Did you know that up to 500,000 individuals each year are
victims of identity theft, a fast-growing form of fraud?
"Identity theft" or "account takeover fraud"
involves criminals stealing a person's personal information.
These criminals assume a person's identity
and apply for and use credit in the victim's name, harming the victim's credit
record.
The following information may help you avoid becoming a
victim:

 


AVOID BECOMING A VICTIM:

Don't give your Social Security or account number to
     anyone over the phone unless you initiated the call.
==========
Tear up receipts, old account statements and unused credit card offers before
     throwing them away.
Criminals can
     steal information from your trash and use it to get credit in your name.
Review your account and credit card statements as soon as you receive them to
     check for unauthorized transactions.
Protect your PINs and computer passwords; use a combination of letters and numbers
     and change them often.
==========
Never carry this information with you!
Obtain each year a copy of your credit report to make sure your repayment
     information is being correctly reported.
If you have recently been denied credit, you are entitled to a free
     credit report within 60 days of the date you receive notice of such denial.
Under other circumstances, you may be
     charged a small fee.
You can call any of the three national credit reporting agencies to get a copy of your
     credit report:
     (1) Trans Union 800-888-4213;
      800-685-1111; or
     (2) 
Equifax 800-685-1111; or
     (3) Experian 888-397-3742.
Report any suspected fraud to your bank or relevant credit card issuer
     immediately so they can prevent unauthorized use of your account.
==========
By following the above tips, you can help protect yourself
against this terrible crime.
