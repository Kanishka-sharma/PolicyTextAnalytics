A. Terms of Service for Job Seekers
1.
Job Ads or Job Listings
Indeed may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through Indeed’s search results or otherwise through the Site.
Searching for Job Ads on Indeed is free for Job Seekers.
Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that Indeed has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site.
For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site.
==========
If you leave the Indeed Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party.
Employer websites may have conversion trackers or use APIS and other functionality provided by Indeed, which informs us that an application has been completed on an Employer site.
An Employer who installs such functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law.
==========
However, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website.
You agree to Indeed’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such conversion tracker functionality.
==========
Except for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner.
Indeed has no obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads, in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site or your search result for any or no reason.
You understand and agree that Indeed has no obligation to present you with any or all Job Ads.
==========
We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, Company Pages, screener questions and responses, and assessments.
Additionally, Indeed may provide search options to narrow down Job Ads search results by job type categories (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Ads.
Indeed may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone.
==========
Placement of a Job Ad on a certain page (for example, on Indeed Gigs) is not a representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes.
While Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Indeed job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising.
Indeed displays Job Ads based on a combination of employer bids and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on Indeed.
==========
You are not permitted to use Indeed’s Site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes.
For purposes of this Section A of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker.
==========
Indeed may provide functionality to call a telephone number contained in a Job Ad using the phone app on a mobile device.
Indeed cannot guarantee that the extracted phone number is the correct phone number for the Employer or for the Job Ad you are viewing.
2.
==========
Resumes, Profile, and Recommended Jobs
By creating a public resume through the Site (“Indeed Resume”) or uploading a file resume on the Site (collectively, “Your Resume” or “Job Seeker Resume”), you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available Your Resume to third parties, such as Employers, that Indeed believes may have an interest in Your Resume.
If you do not want Indeed to make available Your Resume to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Resume and uploaded file resume to private.
Setting Your Resume to private will not affect your previous applications or prevent employers you responded to from contacting you.
You can read more about resume privacy here.
==========
By creating an Indeed Resume or uploading a file resume on Indeed, Indeed may share with you Job Ads that match the contents of Your Resume.
Indeed may also highlight to you items in Your Resume that may match qualifications from the Job Ad, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Ad and may be missing from Your Resume.
==========
These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it.
Applying for such Job Ads does not guarantee job interviews or hiring.
Even where Indeed highlights items or a Job Ad is shared with you, Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Ads or highlights.
==========
By creating or uploading Your Resume, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed, or an Indeed vendor, to review or scan Your Resume and provide you feedback (in Indeed’s discretion), including suggested changes.
Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any changes you make based on any provided feedback.
Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the resume or application information you post, send or receive through the Site.
By uploading a file resume on the Site, you agree that Indeed may convert your file resume to a different file type.
==========
It is your responsibility to review Your Resume to ensure that the content appears as you intend, and that it contains the right information or any information you intend to include or update.
If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so.
It may take a few days for updates to your account or resume to be reflected.
==========
To mitigate fraud, Indeed may mask or hide your contact information, for example, we may mask or hide your email address and/or phone number, from Your Resume or application and may substitute it with an alias.
Indeed makes no promise to you about whether all or part of your contact info will be masked or hidden, and the decision to mask or hide such info is in Indeed’s sole discretion.
Indeed reserves the right to limit your ability to set Your Resume to public, and may toggle a public resume to private, at any time, to prevent illegal conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in Indeed’s discretion.
==========
If you have an Indeed account, an Indeed Resume, or an uploaded file resume, you agree that Indeed may associate Your Resume data with your profile on Indeed (“Indeed Profile”).
Your Indeed Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Profile” section of your account.
This includes your Indeed Resume, your scores on any Indeed Assessments you may have taken and any information in the “About me” section, such as your desired job title, job types, work schedule, whether you are ready to work, or pay.
==========
Information in your Indeed Profile, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers.
If you do not want Indeed to make your Indeed Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Resume and uploaded file resume to private or remove Your Resume.
==========
Your response to an Indeed Assessment will be associated with your Indeed Profile.
You may choose whether your Indeed Assessment response is available to Employers viewing your Indeed Profile.
==========
You can enable the ready to work feature on your profile to let Employers know that you can start work immediately.
After 60 days, we will automatically remove that feature from your profile, but you can manually enable it again.
==========
Indeed may also automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to create an Indeed account or apply to a job.
Indeed may determine what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, any information you input on the Site about yourself (including in Your Resume), searches you run on the Site, jobs you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job application to an Employer through Indeed.
3.
Applying to Jobs Through Indeed
Any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener questions and assessments (“Indeed Apply”), is subject to this Agreement (including Section D.3.)
==========
and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Prior to submitting an application, you acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing and confirming that you are applying to your desired Employer.
==========
Once you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, resume, email, or otherwise), Indeed does not have control over the Employer’s use or disclosure of that information.
If you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer.
(All references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed”, “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references mean “Indeed Apply.”)
==========
Indeed may use your application materials to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Indeed may reach out to you about such Job Listing.
Indeed may store such information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site.
To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Indeed services.
==========
In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply or by RSVPing to a hiring event you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s).
When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or Indeed’s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message.
You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf.
==========
When you apply for a job on Indeed you agree to Indeed’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement.
Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
When you apply to a job using Indeed Apply, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent.
==========
We cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon.
Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.
Further, Indeed does not guarantee that the interface will be error-free.
==========
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
Please note that Job Ads may expire between the time you submit your application and from the time it is received.
Indeed has no responsibility for expired Job Ads or for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad’s expiration.
==========
In addition we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers.
We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs).
==========
If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored on Indeed, do not use the Indeed Apply or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system.
You may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through Indeed.
By using the Indeed Apply system, you fully consent to the above.
==========
If you require alternative methods of screening or application you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process.
By using Indeed, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s job application, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer.
==========
Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers.
Some questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer.
==========
Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application.
Indeed may inform Job Seekers that an Employer’s requirement from a job description does not appear to be present on a resume or application; this information is presented without warranty and Indeed does not guarantee that updating a resume or application will result in any job offer.
Indeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs.
Indeed cannot make any guarantee regarding health and safety measures in an Employer’s hiring or interviewing process.
==========
Indeed recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization or similar institution.
Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.
Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.
==========
Indeed may send you a notice relating to account security, such as informing you that you may have recently interacted with a compromised account.
Indeed cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Indeed bears no responsibility for doing so.
Indeed makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.
==========
Indeed may use your application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of your activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa.
You agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to Employers as matches or not matches.
Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).
Indeed may also highlight to you items in your prior application materials (including items in your resume and past responses to screener questions) that may match qualifications from the Job Listing, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Listing that may not match your application materials.
==========
These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it.
Applying for such Job Listings does not guarantee job interviews or hiring.
Even where Indeed highlights items or a Job Listing is shared with you, Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Listings or highlights.
==========
By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist.
Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application.
These notices are automatically sent after a period of time selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Indeed their interest in your application.
You acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application on Indeed within the time period selected by the Employer.
Any interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and would not by themselves prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.
When you search for jobs on the Indeed Job Search app and proceed to apply for a job, including jobs on third party sites, Indeed may suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in your application.
It is your responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them on your application.
==========
For Job Seekers located in Japan, you acknowledge that when contacted by Indeed, presented as Indeed Hire (hereinafter referred to as “Indeed Hire Japan”), Indeed is acting as an employment placement business provider (as defined under applicable law).
Indeed Hire Japan offers the services in accordance with these terms and the rules set forth in its website.
Indeed Hire Japan will only send you Job Listings that Indeed Hire Japan determines may be of interest to you.
You may also end your relationship with Indeed Hire Japan at any time.
4.
==========
Communications and Other Actions on the Site
When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, messages, applications, questions and responses in applications, and any other information) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.
When an Employer views, sends, stores or receives materials through or using the Site, Indeed may inform you about such actions.
Additionally, we may also inform you that an Employer has taken other actions with regards to a Job Ad, your Resume, or your application, such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening your Resume or application, viewing your Resume or application, responding to your Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to your application or Job Ad.
Indeed may inform the Employer about activities you take on the Site or your use of the Site, for example, whether you are online or active on Indeed, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.
If you have turned on browser push notification and wish to turn them off, you may do so by visiting the settings on your browser.
==========
Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled interviews with you.
In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your phone number and that you have the right to accept text messages at the number.
Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interview and you agree to accept such text message reminder on your cell phone, including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.
You acknowledge that if the words “automated,” “automatic,” or similar words are used on the Site in connection with calls or text messages, these words do not refer to the generation or storage of a phone number.
==========
Indeed only calls the number that you generated and stored when you provided your number to Indeed.
In the event you change your phone number, you agree to promptly update your Indeed account with the new number.
You agree that by providing your phone number or using the Site, you are establishing a business relationship with Indeed and that Indeed may send you text messages in connection with that relationship.
==========
Please note that since these text message services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those providers.
We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive such text messages.
==========
Indeed may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties.
Please note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy and that such calls are not placed through or tracked by Indeed.
==========
Your standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply.
You may receive messages, including but not limited to text messages, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or an Employer’s (in the event you applied for a job) activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site.
==========
In all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them.
For example, if you accept an interview request, it is your responsibility to follow up with the employer separately to ensure they know your response, do not rely on notifications through Indeed.
Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
==========
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
Indeed may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Employer.
Once an Employer has your contact info, you agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which the Employer uses the info.
Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias.
==========
If you send or receive communication on or through the Site, you agree to your communication being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.
Indeed may enable chatbots, which allows you to take certain actions on the Site, such as apply to a job, schedule an interview, or otherwise interact with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“Chatbot”).
You understand that the Chatbot is an automated service that does not involve human interaction.
It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information submitted through the Chatbot.
Indeed is not responsible for any loss, damage or inconvenience arising as a consequence of the use (or inability to use) the Chatbot or from the information you submit via the Chatbot.
==========
Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable Indeed Chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify you that Indeed Chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer.
For Indeed Chat, you may access or view your messages by visiting your Indeed Chat messages dashboard.
Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Indeed Chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.
Please note that if you are using Indeed Chat to communicate with an Employer, Indeed will deliver your messages as instructed by the Employer.
5.
==========
Virtual Communications
Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual and remote communications using Indeed products, including but not limited to, Indeed Interview, Indeed Hiring Platform, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”).
You understand that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider and that Indeed is only providing the option for you to communicate with Employers via services that may be offered by third-party providers.
Please note that since these telecommunication services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers.
==========
We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive, transmit, or support such phone or video communications.
Indeed does not guarantee any aspect of your Virtual Interview experience including transmission of phone or video communications, quality of audio/visual content, data security, or data usage and restrictions.
==========
Indeed is not liable for any claims arising out of your use of Virtual Interviews and you release Indeed from any such claims.
You understand that Indeed does not guarantee the Employer’s schedule or availability for conducting Virtual Interviews and cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us.
You also understand that the Employer is responsible for any and all questions, comments, or hiring decisions made.
==========
Further, Employers are responsible for any accommodations you need during Virtual Interviews.
NOTICE – Virtual Interviews May be Recorded: You understand that an Employer may enable the recording of a Virtual Interview.
You agree to respect any notification (visual, audio, or otherwise) which may indicate that recording is enabled by an Employer on Virtual Interview.
If you do not agree to be recorded, you must immediately leave the Virtual Interview.
By using Virtual Interviews, you agree that the Virtual Interview may be recorded and that Indeed and third party providers can store and access the recording.
Also, you agree that an Employer activating the recording function, and subsequently accessing, storing, using, or analyzing the recording is outside of Indeed’s control.
YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT INDEED IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE RECORDING OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS, AND YOU RELEASE INDEED FROM ANY SUCH CLAIMS.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS.
==========
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
INDEED ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY DATA YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT THROUGH USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
6.
==========
Indeed Assessments
Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills assessments selected by Employers (“Assessments”) and responses from Job Seekers (“Responses”) through the Site.
Employers may use the Indeed Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses.
After you provide a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response.
If there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Job Seeker will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.
==========
An Assessment only evaluates a particular skill.
It does not evaluate a Job Seeker’s qualification for any job.
Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Job Seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by the Employer sending the Assessment and reviewing your Response.
Receiving or responding to an Assessment does not guarantee a job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further communication or action by any Employer.
An Employer is the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified Job Seeker.
==========
Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
The Employer is the sole party to determine whether to consider any retaken Assessments as part of their hiring process.
You acknowledge and understand that Employers (or their employment agencies) select which Assessments to associate with their job openings, and that Indeed does not choose the Assessments sent by Employers and has no control over Employers’ selection or use of Assessments.
You agree that the questions in any Assessment are solely being asked by the Employer sending the Assessment.
==========
You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law, and that the responsibility for offering any such alternative method lies solely with Employers.
If you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of Assessment, screening or application, you must indicate it to the Employer.
Indeed may provide a means by which you may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from the Employer; Indeed does not guarantee the Employer’s receipt of, or response to, any such request.
While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.
==========
You agree and acknowledge that the usefulness and value of Assessments and Responses depend on their contents being kept confidential.
You therefore agree to keep the content of Assessments and Responses confidential and to not reproduce or discuss them with anyone, except that you may communicate with an Employer about an Assessment they have sent to you and your Response.
Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Assessment or Response, or to include any Assessment or Response in the Site, and may exclude or remove any Assessment or Response from the Site for any or no reason without liability or notice.
==========
Assessment links sent to you may continue to be active after an Employer has paused or closed their job campaign on Indeed.
Once an Employer pauses or closes their Job Ad (for example, after the Employer has made a hire), Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will view any related notices or updates, including Assessments, Responses, and accommodation requests.
==========
You may still choose to take the Assessment for the purpose of adding its results to your Indeed Profile or for another job application.
Indeed may also offer you the option to select an Assessment to complete independent of a particular job, and your Response will be associated with your Indeed Profile.
You may choose whether the Response is available to Employers viewing your Indeed Profile, though Indeed will count the Response for purposes of generating aggregate Response statistics even if Your Response is hidden.
==========
As a Job Seeker, you consent to your Responses, applications, and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
You are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make your Response available to the Employer providing the Assessment, or (in the case of Assessments selected by you) to any Employer viewing Your Indeed Profile.
You understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to display or reformat Responses in a manner to permit Employers to review your Response together with Responses from other Job Seekers.
Indeed may aggregate the results of all Job Seeker-selected Assessments for the purpose of displaying the percentile for Your Response.
==========
You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Response to an Employer, that request cannot be canceled.
Indeed does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any Response, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
As a Job Seeker, you shall not create or send any Response which: (i) contains any highly confidential personal information, such as bank account or credit card information, online account information, social security numbers (or similar counterparts outside the United States of America), health information, or other categories of data subject to special breach notification requirements in any country; (ii) contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing); or (iii) directly or indirectly violates the Site Rules.
==========
Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool.
By using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Job Seekers to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine.
The sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Job Seekers as applicable.
As a Job Seeker, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries, may only be asserted against the Employer.
==========
Indeed is not a third party beneficiary of or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Job Seeker, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.

==========
Salary, Career, Hiring and Other Information Provided by Indeed
Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only.
For example, Indeed may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job Listing, or the likelihood that a particular event will occur such as being selected for an interview.
This information provided by Indeed is based on estimates given for informational purposes only and without warranty, and is subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.
==========
Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.
Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates.
These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only.
Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.
==========
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer” or “Hired on Indeed”.
Employers may also request that Indeed add such labels.
Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which Employers qualify.
==========
The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies.
Some of the data may be provided by the Employer and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such data.
Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge that is added to Employer names or Job Ads based on employer provided data, including data on Job Ads.
==========
Indeed may also display publicly available information about employers on Company Pages.
Information on Company Pages is presented for informational and promotional purposes only, is subject to change, and may be gathered from or generated by third parties.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Company Page.
Please contact the employer for the most accurate and up-to-date company information.
Similarly, career-related or hiring-related information provided by Indeed is for informational purposes only, and is in no way to be construed as professional career counseling or staffing services (unless otherwise expressly noted by Indeed in services such as Indeed Hire in Japan).
==========
You understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search.
You further understand that in providing any such career or hiring guides, Indeed is not acting as a job placement agency or staffing firm (unless otherwise expressly noted by Indeed in services such as Indeed Hire in Japan).
You also understand that by referring to or using such career or hiring guides, you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, or assurance of being hired, and you take full responsibility for use of these services or guides.

==========
Please note, the aforementioned actions do not include information sent to you by a third party, however, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site to correspond with a third party.
In addition, if you set Your Resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with third-party Employers.

If you do not want your Demographic Information to be used in this way, do not provide it to Indeed (or, if you have already provided your Demographic Information to Indeed, you can request it be removed).
You further acknowledge and agree that another Job Seeker’s Demographic Information is personal information, and to the extent permitted by law you waive any right to request or view Demographic Information pertaining to any other Job Seeker.

You also agree that Indeed may activate a chat bot, which enables Job Seekers to apply to your Job Ad by answering questions.
The answers a Job Seeker submits are presented to you as a job application.
When you use Indeed candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may make available functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate.
You agree that by using such candidate management tools, you are instructing Indeed to assemble the candidate’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document.
==========
You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements.
By using these tools, you are providing information to Indeed and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker.
For example, when you choose whether a qualification is preferred or required (including marking it as a deal breaker), this information may be highlighted to Job Seekers.
Additionally, you consent to any information shared through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed may store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.

You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Company Page, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason.
==========
Indeed further does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.
You are solely responsible for checking your Employer dashboard to view job applications and other information.
Any notifications, such as emails, you may receive about applications or other activities, are provided solely as a courtesy to you and you should not rely on them.
==========
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, including but not limited to an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Indeed’s relay functions, do not use the Indeed relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via the personal information provided in such Job Seeker’s resume or application or by whatever method you so choose.
When using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, however, Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by you.
In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom.
When you use the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add functions into the corresponding Indeed Apply emails.

If you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such candidates and set them to rejected in your candidate dashboard.
You further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately.
When you use Indeed’s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to “rejected”.
If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.
==========
You agree that Indeed may take action to try to identify and reduce spam applications, and that one method of doing so may include imposing a cover letter requirement for such applicants.
Indeed does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Indeed know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing.
You agree that Indeed Apply and Indeed’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.
By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions.
==========
You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.
You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions.

Indeed may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10% or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting such late payments.
==========
When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.
When you view, send, store or receive materials through or using the Site or when you simply use or visit the Site, Indeed may inform a Job Seeker that you have taken an action, for example, with regards to a Job Ad, Job Seeker’s Resume, or application such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening the Resume or application, viewing the Resume or application, responding to the Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to the application or Job Ad, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.
==========
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer” or “Hired on Indeed”.
Employers may also request that Indeed add such labels.
Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which Employers qualify.
The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies.
==========
Some of the data may be provided by the Employer and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such data.
Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge that is added to Employer names or Job Ads based on employer provided data, including data on Job Ads.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE ANY API AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF ANY INDEED API.
It is your responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App or the Site for the most up-to-date information (including, but not limited to, explanations about how features work, disclaimers and disclosures regarding the services provided, method for charging) about Indeed’s products and services.
By using an API, rather than directly using the Site or an Indeed App, you agree to all information provided on the Site or an Indeed App.
Use of an Application or ATS via an API, rather than direct use of the Site or an Indeed App, shall not excuse any lack of information or understanding about Indeed’s products and services where that information is otherwise provided on the Site or an Indeed App.
3.
==========
Job Match
Indeed may use Job Seekers’ application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of their activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of their resume and answers to screener questions match the words of your Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa.
You further agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to you as matches or not matches.
Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).
4.
==========
Salary, Applies or Other Information Provided by Indeed
Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only.
For example, Indeed may provide Job Seekers with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job listing, or provide you with estimated applies to your Job Listing.
All such figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.
If you are participating in the Indeed Ads Program and your Sponsored Job advertising budget is set on a per-apply basis, you will be charged based on Indeed’s determination of Apply count as reflected in your employer dashboard and not based on the number of applies that may be provided to Job Seekers for informational purposes only.
==========
Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.
Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates.
These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only.
Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.
==========
Indeed may also provide data regarding impressions in relation to your job ad.
Such figures are provided for informational purposes only, are subject to change at any time, and Indeed does not guarantee their accuracy.
Indeed reserves the right to change the method of measuring such figures at any time.
5.
==========
Screening Tools
Indeed may make available to you  screening tools for your use during the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments.
Indeed is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine.
By using any screening product, made available to you by Indeed, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.
You are the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate.
==========
You are solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”.
You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law.
While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.
You agree to indemnify Indeed for any and all claims arising out of your use of a Screening Tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar or equivalent law, or that such Screening Tool results in a “disparate impact”.
==========
Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist.
Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application.
To prevent a rejection notice from being sent, you must indicate your interest in the application on Indeed.
Any interactions you have directly with a Job Seeker and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing a Job Seeker directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and will not prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.
If you activate Employer Assist then you must interact with a Job Seeker through a tool provided by Indeed to prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.
If you activate Employer Assist you agree that you are instructing Indeed to send these messages to candidates with whom you do not interact within your chosen time frame, and you agree to indemnify Indeed from any claims arising therefrom.
You further agree that Indeed may notify Job Seekers about the estimated time frame during which they may expect to hear back from you based on the time frame you choose in Employer Assist.
6.
==========
Communication through Indeed
You may receive messages, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or a Job Seeker’s activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site.
In all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them.
For example, if you wish to interview a Job Seeker, it is your responsibility to follow up with the Job Seeker separately to ensure they know about the interview, do not rely on notifications through Indeed.
Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
==========
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
Indeed may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Job Seeker.
Once a Job Seeker has your contact info, you agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which the Employer uses the info.
Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias.
==========
If you send or receive communication on or through the Site, you agree to your communication being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.
Specifically, if you post a Job Listing directly on Indeed, applications are sent only to your Indeed dashboard; any other notifications you may receive are provided solely as a courtesy to you.
For example, you may not receive application email notifications if a Job Seeker has not answered screener questions correctly, although these applications will be sent to your Indeed dashboard.
==========
Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable Indeed Chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify Job Seekers that Indeed Chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer.
For Indeed Chat, you may access or view your messages by visiting your Indeed Chat messages dashboard.
If you do not wish to use Indeed Chat, you may turn it off by visiting your Indeed Chat dashboard.
Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Indeed Chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.

Indeed operates solely as a technical conduit, allowing the transmission of background checks sent by a Third-Party Background Check Service to you.

User Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive.
Once updated by the user, it may take a few days for the change to User Content to be reflected.
==========
For example, the Site hosts Company Pages, which allow User Content to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company who owns the Company Page, including but not limited to the answers to Q&A questions on Company Pages.
Indeed does not endorse and is not responsible for any User Content, including any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained therein.
==========
Some elements of Indeed job search results pages may appear to be content produced by Indeed, but are actually a reproduction of user-generated search queries.
Job Ads or other User Content may be reformatted or include words such as “Powered by Indeed”.
Such content retains its status as User Content despite reformatting or addition of “Powered by Indeed” or a similar phrase.
==========
You acknowledge that by accessing the Site, you may come into contact with content (including User Content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that Indeed shall have no liability with respect to such content.
You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content.
You must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.
==========
You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier.
Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences.
Indeed may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information.
==========
Indeed reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.
Although Indeed has no obligation to do so, Indeed may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), or that Indeed deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate.
Indeed may limit your use of the Site, including but not limited to, your ability to contact other Employers or Job Seekers.
==========
If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please contact Indeed immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal.
You acknowledge and agree that Indeed does not have any obligation to host or remove any User Content, and i) the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy, ii) whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any User Content, and iii) whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post on Indeed, will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed.
==========
You agree that Indeed has no liability to you or anyone else arising from its editorial decisions.
You acknowledge and agree that Indeed is an interactive computer service and does not have any obligation to screen any User Content, or to include any User Content (including without limitation Job Ads) in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any User Content from publication for any or no reason.
==========
Indeed reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.
This means, for example, that Indeed may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.
When you post on Indeed confidentially or otherwise (e.g. anonymous Company Reviews or a confidential Job Ad), your identity may be discoverable by legal request, including, but not limited to, requests from the government or law enforcement.
==========
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Indeed reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers.
Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability.
Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements.
You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.
==========
Please note: Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act provides that: (1) Treatment of publisher or speaker No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
(2) Civil liability No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of- (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or (B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).

==========

If you, through your evaluation or otherwise, provide any Feedback, you hereby grant to Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sublicensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all such Feedback for any purpose without restriction.
You agree that Indeed may disclose any or all Feedback to any third party in any manner, and you agree that Indeed may sublicense any or all Feedback in any form to any third party without restriction.
By providing any Feedback, you agree that your provision of such Feedback is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction, and will not place Indeed under any fiduciary, confidentiality or other obligation, and that we are free to use such Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and free to disclose such Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.
You further acknowledge that, by accepting any Feedback, Indeed does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Indeed, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

If you so register, you agree to (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by our registration form (including your email address) and (b) be responsible for the confidentiality and use of your username and password, and not transfer or resell your use of or access to the Site to any third party.

You are advised to safeguard important data and to not upload confidential information on the Site.
We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to terminate users or to reclaim usernames or URLs.
==========
Indeed encourages you to enable two-factor authentication on your account.
If you do not enable two-factor authentication on your account, please be aware that you are proceeding at your own risk.
==========
If someone obtains unauthorized access of your account, they may have the ability to contact users or take other actions through your account, and Indeed may have only limited ability to remedy such situations.
You agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party sources.
By providing Indeed with a mobile phone number, you confirm that you are the primary user and subscriber to the telephone number entered, and you expressly consent to receiving communication via such mobile number.
If you are a Job Seeker who provided your phone number in connection with your job application, you agree the Employer may contact you at that number.
When you give Indeed a mobile number and consent to receiving communication, such communications are inherent to the services you have signed up for.
==========

However, you may continue to receive texts related to some offerings to which you have subscribed, such as Text2Apply and Hiring Events.
In order to unsubscribe from these, you must respond STOP within the specific text flows of those offerings.
Please note that replying STOP to any text message would unsubscribe you from text messages only, but you may still receive other communications from Indeed.
You may also revoke your consent to receive text messages by terminating the Agreement through closing your Indeed account.
==========
By enabling two step verification, you verify that you are the owner of the phone number you provided.
Revoking consent by replying STOP or terminating the Agreement does not apply to a phone number that an Employer already has that you provided as part of a job application.

Claims of Infringement
U.S. Copyright Infringement.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.
§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
==========
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
==========
Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
Other Claims of Infringement.
For claims of infringement that do not involve a U.S. copyright, please contact us via our Site contact form.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

11.
Severability and Reformation
Each provision of this Agreement is a separately enforceable provision.
If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be or becomes unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary in order for this Agreement to remain in effect in accordance with its terms as modified by such reformation.
The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, and be construed and enforced, as if such provision had not been included, or had been modified as above provided, as the case may be.

Use of Site by Minors
The Site is not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

These beta test products or features may be offered in limited quantities, in limited locations, and for a limited time.
Indeed may discontinue or cancel all or part of a beta product or feature at anytime without prior notice to you.
ANY BETA PRODUCT OR FEATURE IS IN TESTING PHASE AND IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, IS BELIEVED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS, AND A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS BETA TEST IS TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK ON THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE.
YOU ARE ADVISED TO SAFEGUARD IMPORTANT DATA, TO USE CAUTION AND NOT RELY IN ANY WAY ON THE CORRECT FUNCTIONING OR PERFORMANCE OF THE BETA PRODUCT OR FEATURE OR ACCOMPANYING MATERIALS.
==========
If you have been invited to test a beta product or feature, you agree that, unless otherwise specifically provided herein or agreed by Indeed in writing, any beta product or feature and any documentation provided corresponding with a beta product or feature constitute confidential proprietary information of Indeed.
You shall permit only authorized users, who possess rightfully obtained access to any beta product or functionality, access to the beta product or functionality or any corresponding documentation.
You agree not to transfer, copy, disclose, provide or otherwise make available such confidential information in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Indeed.
