Privacy Policy
Last Revised December 17th, 2012:
Myspace LLC (“Myspace” or “we”) operates Myspace.com.
This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by Myspace, including any Myspace-branded URL (the “Myspace Website”), the Myspace instant messaging service, the Myspace application developer service and other features (for example, music and video embedded players), Myspace mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Myspace in connection with the Myspace Website (collectively, the “Myspace Services”).
The Myspace Services are hosted in the United States.
This Privacy Policy describes Myspace’s treatment of information provided or collected on or through the Myspace Services, including our collection, use and sharing of personally identifiable information (“PII”).
The term “PII” refers to information that can be used to contact you or identify you as an individual, such as your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number or credit card number.
PII that Members voluntarily provide to Myspace when they register for the Myspace Services is also referred to as “Registration PII” in this Privacy Policy.
The term “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member.
The Myspace Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.
==========
From time to time Myspace may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Myspace Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting by Myspace on the Myspace Website.
Your continued use of the Myspace Services after Myspace posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
==========
If Myspace materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.
COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF PII AND NON-PII ON MYSPACE
General.
Generally speaking, Myspace only collects PII that you voluntarily choose to submit to us.
For example, we may collect your full name, basic contact information and other similar Registration PII in the event you decide to register as a Member of Myspace.
==========
Likewise, Myspace may request PII from you if choose to participate in certain activities offered through the Myspace Services, such as sweepstakes, contests or surveys.
You may also choose to provide Myspace with PII in order to: request products, services or information from us; sign-up to receive newsletters, notifications or promotional materials; submit content or suggestions for our review; or otherwise interact with Myspace and the Myspace Services.
In addition to PII, Myspace may collect certain anonymous information that does not identify you as an individual (“non-PII”).
Examples of non-PII include general characteristics about the device or Internet browser that you use to access the Myspace Services (e.g., IP address or browser type), aggregate information regarding groups or particular types of Users, Profile Information (as defined below) and de-identified information about preferences or usage patterns on the Myspace Services.
This data may be used for purposes such as: operating, managing and improving the Myspace Services; analyzing usage patterns; providing you with promotional offers, administrative materials and other related content (including customized advertising); and implementing or maintaining security measures.
Myspace Members may also choose to provide or store non-PII information in their profiles, including date of birth, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies), videos and/or pictures, private messages, bulletins or personal statements (collectively “Profile Information”).
==========
The Profile Information in a Member’s profile is provided at his or her sole discretion.
Myspace Members can change their Registration PII and Profile Information at any time and can exercise certain controls over how Visitors, other Members and Myspace communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available within the “Edit Profile” portion of their Myspace profile.

Myspace may collect certain types of non-PII from Users automatically, including through the use tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons.
Cookies are small bits of information that are based on your online activity and stored on the hard drive of your computer by your Internet browser when you interact with the Myspace Services.

Data in cookies may also be read to authenticate user sessions or provide services (including customized advertising).
==========
Third-party advertisements displayed on Myspace Services may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers (known as “third-party cookies”).

However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Myspace Services.
==========
Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) are tiny images that can be inserted in a webpage, e-mail or other communication and used to transfer a User’s unique identifier (often in the form of a cookie) to a database in order to associate that User with previously acquired information about him or her.
They allow entities to gather information such as the number of times that an individual accesses a website, the nature of his or her interaction with that website (e.g., when the website was accessed and how much time was spent browsing a particular area) and whether an individual has received or opened an e-mail.
Myspace may use third-party web beacons in the Myspace Services in order to help manage our customized advertising efforts and to collect non-PII for purposes that are consistent with the disclosures in this Privacy Policy (e.g., to perform statistical analysis and track usage patterns).
These pixel tags are provided by our trusted business partners, such as Google Analytics and SiteMeter.
You can obtain additional information regarding Google Analytics and SiteMeter at www.google-analytics.com and www.sitemeter.com.

NOTICE: MYSPACE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES
When you voluntarily provide PII to Myspace, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Myspace will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
At the time you provide your PII, Myspace will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See “Choice” below).
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Myspace will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given Myspace permission to do so (See “Use” below).
However, please note that we may use and share non-PII in any manner not otherwise prohibited by this Privacy Policy.
==========
Myspace Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.
Myspace Services may also carry advertisements from other companies.
Myspace is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Myspace Services or for the privacy practices of third-party Internet advertising companies.
Once you leave Myspace Services via such a link, access a third-party application (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.
Myspace Services may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Myspace, including Specific Media LLC (collectively, “Affiliated Companies”).
Any sites operated by Affiliated Companies are governed by the relevant privacy policies and practices of such Affiliated Companies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.
We encourage Users who visit Affiliated Company sites to refer to the applicable Affiliated Company’s separate privacy policy to ensure that you understand its privacy practices.
==========
Myspace may use tracking technologies to customize the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile Information you provide to us, including any information you provide in structured profile fields or in multiple choice questions (e.g., “Marital Status,” “Education” or “Children”) (collectively, “Structured Profile Information”) and information you add to open-ended profile fields and essay questions (e.g., “About Me,” “Interests” or “Movies”) (collectively, “Non-Structured Profile Information”).
We may also share such Profile Information and other non-PII about you with our Affiliated Companies for the purposes of customizing the online ads you encounter to those we believe are aligned with your interests.
For example, based on your music interests in your Non-Structured Profile Information, we might display an advertisement to make sure you are advised when your favorite band is coming to town.
Although we do not use or provide your PII to third parties in connection with this feature, you may choose to disable advertising customization based on your Non-Structured Profile Information by logging in and clicking here.
==========
Some of the advertisements that appear on Myspace Services may also be delivered to you by third-party Internet advertising companies.
These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PII about your visit to or use of Myspace Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address.
To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please click here.
Third-party applications (such as widgets) created by third-party developers may also be available on the Myspace Services.
Third-party applications are small bits of software, often with interactivity, that can be installed into Members’ profiles or shared with other Users.
==========
However, Myspace does not control the third party-developers, and cannot dictate their actions.
When a Member engages with a third-party application, that Member is interacting with the third-party developer, not with Myspace.
Myspace encourages Members not to provide PII to the third party’s application unless the Member knows the party with whom it is interacting.
CHOICE: MYSPACE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Myspace will get your permission before we use the PII you provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was submitted or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Myspace.
USE: MYSPACE'S USE OF PII
Myspace will only use the PII you provide under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
If Myspace obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy.
In order to locate other Myspace Members that you may already know in the physical world, Myspace allows Users to search for Members using Registration PII (i.e., full name or email address).
Myspace also allows Users to browse for certain Profile Information in order to help connect with Members (i.e., schools and/or companies where Users may have attended or worked).
Myspace may also enable Members to publicly display some Registration PII as an element of their Profile Information if they choose to do so via a profile setting under “Edit Profile.”
Search engines may index the portion of a Member’s profile (including the Profile Information it contains) that is publicly displayed.
If you have consented to receive promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications from Myspace, Myspace may periodically use your email address to send you such materials related to the Myspace Services, as applicable.
If you want to stop receiving such materials from Myspace, you can change your profile settings under “Account Settings,” or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.
==========
Myspace employees, agents and contractors must have a business reason to obtain access to your PII.
Myspace may disclose PII to our trusted agents and service providers so that they can perform requested services on our behalf (e.g., message board administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, and data processing).
For example, we may disclose PII to outside contractors, agents or sponsors to help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes.
==========
These outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your PII to provide Myspace with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
Myspace may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII.
Myspace also may share your PII with Affiliated Companies if it has a business reason to do so.
As described in “Notice” above, Myspace may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Myspace Website, or may work with outside companies to do so.
==========
Your non-PII and/or Profile Information may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished.
Myspace prohibits these companies from sharing your non-PII and/or Profile Information with any third party or from using it for any other purpose.
Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with Myspace’s advertisers and business partners.
There may be instances when Myspace may access or disclose PII without providing you a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Myspace, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Users of the Myspace Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.
In addition, if Myspace sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Myspace may transfer your PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.
==========
When a Member who is located in the European Union chooses to post Profile Information that will be publicly disclosed, that Member is responsible for ensuring that such information conforms to all local data protection laws.
Myspace is not responsible under the EU local data protection laws for Member-posted information.
All Members expressly acknowledge that information collected by or through the Myspace Services is submitted to Myspace and may be hosted, stored or otherwise processed by us (or by third-party service providers on our behalf) in the United States and/or internationally in countries that may not have received an adequacy determination from the European Commission.
By providing us with information through the Myspace Services, Members specifically consent to the processing of such information in any and all such locations in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Member privacy is important to Myspace, and we are committed to protecting your PII from unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification.
To this end, we have implemented physical, technical and administrative safeguards designed to help safeguard PII in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards.
In addition, Myspace uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
