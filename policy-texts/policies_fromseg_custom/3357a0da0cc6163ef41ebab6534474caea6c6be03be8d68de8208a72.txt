The purpose of this processing is to provide you access to our products and services to which you or your employer have purchased or subscribed.
Trimble Products, Software Services, Apps and Subscription Websites
Trimble offers various services to our customers.
The data processed in the context of these services is processed generally on behalf of our customers (who may be your employer).
When you use these services, Trimble will process the following data:
Usage Details.
==========
When you access our websites or use our apps, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the websites and apps, including location data, logs, back-end information and server calls, communication data, and the resources that you access and use on or through the websites and apps.
The purpose for processing this information is to manage, secure and improve our products and services.

Our servers may receive data from your browser or device when you visit one of our websites or use an app.
That data can include your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located), device ID, operating systems, pages viewed, time spent, the type of browser and device you used, as well as the referring website, and if applicable, the search terms that led you to our website.
We require some of this usage and device information to provide you and our customers with certain functionality of our products, software, services, websites and apps.
If you do not want us to collect or process this usage and device information, do not use our products, software, services, access our websites, or download our app, or delete our app from your device if already downloaded.
==========
Also, we use automated systems to analyze your use of our products, software, services, websites and apps using techniques such as machine learning in order to improve our products, software, services, apps and websites.
This analysis may occur as the content is sent or received using an online feature of a Trimble app or website, or when the content is stored on Trimble servers.
Trimble app activation and automatic updates
When you are registered to use a Trimble product (software or hardware) for which we provide updates to you, we may process information about your Trimble product and any product on which you may have it installed (including your IP address), and your product serial number.
Some of our apps connect to our servers and offer you the ability to install updates to the app, either in the background or upon your confirmation.

We may also use information collected through activation or app updates to validate that you hold a valid license to our product and confirm that it is genuine and properly licensed.
==========
Trimble Emails and Marketing Automation
Trimble uses marketing automation platforms for sending emails.
These platforms and other email clients track behavior related to those emails, including whether you have received or opened the email, opened an attachment or clicked a link in the email, or forwarded the email.
If you do not want us to collect this information from future Trimble marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving Trimble marketing emails using the “Manage Preferences” or “Unsubscribe” link on the bottom of the email you received (either option may apply).
Stored Information and Files
Trimble may use cookies, web beacons or other tracking mechanisms to collect information about how you have used our websites and apps, and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the app or website.
