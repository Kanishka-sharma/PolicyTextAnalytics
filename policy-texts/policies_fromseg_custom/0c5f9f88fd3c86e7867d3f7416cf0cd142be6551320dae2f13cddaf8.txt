For each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the website applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions.
To the extent there is a conflict between those privacy provisions and this policy, the privacy provisions for the specific event will govern.

==========
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY 
NYMag.com respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen (13).
We have developed this site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen (13).
Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen (13).
Upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen (13) has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information, member name and password from our records.
If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law: 
      
To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian; 
To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information; 
To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again; 
To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and 
To protect the security or integrity of the site, take precautions against liability, respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.

Guidelines for Parents 
By taking responsibility for your children's online computer use, parents can greatly minimize any potential risks for being online.
The best way to assure that your children are having positive online experiences is to stay in touch with what they are doing.
One way to do this is to spend time with your children while they are online.
==========
Have them show you what they are doing and ask them to teach you how to access the services.
While children and teenagers need a certain amount of privacy, they also need parental involvement and supervision in their daily lives.
The same general parenting skills that apply to the "real world" also apply while online.
==========
Make it a family rule to: 

Never give out identifying information-home address, school name, or telephone number — in a public message such as chat or bulletin boards, and be sure you're dealing with someone that both you and your child know and trust before giving it out via email.
Think carefully before revealing any personal information such as age, marital status, or financial information.
==========
Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting your child's name if your service allows it.
Get to know the services your child uses.
If you don't know how to log on, get your child to show you.
==========
Find out what types of information it offers, and whether there are ways for parents to block out objectionable material.
Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another computer user without parental permission.
If a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child.
==========
Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable.
Encourage your children to tell you if they encounter such messages.
If you or your child receives a message that is harassing, of a sexual nature, or threatening, forward a copy of the message to your service provider and ask for their assistance.
==========
Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography while online, immediately report this to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678.
You should also notify your online service.
Remember that people online may not be who they seem.
Because you can't see or even hear the person it would be easy for someone to misrepresent him-or herself.
Thus, someone indicating that "she" is a "12 year-old girl" could in reality be a 40-year-old man.
==========
Remember that everything you read online may not be true.
Any offer that's "too good to be true" probably is.
Be very careful about any offers that involve your coming to a meeting or having someone visit your house.
==========
Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children.
Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder.
Remember to monitor their compliance with these rules, especially when it comes to the amount of time your children spend on the computer.
==========
A child or teenager's excessive use of online services or bulletin boards, especially late at night, may be a clue that there is a potential problem.
Remember that personal computers and online services should not be used as electronic babysitters.
==========
Be sure to make this a family activity.
Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than the child's bedroom.
==========
Get to know their "online friends" just as you get to know all of their other friends.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.
