We want to protect your privacy.
In order to operate, our web sites and business operations may gather information about you.
These terms explain how this may happen, what we will do with any potentially private data and how you can get in contact should you have any concerns.
==========
Personally Identifiable Information Collected
Personal identifiable information is information that allows you to be identified as a particular person, such as your name, your address or phone number.
We collect certain types of personal information when you register for an event, a webcast or a newsletter.
This information may include:
your name
your title
your address
your phone number
your fax number
your email address
your credit card number or other payment method
Information we collect such as this will not be given or sold to third parties unless we have specifically obtained your permission beforehand.

Cookies & Web Beacons
Third Door Media, its advertisers or analytics partners may send a cookie to your computer or use web beacons to gather statistical information.
A cookie does not personally identify you.
It is simply a way to know that a particular web browser was used to visit our sites.
A web beacon does not personally identify you.
It is simply a way to automatically send information about pages and content used to an analysis tool.
Cookies and web beacons allows us to understand things such as whether a particular web browser is spending much time on our sites, visiting several times per month and other types of analysis.
If you never provide us with personally identifiable information, then your visits – despite us using cookies or web beacons – are anonymous.
We don’t know the actual person linked with the cookie.
It’s like having a library card but never having to provide your name, address or phone number to check out books.
The books are checked out by someone using a particular library card number, but who owns that number isn’t known.
==========
If you do provide personally identifiable information, then potentially we could link that with your cookie, then gather the visits with web beacons and understand how you personally have acted when visiting our web site.
Advertisers may also use cookies and web beacons to ascertain how many times you’ve seen an advertisement.
No personally identifiable information you give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on our web sites.
Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent.
Privacy software can be used to override web beacons.
Taking either of these actions shouldn’t cause a problem with our sites, should you so choose.
If you do encounter a problem, please let us know.
