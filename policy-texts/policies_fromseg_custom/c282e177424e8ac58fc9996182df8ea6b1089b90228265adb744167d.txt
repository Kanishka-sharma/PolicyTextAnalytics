Submitting a Verifiable Rights Request
The Epoch Times will respond to an individual’s “verifiable request” to exercise his or her rights under the CCPA – that is, where The Epoch Times has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and The Epoch Times has been able to verify the individual’s identity.
The need to verify an individual’s identity is critical to protecting your information, and to ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act on your behalf.
==========
Submitting your request.
You may submit a verifiable request via the contact information listed in the “Contact Us” section below.
==========
We will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process.
This information may include your name, address, whether you have an account with The Epoch Times, and other information deemed necessary by The Epoch Times to reasonably verify your identity.
Once we have your submission, we will compare the information you provided to the information we have about you to verify your identity.
If necessary, we may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity.
==========
We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations where we are unable to confirm that a request for your information is a “verifiable request.”
We will not be able to process your request if we cannot verify your identity.
==========
Submitting a request through an authorized agent.
Under California law a California resident can appoint an “authorized agent” to make certain verifiable requests upon their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the consumer’s information.
An authorized agent may submit a request by following the steps outlined above.
An authorized agent must identify the consumer he or she is submitting a request on behalf of, and provide the information requested by The Epoch Times to verify the consumer’s identity.
The Epoch Times will also require the purported authorized agent to submit proof that he or she has been authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf.
Because the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under California law in such situations.
==========
This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information.
We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without authorization.
We will not share your information or honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.
Exercising your Privacy Rights
As described above, you may have certain rights to access, delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their information.
Once The Epoch Times receives and confirms a verifiable consumer request, we will work to promptly process such request.
The need to verify an individual’s identity is critical to protecting your information, and ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf.
To that end, we must be able to verify your information in order to process your request.
