How we gather information from users

==========
We also gather information you provide when you participate in interactive areas of our site, including sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms, etc.
Also, in connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you may be asked to provide information, including credit card information, necessary to complete a transaction you have requested.
Often, the information we request may be identified as "optional."
==========
Also, you may change or update some of the information you provide to us during chicagotribune.com membership registration by returning to this page, or by pointing your Web browser to http://chicagotribune.com/go/Register.
chicagotribune.com may also employ "cookies" and other technology to improve your navigation through the site and to allow customization of the site according to your individual preferences.
Cookie technology involves a string of information (the cookie) that is passed to your Web browser and stored on your computer.
This cookie then identifies you as a unique user and holds your preferences, as you have identified them, and other information from your visit.
For example, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit and granting you certain access privileges.
Cookies may also be used to control the number of times you encounter particular advertisements while visiting our sites.
For example, while you are on our site, you may see advertisements tailored to things you have shown an interest in.
You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we will not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.
Like most Web sites, chicagotribune.com also logs IP addresses (such as the name of your Internet Service Provider of browser), or the electronic location of your computer on the Internet.

What we do with the information we collect
The information you share with us may be used in several ways.
Typically, during your visit to our sites, we will use your registration and demographic information to deliver targeted editorial or advertising content we think might interest you.
==========
We may also combine information about you, your computer, and your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to create aggregate information about chicagotribune.com users as a whole and to identify their preferences in content and advertising.
This aggregated information does not include any personally identifiable information about you.
==========
Aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners or used by Tribune Interactive, Inc., and other Tribune Company affiliates.
We may also use personally identifiable information to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policies; services and products offered by Tribune Interactive, Inc., and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners; and other topics we think you might find to be of interest.
For example, we may communicate with you from time to time about changes and improvements to chicagotribune.com and about sweepstakes or promotions we are conducting.
We also reserve the right to share your information with other Tribune Interactive Web sites and other Tribune Company business units and affiliates.
In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses.
==========
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
From time to time our advertising and promotional partners may use your registration and other information to call to your attention products and offers they believe might interest you.
If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us any information we might use for this purpose.
If you decline at the time you provide us with information, you will not receive e-mail or other communications sent directly by our advertisers utilizing information collected from our site, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf.
==========
Personal information collected by chicagotribune.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of chicagotribune.com (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may also have access to such information.
