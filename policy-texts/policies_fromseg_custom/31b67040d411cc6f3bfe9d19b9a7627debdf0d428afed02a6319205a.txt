GDPR
Privacy Notice
Effective
Date: August 27, 2020
 
Scope of this Notice: This GDPR privacy notice (the “Notice”)
is included in our Privacy Policy and applies to the ‘personal data,’ as
defined in the GDPR, of natural persons located in the EEA (“EEA Individuals”)
processed by TreSensa.
Except as otherwise defined within this GDPR Privacy
Notice, all terms herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Privacy Policy
or, if not defined herein or in the Privacy Policy, the GDPR.
To
the extent of any conflict between this Notice and the Privacy Policy, this
Notice shall control only with respect to EEA Individuals and their personal
data.
If you are located elsewhere, please see our Privacy Policy here.
Controller Details: TreSensa acts as a data controller of
personal data regarding the following categories of EEA Individuals: (a)
end-users (“End-Users,” “you,” or “your”) who are served
our Playable Ads via a Platform, (b) our business partners, such as our service
providers and prospective/current marketer customers (“Business Contacts”),
and (c) our Website visitors (“Website Visitors”) for the purposes and
under the legal bases described below.
Please note that, in some cases, the
categories of data subjects above may overlap (e.g., Business Contacts using
the Website).

Purposes and Legal Basis of
Processing:



Data Subject


Purpose and Legal Basis




General (applies to all data subjects below)


Information Security: Our web servers will log your IP address and
  other information (e.g., browser information, operating system, request
  date/time, user agent string, referral and exiting URL) in order to maintain
  an audit log of activities performed.
==========
We use this information pursuant to our
  legitimate interests in logging high-level Website and Playable Ad usage,
  combating DDOS or other attacks, and removing or defending against malicious
  users on the Website and Playable Ads.
End-Users


Bidding/Serve Ads: TreSensa relies on the consent given by
  End-Users to the Platform to bid and serve advertisements and, with respect
  to Post-Engagement Data (as such term is defined below), to the customer
  website or app clicked through by End-User from our Playable Ads.
Given how the bidding and use of our Playable
  Ads work, TreSensa does not have a direct presence on such Platforms or
  customer sites and thus is not in a practical position to directly gain such
  consent before our Playable Ads are served to or used by End-Users; thus,
  TreSensa will rely on such Platforms or customer sites to obtain consent on
  its behalf, such as through their use of a consent management platform or
  notice, including those that may list TreSensa as a partner or member of an
  industry-wide consent framework.
Refining Bid Models/Segments/Multi-Variant
  Testing: TreSensa has a
  legitimate interest in refining its bid models, creating End-User segments,
  and doing multi-variant testing (as explained below), as such processing
  activities assist TreSensa in serving the most relevant and enjoyable
  Playable Ad to an End-User.
Business Contacts


Personalized and Automated Direct Marketing: TreSensa has a legitimate interest in
  personally following up with prospective customers that inquire about
  TreSensa’s services and sending direct marketing emails to prospective or
  current customers regarding new or future offerings.
TreSensa limits
  follow-ups to leads that do not display further interest in TreSensa’s
  services and always provides a ‘Manage Email Preferences’ link for automated
  direct marketing emails.
You may always reach out to Privacy@TreSensa.com in cases where you no longer wish to
  receive emails from the TreSensa team personally (or respond directly within
  such email).
Executing Contractual Documentation: TreSensa will process Business Contact Data
  as necessary to perform a contract with such Business Contact or as needed
  during sales negotiations with such Business Contact.
General Business Development: There are multiple ancillary activities that
  TreSensa has a legitimate interest in pursuing when it comes to developing a
  business relationship or ensuring customer satisfaction, such as answering
  inquiries via phone or email or providing customer support.
==========
Website Visitors


Web Audience Measurement: TreSensa uses Google Analytics on its
  Website for its legitimate interest in web audience measurement.
These
  analytics are collected solely on TreSensa’s behalf and is not shared with
  Google.
Information collected by Google Analytics includes static or dynamic
  IP Address (last octet anonymized), geolocation (up to city-level only),
  browser type and language, referring and exit pages (with URLs), pages
  visited and for how long, and other metrics.
Website Visitors can opt-out of
  Google Analytics by clicking here.
==========
What Personal Data is
Collected from End-Users: TreSensa understands that the online advertising ecosystem can
be confusing or opaque.
While all companies operate differently, TreSensa would
like to be transparent in how we collect and use your personal data.
Personal
data collection and use is best explained through the three ‘phases’ below:

Bidding/Ad
     Serving: Many Platforms
     (also referred to as ‘Publishers’) are supported through the serving of
     advertisements to End-Users.
==========
To do so, Platforms put their ad space (“Inventory”)
     on various ad exchanges or networks so that such Inventory can be
     purchased by advertisers.
TreSensa, like many advertisers, uses a
     “Demand-Side Platform” (a “DSP”), which aggregates Inventory from
     multiple networks or exchanges so that we can have access to and manage
     Inventory all from one environment.
In some cases
     we may do direct integrations with Platforms where we purchase Inventory
     without going through an ad exchange or network.
When you log onto or otherwise use a Platform that serves ads,
certain information about your device is sent to advertisers so that they can
determine if they would like to serve you an ad.
==========
This information includes your
advertising ID (e.g., iOS IDFA or Android GAID) (“AdID”), the Platform
you are on, browser type and version, device type (e.g., iPhone 10), carrier,
operating system type and version, geolocation, time, and day of week
(collectively, “Bidstream Data”).
Bidstream Data is not identifiable but
for the collection of your AdID, which is a unique yet resettable identifier
for your device.
This AdID cannot identify you by name;
further, TreSensa does not collect IP address and we only obtain city-level
geolocation information.
Engagement with
     Our Playable Ads: Upon reviewing
     the Bidstream Data, we will bid against other advertisers to serve you a
     Playable Ad if we believe such Playable Ad would be of interest to you.
This process is called real-time bidding, which is a type of programmatic
     advertising, and it happens in fractions of a second.
==========
If we win, we will
     serve you a relevant Playable Ad and drive success for our customers.
When you click on one of our Playable Ads, we will collect
information about your engagement with that Playable Ad.
This information
includes how long you play the Playable Ad, if you click the link to the
application or product we are advertising (called a ‘click-through’) or install
such application, completion of game, what level you completed or score you
obtained (if relevant) within the Playable Ad, and similar data (collectively,
“Engagement Data”).
Again, this Engagement Data is not identifiable but
for the tying of such data with your AdID (which, again, cannot reference you
by name and is resettable by you at any time).
Note that this Engagement Data
is about your interaction with the Playable Ad, rather than any measurement of
your personal characteristics.
==========
Post-Engagement
     Data from Customers: In some cases,
     we may receive information from our customers regarding actions taken by
     you within their app or on their site whether after you’ve clicked through
     from our Playable Ad or otherwise (for example, customers may share if you
     are already an existing client, in which case we can refrain from serving
     you an ad to install their app or sign up for their service) (“Post-Engagement
     Data”).
Such information is obtained and sharable with us pursuant to
     the consent you provide to our customers.
This Post-Engagement Data is not
     identifiable but for the tying of such data with your AdID (which, again,
     cannot reference you by name and is resettable by you at any time).
Note
     that this Post-Engagement Data is about your interaction within our
     customer’s app or site, such as a download of the app, the level of usage
     of the app, or purchase on a retail site, rather than measurement of your
     personal characteristics besides, at most, high-level interest in an app
     or product (see End-User Segments below for more
     information).
Refining Programmatic Bid
Models/Multi-variant Testing: TreSensa collects and uses the Bidstream Data, Engagement Data,
and Post-Engagement Data described above to build and refine our statistical
models to help us bid intelligently on future or returning End-Users on various
Platforms.
==========
For example, we may look at data across End-Users and determine that
End-Users on WiFi engage more with our Playable Ads than those on 3G/LTE or
that certain Platforms lead to more Playable Ad engagement than others.
Further, if we receive Bidstream Data from an End-User that we have seen
before, we can determine how much to bid on such End-User and what Playable Ad
to serve depending on if, and how much, they’ve previously engaged with our
Playable Ads.
We also engage in something we call “multi-variant testing,”
whereby we change variables within the Playable Ad (for example, button
placement, colors/fonts, wording, playable difficulty level, and offers within
the end screen) to see how such variables may support our customers’ main goals
for their Playable Ad campaign.
==========
End-User Segments: As you can imagine, the bidding process for
serving ads is highly automated and, thus, it is helpful to categorize certain
End-Users into ‘segments.’
When End-Users belonging to a segment show up on a
Platform, we adjust our bid for that End-User accordingly and serve them a
Playable Ad most relevant to that End-User.
The data placed within these
segments is purged from the segment within three (3) months of the date it was
first added to the segment (but the underlying End-User data is retained pursuant
to our retention schedule).
==========
Examples of the types of
segments used by TreSensa are lists of:
·  AdIDs of End-Users that engage with the Playable
Ads
·  AdIDs of End-Users that click through to install
a customers’ app or visit a customer’s site
·  AdIDs of End-Users that download the application
promoted on the Playable Ad
·  AdIDs of End-Users that have taken a pre-set
action within the Playable Ad (e.g., shared the Playable Ad, activated a
coupon, played through to a certain point in the Playable Ad, joined a sweepstakes,
answered a survey, etc.)  
·  AdIDs of End-Users that had previously
downloaded an application promoted by a Playable Ad or AdIDs supplied by
customers as part of Post-Engagement Data that enable us to refrain from
showing such End-Users an ad for an application they
have already downloaded
·  AdIDs curated from Bidstream Data based on
visits to certain groupings or collections of Platforms
TreSensa does not segment
End-Users based on personal characteristics besides, at most, high-level
interests.
In other words, TreSensa does not determine, predict, or infer an
End-User’s age group, gender, income level, political leanings, household size,
or similar data points; assuming TreSensa receives the applicable
Post-Engagement Data pursuant to your consent, TreSensa may see that an AdID
made a purchase on a site or app linked from a Playable Ad, thus indicating a
general level of interest in such products, and serve similar Playable Ads to
such AdID.
Even then, we will likely receive an anonymous product value or a
yes/no if you purchased a product on the site or app, rather than the specific
product purchased (though that is also possible, depending on the campaign).
TreSensa’s primary focus is simply the End-User’s interactions with our
Playable Ads, the device information associated with such End-User, and which
Playable Ads drive app installs, product purchases, or other similar End-User actions.
==========
AdID Pseudonymization: As mentioned above, the lynchpin of the
Bidstream Data and Engagement Data described above being ‘personal data’ is
that such data is tied to your AdID, which is a unique identifier for your
device that you can reset at any time.
However, to further respect your
privacy, we will be implementing processes to pseudonymize your AdIDs.
In other
words, when we receive your AdID, we will scramble it so that the identifier we
maintain within our data is not your actual AdID.
This ‘scrambled’ AdID is what
we will use when we carry out our various processing activities (e.g., creating
segments, refining bid models, doing research, etc.).
We will keep your real
AdID in a separate table with limited access to a small group of personnel, in
case you want to effectuate your various rights or we need to match your true
AdID with your scrambled AdID to recognize you and serve you the most relevant
Playable Ad based on your past interaction with us.
We are also working with
our partners to potentially directly receive AdIDs pseudonymously going
forward.
Your Rights: Natural persons have a right to: (i) request
access to, correction and/or erasure of their personal data; (ii) object to
processing of their personal data; (iii) restrict processing of their personal
data; and (iv) request a copy of their personal data, or have a copy thereof
sent to another controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine readable
format under the right of data portability.
==========
These rights may be exercised by
contacting: Privacy@TreSensa.com.
Objecting to Legitimate
Interest/Direct Marketing: Natural persons may object to personal data processed pursuant
to TreSensa’s legitimate interest.
In such case, TreSensa will no longer
process their personal data unless TreSensa demonstrates appropriate overriding
legitimate grounds for the processing or if needed for the establishment,
exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Natural persons also may
object at any time to processing of their personal data for direct marketing
purposes, such as email marketing or use of their data for segments or refining
our bid models.
In such case, their personal data shall no longer be used for
that purpose.
==========
Natural persons will be able to fulfill such rights directly,
such as via the ‘Manage Email Preferences’ link within an email or Opt-Out link
within our Playable Ads, as applicable, but may always reach out to Privacy@TreSensa.com or our address given below.
Please
note that if you opt-out of receiving email marketing from us, we may
still send you important administrative or transactional messages via email,
from which you cannot opt out (unless an applicable retention schedule or right
to erasure request requires deletion of such email address).
Currently, if a
natural person opts-out of use of their data for segments or refining our bid
models, such person will no longer receive Playable Ads from TreSensa.
Right to Lodge a Complaint: In accordance with GDPR Article 77, natural persons also
have the right to lodge a complaint about TreSensa’s processing of their
personal data with a competent supervisory authority, in particular in the
Member State of their habitual residence or place of work, or where an alleged
GDPR infringement took place, as applicable.
Further, as applicable, natural
persons may exercise their third-party beneficiary rights under TreSensa’s
Standard Contractual Clauses.
