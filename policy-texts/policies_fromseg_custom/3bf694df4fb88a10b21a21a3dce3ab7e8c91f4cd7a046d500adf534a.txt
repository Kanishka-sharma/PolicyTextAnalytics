About "Cookies"
While visiting sites within the NIH domain, you may occasionally encounter a Web page that employs "cookies".
A cookie is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk allowing our server to "remember" specific information about your session while you are connected.
Requests to send cookies from NIH Web pages are not designed to collect personal information about you, but only about your browser "session."
The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of these Web pages.
The cookie and the information about your session will be destroyed automatically shortly after you close your browserâ€”it is not permanently stored on your computer.

Unless an NIH web page specifically notifies you, we will not collect and maintain personal information about you.
Many NIH sites are now running customer satisfaction surveys that employ persistent cookies.
Participation in this data collection effort is completely voluntary, and failure to respond will in no way affect the visitor's ability to access information.
This information will be used by NIH solely for the purpose of improving our public Web sites.
