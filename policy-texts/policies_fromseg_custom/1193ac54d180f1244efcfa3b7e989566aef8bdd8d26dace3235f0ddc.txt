What are the Ask Jeeves 'Terms of Service'?
Website Terms 
              and Conditions
              The Ask Jeeves UK website is operated by the Ask Jeeves UK Partnership 
              and any reference to Ask Jeeves, Jeeves or we is a reference to 
              that partnership.
By using the 
              Ask Jeeves UK website and its associated services (Website), 
              you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (Terms).
==========
The Terms may be updated from time to time without notice, so please 
              check back on a regular basis.
Your continued use of the website 
              after Jeeves has updated the Terms constitutes acceptance of the 
              Terms from time to time.
The Website
              The Ask Jeeves Website is a question-answering website for Internet 
              users.
The Website provides standard search engine functionality 
              as well as access to shopping services, email facilities and other

              and services provided on the Website are provided in good faith 
              on an as-is basis.

                for the timeliness, deletion or failure to store any user communications 
                or personalisation and website customisation settings.
Your use of 
              a particular Ask Jeeves service (for example, Jeeves

              specific to that service in addition to these Terms.
Jeeves will 
              post these service-specific terms and conditions on the webpage 
              associated with that service.
All service-specific terms and conditions 
              are incorporated into these Terms.
If there is any inconsistency 
              between service-specific terms and conditions and these Terms, the 
              Terms prevail.

==========
You should read 
              carefully the terms and conditions of use of any third party site 
              before using that site or proceeding with any online or offline 
              transaction with the third party.
Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation 
              in the promotions of, third parties found on or through the Website, 
              including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and 
              any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated 
              with such dealings (including any implied term of merchantability, 
              satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose and any term 
              as to the provision of services to a standard of reasonable care 
              and skill or as to non-infringement of any intellectual property 
              right) are solely between you and such third parties.
Ask Jeeves has 
              developed the Ask 
              Jeeves Editorial Policy and the Ask 
              Jeeves Approved Scheme with the intention of providing you with 
              access to reliable third party sites.
However, Ask Jeeves cannot 
              guarantee that the third party sites accessible from the Website 
              comply with the terms of the Policy or the Scheme.
Notwithstanding anything in the Ask Jeeves Editorial Policy or the 
              Ask Jeeves Approved Scheme, the inclusion of a link to a third party's 
              site does not imply endorsement by Ask Jeeves of the third party, 
              its site, or any goods, services or content featured on or available 
              from that site.
Ask Jeeves will not be liable to you in any circumstances 
              for:


the failure 
                of a third party to comply with the Ask Jeeves Editorial Policy 
                or the Ask Jeeves Approved Scheme;
the failure 
                of a third party site to comply with the Distance Selling Regulations 
                or any other applicable laws or regulations from time to time;
any goods, 
                services or content you acquire through a third party's site; 
                or
any damage, 
                loss, cost or expense arising from the presence of a third party 
                on the Website or your use of a third party's site.
Warranties 
              And Liability Disclaimer

              term of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular 
              purpose and any term as to the provision of services to a standard 
              of reasonable care and skill or as to non-infringement of any intellectual 
              property right.
To the maximum 
              extent permitted by law and except in respect of death or personal 
              injury arising out of Ask Jeeves' negligence, Ask Jeeves will not 
              be liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense of any kind incurred

              the Website and you release Ask Jeeves from all such liability.

              legal costs) incurred in connection with your use of the Website 
              or any breach by you of these Terms or any applicable local laws.
Intellectual

              You acknowledge 
              that intellectual property rights subsist in the Website (including

==========
What 
                  is the Ask Jeeves Privacy Philosophy?
Ask Jeeves 
              UK & Ireland, producer of the Ask Jeeves website, believes that 
              online privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet 
              as a service, commercial and entertainment medium.
We collect personal 
              information from you primarily to make using the Ask Jeeves services 
              easier and more satisfying.
In registering for certain services 
              offered by Ask Jeeves you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail 
              address, post code, gender and information about what you do and 
              don't like.
==========
We request this information from you so that we can 
              provide you with the personalised service necessary to meet Ask 
              Jeeves' goal of humanising the Internet.
However, unless you designate 
              otherwise, the personally identifiable information you provide will 
              be known only to you and to Ask Jeeves.
We will always ask you before 
              providing this information to anyone else.
If others want this information, 
              including your name or your email address, we will provide it only 
              if you give us permission to do so.
From time to time, Ask Jeeves 
              may introduce new products and services to its users.
To the extent 
              these new products and services affect this policy, this policy 
              will be updated and you will be informed of these updates and any 
              privacy conditions related to these services.
What 
                  information does Ask Jeeves gather/track and how is it used?
==========
Information 
              gathered online can generally be categorised as either anonymous 
              or personally identifiable.
Anonymous information is information 
              that cannot be traced back to a specific individual.
For example, 
              Ask Jeeves knows how many questions are asked each day at each of 
              its websites but does not know the names, e-mail addresses or gender 
              of the people asking the questions.
Gathering 
              and Use of Anonymous Information.
==========
Each time a visitor comes to an Ask Jeeves website, we collect some 
              information to improve the overall quality of the online experience, 
              including product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted 
              advertising.
At the Ask Jeeves websites, we collect the visitor's 
              domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from compaq.com 
              or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of 
              the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to an Ask 
              Jeeves website), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape 
              browser on a Macintosh platform).
In addition 
              to collecting these types of information, Ask Jeeves collects aggregate 
              queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising.
We also 
              count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis 
              of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic 
              comes from, how traffic flows within the Ask Jeeves properties, 
              etc.).
==========
To these ends, we may merge information about you into group 
              data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; 
              but Ask Jeeves will not disclose your individual identity or personal 
              data without your permission.
When Ask Jeeves does present aggregated 
              information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify 
              or contact you.
Gathering 
              and Use of Personally Identifiable Information.
==========
When appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive 
              information from third-party organisations in connection with services 
              or events offered by Ask Jeeves.
This option may be made available 
              through Ask Jeeves' registration and/or through registration processes 
              maintained by a participating third party.
In all cases, you will 
              be informed before you register for the event or service that a 
              third party will be receiving the registration information you provide 
              and you will have the option not to participate in any service or 
              event that requires third party involvement.
==========

              Jeeves Cookies.
Ask Jeeves' websites use cookies to track traffic flow and patterns 
              of travel within and through the sites.
Cookies are a standard Internet 
              technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information

Our Web server automatically asks a new user 
              whether his or her browser will agree to accept an Ask Jeeves cookie 
              file.
If a visitor accepts, our Web server will identify the user's 
              cookie for Ask Jeeves' use in internal reporting.
If a user accepts 
              an Ask Jeeves cookie, but would later like to remove it from his 
              or her computer, he or she can just remove it from the browser.
Our Web site uses ad servers (such as DoubleClick) to serve the 
              advertisements that you see on pages of our Web site.
That partner 
              uses cookies to help target ads to you.

==========
With 
                  whom does Ask Jeeves share the information it gathers/tracks?
Demographic 
              Information 
              When we do present information to our advertisers, it is in the 
              form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to survey 
              questions and on-site behavior.
Ask Jeeves will not disclose the 
              contact or demographic information of any individual user to advertisers 
              or any other outside organization without the express permission 
              of the individual.
User Research

              On occasion, Ask Jeeves will make available to potential advertisers 
              and research firms aggregated results from research it has conducted 
              on its user base.
