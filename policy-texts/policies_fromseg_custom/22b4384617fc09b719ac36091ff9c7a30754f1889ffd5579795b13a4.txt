Overview
This Privacy Policy describes the online privacy practices for the www.Excite.com Web site (the "Excite Site").
The Excite Site is owned and operated by IAC Search & Media ("Excite", "we" or "us").
Please read this statement to understand how we will treat the personal information that you give to us.
Our privacy procedures include the following:
We disclose our privacy practices and procedures in this document.
==========
We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes without providing you with a choice to opt out from such disclosure, which you can exercise during registration or by editing your Member Profile at any time.
We prohibit the third parties that we use to store and organize your information from disclosing or using your information without our consent or in violation of this privacy policy.
We allow all users to opt out at any time from receiving e-mail messages and other electronic communications from Excite and third parties including selected Excite partners or from having information shared for marketing purposes with third parties including selected Excite sponsors or business partners.
We allow users to access their profiles and change information, communication and sharing preferences as they deem necessary, by accessing the My profile page.
==========
Excite reserves the right to amend this Policy at its sole discretion and any modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting.
We will announce any such change by posting the revised draft of this Policy on the Site.
You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last Revised On" legend at the top of this page.

==========
What Personally Identifiable Information of yours is collected?
Registration Data
During registration, Excite collects personal information including your name, address, email address, birth date, gender and zip code.
You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time.
However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a personalized start page, a personalized stock portfolio, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes to people who visit our network.
==========
Excite or its third party provider may also collect your credit card information and billing address when you sign up for paying premium services.
In addition to your log-in password, a secure pin number is added for additional protection and security of your credit card information.
This information is further protected by encryption.
Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:
"Anonymous Information" refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual.
==========
For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.
Personally identifiable information or "PII" refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, or postal address.
The amount of personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you.
In our effort to provide personalization and opportunities for prizes and services, we may at times ask you to submit information such as your name or email address, or to share your interests and hobbies with us.
Instances when PII is collected include when you register to receive goods or services from one or more of our partners; when you enter into a contest, sweepstakes or promotion sponsored by Excite and/or one of our partners; when you fill out a user survey; and when you contact customer service.
==========
Other Data
Excite also collects data related to the areas of Excite that you visit and how often you visit those areas.
This includes co-branded sections of Excite that are part of our overall service.
In addition, when you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator(r) or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to Excite every time you access content on one of our sites.
Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access the Excite Site.
All of this information may be collected by Excite and used to help improve our offerings to you.
Such information is only used (1) in aggregate form, for reporting purposes or (2) in connection with your personally identifiable information, to comply with a court order, a subpoena or other legal process.
==========
Cookies and Tracking Pixels
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
As a standard practice, Excite assigns a cookie with an anonymous identifier to each end user.
Excite uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:
Track entries in certain promotions.
==========
Access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customized content.
Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Excite's services.
Display relevant advertising banners based on your interests and activity on Excite.
Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.
Conduct research to improve Excite's content and services.
==========
Require you to re-enter your Excite password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.
Excite does not require users to accept cookies in order to enter or view the Excite Site.
However, if you reject cookies, you may not be able to access certain features.
You can set your browser to reject cookies, or to notify you when Excite or another company sends you a cookie.
If you have questions about how to change your browser's "cookie" settings, please contact the software manufacturer.
Please note that some areas or features of Excite will be significantly slower, or may not function at all, if cookies are disabled.
==========
We use third party service providers to serve ads on the Excite Site.
These third party service providers may collect anonymous information about your interaction with such ads.
For instance, we keep track of whether you click on a particular ad.
This is primarily accomplished through technology, including cookies and action tags, which we place on the pages where the ads are displayed.
Third party advertisers may also use tracking pixels that count new registrations on Excite.
This allows the third party advertising companies to know how many new users have registered with Excite as a result of their advertising for Excite, or to track how many users have viewed a particular advertising offer displayed on Excite.
==========
The information collected by such tracking pixels is used in the aggregate only for reporting purposes, and is not used in connection with your personally identifiable information.
Information Collected by Advertising Networks
Some of the ads that may appear on the Excite Site may be delivered to you by third party web advertising providers.
In the course of delivering an ad to you, these advertising providers may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other Web sites through the use of cookies or similar technology.
This information is used, among other reasons, to deliver tailored ads to you.
==========
When you are on Excite, advertisers and/or our partners may place their own cookies on your computer, even if you remain solely on the Excite Site.
Excite does not allow third party companies to set cookies on our domain, however, such third parties may set cookies on their own Web sites which you may visit from Excite.
Excite does not control the use that these parties make of the information obtained through the cookies they place.
If you have questions or concerns regarding cookies sent to you by companies other than Excite, we encourage you to contact those companies directly.
Third party advertisers may also use tracking pixels that count new registrations on Excite.
This allows the third party advertising companies to know how many new users have registered with Excite as a result of their advertising for Excite, or to track how many users have viewed a particular advertising offer displayed on Excite.
==========
The information collected by such tracking pixels is used in aggregate only for reporting purposes and is not used in connection with your personally identifiable information.
We may also offer you access to software products ("Excite Software Products") which are installed on an individual user's computer, such as the Excite Speedbar.
If you use these products, Excite may collect additional information about you.
For example, you can create bookmarks or personalized links that are accessible through the Excite Speedbar.
Importantly, all Excite Software Products are spyware and adware free.
Excite Software Products do not collect or report information about your activity on Web sites other than the Excite Site.
In addition, Excite Software Products do not present you with ads, such as pop-up or so-called "contextual marketing" while you are on other Web sites.
==========
Excite Software Products include software that allow us to distribute updates and fixes, but such updates will occur only upon prior notice to you, except for the limited case where notice is not possible due to technical problems or an emergency that requires us to update the application in order to maintain existing functionality or to comply with the law.
All such updates shall be governed by and made in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any applicable end user license agreements.
For a complete list of Excite Software Products and more information on how these products work and can be uninstalled, click here.
Children Under the Age of 13
As a matter of policy, Excite does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13 or allow such persons to register.
==========
Refer-a-Friend feature
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Excite Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Excite Site.
Excite does store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
==========
Your friend may contact us at privacy@cs.excite.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
How is the information used?
We use the personal information you supply us, including your registration data, to enhance our services; fulfill your requests for products, programs, or services; personalize your experience and provide you or permit others to provide you with special offers we think you will find valuable.
You may at any time consult and modify your information sharing preferences via the Member Profile page.
==========
We also use other information obtained from user site traffic patterns to better provide you with a personalized experience and special advertising offers and promotions.
We view personalized advertising as beneficial to our users.
Excite uses the information described above to do, among other things, the following:
Personalize and enhance the Excite Site and service such as providing you with your personalized weather, horoscope, and advertisements we believe will be of interest to you.
Send communication about Excite and the Excite Site features, prizes and special offers, unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications.
Send you advertising from third parties including selected and trusted Excite partners, unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications.
Provide your PII to selected 3rd parties unless you have opted not to permit such sharing.
Provide you with advertising and other promotional offers that we believe will be of interest to you.
==========
Contact users for feedback regarding Excite and Excite's partners via email surveys.
We may also use the information we collect to develop summary reports for our advertisers.
An example of a summary report might be "100,000 people clicked on this link and of those people, 35% were registered users above the age of 25."
==========
We provide this information to assist our advertisers in determining how to promote their products.
We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have told us this is acceptable.
Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers, emails or other communications from selected third parties, we also may provide a report to our advertisers which tells them who responded to a particular offer.
For example, we might send you an email, launch a new window within your internet browser, or send you other advertisements in electronic form which offer you a discount on a particular good or service.
If you click on that e-mail or advertisement or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser with the information necessary to provide you with that discount or offer.
==========
Excite may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities.
If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation.
Excite may also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by statute.
Other companies that place advertising on the Excite Site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as described above).
==========
Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information.
As the consumer, you should contact these advertisers or content providers that place information on the Excite Site directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they potentially collect.
Information that you provide while using products such as Excite Message Boards is available for all to see.
Discretion should be used in entering personally identifiable information within such forums, as it may be collected by third parties.
Excite does not actively associate the message content entered by our users in Excite Message Boards with those users' registration information.
==========
Our server computers will retain this information, however; and it is potentially available for distribution to third parties - most obviously law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power, per the terms of this section of our Privacy Policy.
We do not use this information to target any advertising to our users, nor is it ever willingly distributed to any third party, such as an advertiser, except if subpoenaed.
With whom may the information be shared?
Excite may disclose your personally identifiable information to selected and trusted third parties and will at all times provide you with an opportunity to opt out.
If you opt out of sharing your personally identifiable information, we will not disclose such information to any third party, except in special situations described below, such as to comply with the law or administer the Excite Site.
You can elect to opt-out at anytime by updating the preferences in your Member Profile page.
You can also elect not to use certain services or participate in certain promotions if you do not want your information shared with the third parties who are sponsoring or administering such promotions.
==========
In the event that all or substantially all of Excite's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Excite may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity.
If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given a choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
Excite may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process.
Excite may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining Excite.
==========
What happens when you leave Excite to go to other sites?
Excite does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than those Internet domains that are under the control of Excite itself.
When you are on the Excite Site, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.
For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or an Excite Site search result, the "click" may take you off the Excite Site.
These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you.
Excite is not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data, that you may create when using such third party sites.
==========
We also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by Excite and selected companies.
In many cases, these co-branded services will contain Excite Site branding, but may not be hosted by Excite.
You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by", if standard Excite branding is not displayed on the top of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information.
In such cases, if you use the co-branded service, Excite may be entitled to receive information about what you do when using that service.
If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service.
We encourage you to read the privacy polices of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
When you are using a co-branded service, we will attempt to make sure that there is a link to the service provider's applicable privacy policies and terms of service.
==========
What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of personal information?
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Excite Site.
Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a personalized start page, a personalized stock portfolio, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes.
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from Excite or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies.
==========
If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences.
with respect to email or the sharing of information.
If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails.
==========
However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to conduct sweepstakes and promotions, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the Excite Site or comply with applicable law.
We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.
An example of a Service Alert message would be notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be abandoned.
And finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service.
Excite is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters which will be important to you.
These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare.
==========
Children Ages 13-17
We will not share the PII of users who are 13 to 17 years old with any third party - even if that user gave us permission to do so during registration - except in cases where the information is being shared with a nonprofit organization that offers bona fide outreach and support services to children.
In cases where minors have volunteered information in the context of a peer counseling or mentoring environment on the Excite Site, this information will be shared with that nonprofit organization.
As reflected in this Privacy Policy, we will provide PII about our users age 13-17 to law enforcement or judicial authorities upon request and receipt of proper documentation.
Additionally, if we believe that Excite property or an individual's safety or security is at risk, we will provide this information to proper court or law enforcement agencies.
Although Excite will not share the PII of users who are 13-17 years old with any third party, the Excite Site includes co-branded web properties, sponsor pages and links to other sites where you may be offered an opportunity to provide PII directly to a third party.
==========
If you elect to provide such information, we recommend that you review the privacy practices of that party.
For more information on co-branded sites, see the section entitled "What happens when you leave Excite to go to other sites", above.
What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company's control?
Excite operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.
Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.
Even your registration account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers.
Excite takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.
==========
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
Excite will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.
You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of your Excite Member Name and password.
==========
How can you correct any inaccuracies in the information?
Excite believes strongly in providing you with the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to us.
To update the information retained about you, or to deactivate your account, please visit our Excite Member Info.
