Cision and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The EU GDPR came into effect in May 2018 and impacted the way businesses collect and hold data on EU subjects.
The GDPR harmonizes and modernizes all EU countries’ data protection requirements and is designed to improve the way organizations handle personal data.
It is a law aimed at protecting the rights of the EU citizen.
The GDPR defines personal data and reaches to include any company, even those outside the EU, that collects personal information of individuals in the EU.
Our position, obligations and responsibilities are articulated in the data privacy notices and policy, all held on this site.
