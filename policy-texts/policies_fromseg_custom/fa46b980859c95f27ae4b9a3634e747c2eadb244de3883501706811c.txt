McKinsey & Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “McKinsey”, “us” or “we”) understands that your privacy is important to you.
==========
We may process your personal data in our capacity as data controllers.
We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal data, which is any information that is capable of identifying you as an individual person, collected via all websites or apps that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, “the Sites”).
This Privacy Policy describes how we handle and protect your personal data in connection with the Site.
Please see our terms of use for more information about our online terms and policies in general.
==========
Information we collect
McKinsey collects personal data on certain areas of the Sites when you register for or apply for jobs through the McKinsey Recruitment Portal, register for McKinsey newsletters and alerts, participate in our alumni activities through our Alumni Center Website, sign up for conferences and events, and/or participate in public user posting areas (such as bulletin boards, discussion forums and surveys).
The personal data collected may consist of information that you provide, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and background information required to apply for a job.
By registering for McKinsey newsletters or alerts, you agree to receive the correspondence to which you have subscribed at the e-mail address that you provided at registration.
Only McKinsey or its agents will contact you using this e-mail address.
We will send e-mails to this address related to your registration.
==========
We may also automatically collect information about the devices you use to interact with our Sites.
The information we automatically collect may include IP address, device identifier, web browser, and browsing information collected through cookies on our Sites.
We may also automatically collect information about how you use the Sites, such as what you have searched for and viewed on the Sites.
==========
The information automatically collected will be associated with any personal data you have provided.
Use of information
The personal data we collect may be used where McKinsey has a legitimate interest in or other legal basis for processing such information.
In some situations, the collection of personal data may be required for the operation of the Sites or to provide certain services or products.
McKinsey uses your personal data to fulfill your requests for information, process your requests to participate in conferences and events, personalize content that you view or receive on the Sites, evaluate and improve our services, distribute newsletters and alerts to you, recruit and evaluate job applicants, analyze the Sites’ performance and functioning, publish your letters to the editor or comments, prevent fraud, enforce our terms of use, comply with all applicable laws and corporate reporting obligations, enforce McKinsey’s agreements, and accomplish other purposes you may initiate or request.
We may keep any of your personal data on file and use it to contact you.
McKinsey may use first and third party cookies to manage our Sites and our services and collect analytics about how you use them.
==========
Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more details regarding our use of cookies.
Our Sites do not collect personal data about your online activities over time and across third party websites or online services.
Therefore, “do not track” signals transmitted from web browsers do not apply to our Sites, and we do not alter any of our data collection and use practices upon receipt of such a signal.
==========
Use of information collected via mobile devices
In connection with our mobile applications, McKinsey may use third party service providers to analyze non-personally identifiable user activity to fix errors, monitor usage, and improve the performance of the mobile applications.
For example, McKinsey receives reports on some of our mobile applications’ aggregate usage and browsing patterns, including information about the type of device used, articles accessed, and other events occurring within our apps.
McKinsey also receives reports on certain errors occurring within mobile applications.
None of these third party service providers gathers information in a manner intended to identify any particular user personally.
==========
In addition, our McKinsey Insights app offers a personalized list of recommendations (called “Insights for you”) directing you to McKinsey content that we think you'll find interesting.
Recommendations are based solely on what you've viewed in the Insights app.
A unique user identifier that is generated by the app helps personalize your app experience and tracks the articles that you read in the app.
==========
We do not share your viewing history or trends with other users or any third parties (i.e., persons or entities that are not affiliates or third party service providers of McKinsey).
Data recipients and international data transfers
Personal data collected on the Sites may be transferred from time to time to McKinsey subsidiaries and affiliates and their personnel across our global organization, as well as to third party service providers located throughout the world.
Additionally, the Sites may be viewed and hosted by McKinsey and its third party service providers anywhere in the world.
Where required by law, we have put in place legal mechanisms designed to ensure adequate data protection of your personal data that is processed by McKinsey subsidiaries, affiliates, and third party service providers, including the transfer of your personal data to countries other than the one in which you reside.
By using any of the Sites and providing information on any of them, you voluntarily consent to such trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
McKinsey shall not intentionally disclose or transfer (and shall take reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized or accidental disclosure of) your personal data to third parties without your consent, whether for such third parties’ own marketing purposes or otherwise, except as follows.
McKinsey may provide access to your personal data to third party service providers engaged by McKinsey to provide services related to the Sites; provided that such third party service providers will first agree to maintain the strict confidentiality of such information and provide the same level of data security as provided by McKinsey.
We also may share your personal data with third party service providers who perform services and functions on our behalf to support our interactions with you; including, for example, processing recruitment materials, administering surveys or contests, or communicating with you.
These third party service providers are not permitted to use or disclose your personal data except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.
In addition, we may disclose information about you:

If we are required to do so by law or legal process;
To law enforcement authorities or other government officials;
When we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;
If disclosure is necessary to protect the vital interests of a person;
To enforce our terms of use;
To protect our property, services and legal rights;
To prevent fraud against McKinsey, our subsidiaries and affiliates and business partners;
To support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions; or
To comply with any and all applicable laws.
We maintain processes designed to ensure that any processing of personal data by third party service providers is consistent with this Privacy Policy and protects the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of your personal data.
In addition, in the event of a re-organization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, or other transfer or disposition of all or any portion of our business, we may disclose or transfer your personal data.
