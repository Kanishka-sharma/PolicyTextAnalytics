Asana Privacy Policy


Last updated: May 16, 2011.
This Privacy Policy describes Asana’s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the Asana Service.
We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.
==========
Information Collection and Use


Asana uses information we collect to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.
User-Provided Information: You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if you register for a member account with the Service (including by connecting with the Service via a third-party service or by “following,” “becoming a fan,” adding the Asana application, etc., on a third party website or network).
Your name and other information you choose to add to your profile will be available for public viewing on the Service.
==========
We may use your email address to send you Service-related notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail).
We may also use your contact information to send you marketing messages.
If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message.
If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.
==========
You also provide us information in Content you post to the Service.
Your Content and metadata about your Content may be viewed by other users as you may permit through features of the Service.
If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address and automatically send an email invitation.
Asana stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service.
Cookies: When you visit the Service, we may send one or more “cookies” – a small data file – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let Asana help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.
==========
A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
==========
Log Files: When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information sent by your web browser.
These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns.
In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
==========
The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make Asana better for our users.
Third Party Services: Asana uses Google Analytics to help understand use of the Service.
Google Analytics collects the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address.
Google Analytics also receives this information and its use of it is governed by the Google Analytics Privacy Policy.
How We Share Your Information


Personally Identifiable Information: Asana may share your personally identifiable information with other third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you.
If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.
We may also store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Asana (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
==========
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions.
We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
==========
We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as if you choose to sign on to the Service through a third-party service.
We cannot control third parties’ use of your information.
Asana may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Asana’s rights or property.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Asana services.
How We Protect Your Information


Asana uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
==========
For example, we continuously and regularly back up your data to help prevent data loss and aid in data recovery.
We also guard against common web attack vectors, host data in secure SAS 70 audited data centers, and implement firewalls and access restrictions on our servers to secure our network and better protect your information.
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Asana or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
Your lists will normally be visible only to the Users with whom you have shared it, but a dedicated adversary may be able to access them.
In short, Asana currently makes no guarantees about the security of your data, and you should not use the Service for truly sensitive information.
==========
This will change over time, and we will update this section accordingly.
In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Asana will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
Your Choices About Your Information


You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Asana may not be able to provide certain services to you.
You may update or correct your account information at any time by logging in to your account.
==========
Children’s Privacy


Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
Asana does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service.
If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.
==========
Links to Other Web Sites


We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein.
Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies.
==========
Changes to Our Privacy Policy


If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.
Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
