Product Privacy Policy
Sojern, Inc. (“Sojern,” “We,” “Us,” and “Our”) provides advertisements, offers, and other content that we think will be of interest to you.
Earning your trust is important to us—it’s a responsibility we take seriously.
This Product Privacy Policy applies to our targeted advertising services, the information we receive from the websites of our marketing partners (collectively, the “Sites”), or that we may obtain from the use of cookies (as defined below) as you surf the Internet (collectively, our “Services”).
As such, this Product Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of information by us.
The collection of information by our marketing partners and their use and disclosure of such information is subject to their separate individual privacy policies.
When used in this Product Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” or “PII” means your name, home and work address, telephone number, e-mail address, and any other information that identifies you personally.
“Non-personally identifiable information” or “Non-PII” means information that does not identify you personally and is anonymous.
Non-PII may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, and activity on our marketing partners' websites.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is important to the success of our Services and will be collected by both us and our marketing partners.
==========

Any changes we make to the Product Privacy Policy will apply to information we collect from the date we post the revised policy.
If we make any material changes, we will notify you by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.
Sojern adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising promulgated by the Digital Advertising Alliance as well as the principles set forth by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”).

What information does Sojern gather, and how is it used?
==========
When you access the Sites, we receive non-PII about you from our marketing partners and may collect information about your visits, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, pages accessed on the Sites, and the date and time of access.
Through the use of cookies, we may also collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your internet activities.
We may also receive information telling us what site you linked from to get to the Sites.
We use the information we collect to display advertisements, offers, and other content that may be of interest to you.
When receiving information about you from our marketing partners or collecting information from you through the use of Cookies, we do not attempt to collect PII, nor do we deliver advertisements, offers, or other content to you or other consumers based upon PII.
We only collect, analyze, and use non-personally identifiable information for the purposes of providing Services to our marketing partners.
We may work with marketing partners whose privacy policy allows them to share non-personally identifiable information about their customers and/or inquirers, such as demographic data, consumer interests, participation levels, purchase behavior, and/or user-generated content.
As stated above, we do not receive PII from, or provide PII to, our marketing partners.
The non-personally identifiable information which we may receive allows us to analyze and understand more about our marketing partners' customers and what they might be interested in.
This allows us to target and deliver more relevant advertisements, offers, and other content to these customers as they interact with the marketing partner’ website or surf the Internet, benefiting our marketing partner, the customer, and the advertiser or content provider.
We retain information we collect on the Sites for a period of two years, unless otherwise required by law.
After two years we anonymize the data and store it for analytical purposes.
==========
How does Sojern use Cookies?
We use cookies to recognize your preferences and effectively and efficiently administer our Service.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
We use the information we collect to enhance the Services, personalize your experience on the Sites, and provide and keep track of advertisements, offers, and other content we believe are tailored to your interests.
We set our cookies to expire after two years; however, as is the normal practice in our industry the two year expiration date is extended each time the cookie we gave encounters our server.
We do not use cookies to obtain PII.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any PII you submit while on the Sites.
==========
You may elect to refuse or remove cookies by changing the settings within your internet browser; however, doing so may affect your use of some portions of the Services and our partners’ services.

We also use third-party tracking and advertising providers to assist with our Service.
In addition, our advertisers and participating websites may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites.
They may collect and share with us usage information about visits to the Sites.
We also may measure and research the effectiveness of advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during and after your use of the Sites, in order to help us target the ads delivered by the Service, and track use of ads and other links from the Sites.
