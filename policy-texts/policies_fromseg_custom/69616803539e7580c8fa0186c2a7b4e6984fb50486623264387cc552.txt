Privacy for Web Visitors
One can visit our Web sites with privacy.
A Web site visitor can choose to provide customer-specific information by ordering a product or service, sending us e-mail, registering on a company Web site, or entering surveys, contests, or sweepstakes.
==========
Any information provided by a Web site visitor is held strictly confidential within Cingular Wireless, or its authorized agent and will not be sold to any other organization or business, but will be shared as necessary with third-party suppliers, vendors, or agents whose services you use, or from when you make requests or purchases.
Types of Customer Information
On some Web pages users can order products, make requests, or register to receive information.
In such cases the customer may be asked to provide information such as name, home, or other physical address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
==========
Such customer-specific information will be used to fulfill the specific request or purpose for which it was provided.
In addition, such voluntarily provided information may be occasionally used to offer products and services that may be of interest.
==========
Where a credit check is required, the customer may be asked to provide additional information solely for the purpose of performing a credit check, such as date of birth, social security number, and driver's license.
Privacy of Online Personal Information
While Cingular Wireless may use this information to contact or send materials to you for marketing purposes, we will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard the information from unauthorized access.
We will not make customer-specific information that is gathered on our site available to unaffiliated organizations for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of Cingular Wireless, except with the customer's permission, as required by law, for safety reasons, or to survey customer satisfaction, under nondisclosure protection.
==========
We use the information provided when placing an order to complete that order.
We do not share that information with outside parties except as necessary to fulfill the online order (e.g., providing the "ship to" address and other necessary information to our shipper or the vendor).
We may also use that information to offer other products or services of interest.
We do not sell customer information from our Web sites to any outside party.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
Information collected online may be used within Cingular Wireless, or by an authorized agent to inform the user about services and products of potential interest.
Customers might be contacted by telephone, direct mail, interactive messaging/SMS, or e-mail to keep them up-to-date on new products and services offered by Cingular Wireless, or an authorized agent.
Cingular Wireless does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration or contest submission.
Examples of information that Cingular Wireless may collect include: name, address, e-mail address, and wireless number.
This information is used to better understand visitors' use of the Cingular Wireless site and to support related transactions made on the site.
However, this data in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
==========
For example, the majority of visitors to Cingular.com own a wireless phone.
Cingular Wireless may also use e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information to contact visitors who communicate with us.
For example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as receiving our e-mail newsletters or being notified if they have won one of our contests.
A trusted third party may conduct the actual sending of the e-mail offer.
==========
Cingular Wireless requires that these third parties hold the information we provide in strict confidence.
Third parties cannot use the information for any purpose other than the particular offer of goods or services approved by Cingular Wireless.
==========
Visitors will be given a choice when registering whether they would like to be on Cingular Wireless' interactive messaging/SMS or e-mail lists, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such messages from Cingular Wireless.
Opt-Out Policy
If you sign up to receive an e-mail newsletter, each newsletter contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter (due to space limitations, interactive messaging and SMS may not contain such instructions).
If at anytime a visitor chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should unsubscribe using the profile update link within the e-mail, or simply reply to any Cingular Wireless e-mail sent to them and type REMOVE as the subject of their reply.
Interactive messaging and SMS may not accept such replies and you will need to visit the appropriate site to opt out.
==========
Tracking Clicked Links
In order to create a better electronic community, we keep track of patterns of use in the e-mails we send out.
We note which links are clicked in our e-mail communications to tell us what areas are of the most interest to our opt-in recipients.
We may use this information to better personalize the content and promotions that we send you in future mailings.
==========
A "referrer" is the information passed along by a Web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server.
This information is used to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests.
You will not be personally identified from this information.
==========
Subscribers to MEdia Net
Subscribers to MEdia Net will be asked for personal information in the Registration section of our Web site where we collect information to provide you with stock quotes, weather, lottery results, news, etc.
We use this information gathered from you to provide you with personalized information through our MEdia Net Web site and through your wireless handset.
==========
We develop summary, not individual, reports for our advertisers.
An example of a summary report might be "100,000 people clicked on advertisement 'X' today and of those people, 60% had indicated an interest in a specific stock quote."
==========
