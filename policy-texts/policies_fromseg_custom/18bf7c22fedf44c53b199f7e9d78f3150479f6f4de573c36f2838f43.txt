Data privacy
Meetrics provides products to analyze Internet usage for advertisers and publishers.
The intention of Meetrics’ services is to improve web pages and online advertisements.
The data collected is based on individual page visits and indicates if and for how long advertisements and content has become visible during a page visit.
The data collected will not be sold to third parties without any exception.
Meetrics makes use of javascripts or image requests to conduct the analysis of a particular page visit.
For this purpose, the javascript or image request will be added to a web page.
==========
Meetrics’ services meet the strict privacy policies determined by European and German laws.
Meetrics anonymizes the data collected to hinder insights which could reveal private information about the users visiting the web pages analyzed.
Meetrics takes special care that no names, addresses, telephone numbers, or comparable private data are collected and stored.
Meetrics does not store data which can be associated with individuals, without exception.
==========
Servers log ip addresses for technical reasons.
The servers serving the Meetrics scripts log the ip addresses as well, but encrypt and anonymize them by using md5-hash algorithms.
While every logged ip address is deleted immediately, the encoded ip address is used to detect page visits.
By taking these measurements, Meetrics does not store data which can be associated with individuals.
