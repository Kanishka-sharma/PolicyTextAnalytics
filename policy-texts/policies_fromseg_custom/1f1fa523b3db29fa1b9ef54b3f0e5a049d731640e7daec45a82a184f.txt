Your privacy is critically important to us.
This is how we want to be treated, too.
Below is our privacy policy:
OpenDNS operates several websites, including opendns.com, and various DNS services.
It is OpenDNS's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and our DNS services.
==========
Website Visitors & DNS Services Customers
OpenDNS collects non-personally-identifying information including the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
OpenDNS's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OpenDNS's visitors use its website.
From time to time, OpenDNS may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
==========
OpenDNS runs Domain Name System (DNS) services.
DNS translates the name (e.g., www.example.com) you type in into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) and gets you to the place you want to go.
OpenDNS's DNS service collects non-personally-identifying information such as the date and time of each DNS request and the domain name requested.
OpenDNS also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of website visitors and IP addresses from which DNS requests are made.
For its DNS services, OpenDNS is storing IP addresses temporarily to monitor and improve our quality of service.
OpenDNS does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
From time to time, OpenDNS may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its DNS service.
==========
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to OpenDNS's websites choose to interact with OpenDNS in ways that require OpenDNS to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that OpenDNS gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we may ask customers who want to change their DNS preferences to register with a username and email address on the OpenDNS website.
==========
Those who engage in transactions with OpenDNS are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
In each case, OpenDNS collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the customer's interaction with OpenDNS.
OpenDNS does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.
==========
In addition, we may combine non-personally-identifiable information with personally-identifiable information in a manner that enables us to attribute website and DNS service usage to an individual customer's computer or network.
We do so, however, only for our own internal business purposes and will not share such combined data with third parties without your permission.
Aggregated Statistics
OpenDNS may collect statistics which may be comprised of aggregated personally-identifying information about the behavior of visitors to its websites and customers of its DNS services.
For instance, OpenDNS may monitor which domains are most requested by its customers, or how many phishing attempts were blocked by its services.
OpenDNS may display this statistical information publicly or provide it to others.
However, OpenDNS does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
==========
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
OpenDNS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on OpenDNS's behalf or to provide services available at OpenDNS's websites and services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using OpenDNS's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
OpenDNS will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, OpenDNS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, court order, or when OpenDNS believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of OpenDNS, third parties or the public at large.
==========
Communications
If you are a registered member of an OpenDNS website and have supplied your email address, OpenDNS may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with OpenDNS and our products.
We primarily use our corporate blog and website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
If you are a registered member of an OpenDNS website and do not wish to receive such emails, please follow the instructions included in each email sent.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
==========
OpenDNS takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
OpenDNS uses cookies to help OpenDNS identify and track visitors, their usage of OpenDNS website, and their website access preferences.
OpenDNS visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OpenDNS's websites, with the drawback that certain features of OpenDNS's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Privacy Policy Changes
OpenDNS may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in OpenDNS's sole discretion.
OpenDNS encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
If changes are made, notice will be given in the OpenDNS blog at http://blog.opendns.com/.
Your continued use of our sites and services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
