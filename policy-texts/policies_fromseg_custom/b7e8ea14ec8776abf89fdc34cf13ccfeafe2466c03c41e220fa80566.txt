TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT::
Starwood collects information about our guests and visitors to our web sites so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to our guests' and visitors' needs.
Information may be collected as part of: (i) fulfilling reservation or information requests, (ii) purchasing products, (iii) registering for program membership, (iv) submitting a job application, or (v) responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, or reservation confirmations).

PURPOSE FOR COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND DISCLOSURE::
Collection & Use
Starwood is fully committed to providing you with information about the collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII) furnished by, or collected from, visitors while using our web sites, products and services.
It is our practice not to ask you for information unless we need it or intend to use it.
Some of the primary purposes for collecting your PII are as follows:
providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a reservation, fulfilling a request for information, or completing a product order)
marketing and communications with you in relation to the products and services offered by Starwood, our strategic marketing partners, and other trusted third parties
performing market research via surveys to better serve your needs, improve the effectiveness of our web sites, your hotel experience, our various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities
You will always be offered the choice not to submit your PII or to decide what communications you want to receive from us.
==========
However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected.
For example, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations.
Processing and Disclosure
In most cases, the information you provide is added to a local or global database.
==========
In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to transfer your PII to Starwood's affiliates, properties within the Starwood system and/or third party service providers located in the United States and throughout the world for the purposes outlined within this Privacy Statement.
As a general practice, Starwood does not sell, rent, or give physical possession of your PII to unaffiliated third parties outside the Starwood system.
Situations in which Starwood may disclose your information to others include:
when we have received your consent to do so
in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a vacation package)
when companies or services providers that perform business activities on behalf of Starwood require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration or database management services)
when a hotel or other property leaves the Starwood system and access to your PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations
in the event Starwood is merged or acquired by another company
to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law or court order
in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual
If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function.
Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.

CONSENT::
As part of our commitment to keep you informed, we may mail, e-mail, telephone, or contact you by other means to notify you of new Starwood products and services, or upcoming Starwood special offers, events, enhancements, or other relevant information that may be of interest to you.
==========
You may also receive mailings or other communications from carefully selected third parties.
We always offer you the option to decline any or all of these communications by following the directions included in our e-mails or other communications, or by contacting Starwood directly.
If you are a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program member, you may also change your communication choices by updating your e-mail preferences in your individual membership profile.
We would like to keep all of our guests and visitors informed and equally able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Starwood and its strategic marketing partners.
==========
However, if you reside outside of the United States, certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission before we send you information that you have not requested from us.
In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken.
For example, Starwood may collect and use personally identifiable information that you volunteer, or behavioral data or information collected in the aggregate.
In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request.
In certain circumstances, we will seek your express permission when we collect information that is regarded under certain data privacy regulations to be sensitive in nature (e.g., information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or health conditions).

DATA TRANSFERS ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS::
As a global company, we endeavor to provide you with the same outstanding service in New York City, as you would find in Paris or Beijing.
To achieve this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties, offices, data centers, trusted marketing partners, service providers, customer contact centers, and trained associates around the globe.
The nature of our business and our operations require us to transfer your information, including personally identifiable information (PII), to other group companies, properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own.
Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, Starwood will take appropriate steps to ensure that your PII is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement.

ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION::
To ensure that your personally identifiable information (PII) is accurate and up to date, we encourage you to regularly review and update your information as appropriate (e.g., in the event your home or e-mail address changes, or you wish to add an additional method for us to communicate with you).
If you are a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program member, you can review and update your individual membership profile on-line or with the assistance of a Starwood customer service representative.
If you are not a SPG program member you can review and update your PII by contacting our Consumer Affairs Privacy Office and requesting an access form.
Please note that in an effort to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of your PII, you may be asked to provide proof of identity (or other authentication materials) together with the completed access request form.
Access to PII from non-SPG program members cannot be provided by telephone.
If, upon review, you wish to deactivate your SPG program member profile, or update your PII, we will endeavor to do so in a timely manner.
==========
Occasionally, information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems.
In addition, some types of information may be stored indefinitely on "back up" systems or within log files due to technical constraints, or financial or legal requirements.
Therefore, you should not always expect that all of your PII will be completely removed from our databases in response to your request.
==========

SECURITY SAFEGUARDS::
Starwood recognizes the importance of information security, and is constantly reviewing and enhancing our technical, physical, and logical security rules and procedures.
All Starwood owned web sites and servers have security measures in place to help protect your personally identifiable information against loss, misuse, and alteration while under our control.
Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the Internet, we safeguard your information using both procedural and technical safeguards, including password controls, "firewalls" and the use of up to 128-bit encryption based on a Class 3 Digital Certificate issued by VeriSign, Inc.
This allows for the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption method used to help protect your data from interception and hacking while in transit.
