Your Project Posting is User Content (as defined below), and is subject to all the terms and conditions relating to User Content in this Agreement.
It is a breach of this Agreement to post a false or misleading Project or to post false or misleading information in your Project Profile.
Members who post Projects are sometimes referred to in this Agreement as "Content Creators."
==========
Project Fundraising
IndieGoGo may provide you the opportunity to fundraise for your Project by soliciting financial contributions to support the Project from Members ("Contributions").
The rules governing fundraising for your Project (the "Fundraising Rules") are as follows:
1.
The first step in launching a fundraising campaign using the Service is to create a project profile page and post a "Funding Request."
To post a Funding Request, set your goal for the total Contributions you wish to raise during your current campaign ("Campaign Goal") and the date by which you'd like to raise the funds ("Campaign Deadline") on your Project Profile page.
The Campaign Deadline can be between 1 and 120 days out.
(Note, if you reach your campaign goal, you can post a new project to launch a campaign to fund the next phase of your project.
The number of projects you can create is unlimited.)
2.
==========
You will be required to designate the legal entity to which funds will be directed (the "Project Entity").
By providing the name of your Project Entity to IndieGoGo, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the Project Entity with the authority to bind the Project Entity to the terms of this Agreement, that the Project Entity is the legal entity responsible for the Project and accountable for the use of any funds raised for it on IndieGoGo, and that you accept this Agreement on the Project Entity's behalf.
3.
==========
To receive Contributions, your Project Entity must establish an account (a "Funding Account") with the payment processor designated by IndieGoGo at the time you post your Project (the "Processor").
You understand and agree that your Funding Account will be governed by your agreement with the Processor, and that IndieGoGo shall have no liability for your Funding Account or your transactions or interactions with the Processor.
4.
==========
All Contributions made to a Project will be directed to the Project Entity's Funding Account, less a 9% marketplace processing fee retained by IndieGoGo.
All Contributions paid to a Project Entity will constitute "Project Funding," and the IndieGoGo fee and all other Project Funding requirements will apply.
IndieGoGo is not responsible for any error or omission in the Funding Account information you provide.
Unless automated by the Processor, Project Funding less 3rd party processing fees will be disbursed from the Funding Account to the Project Entity's bank account according to the Project's disbursement details (set in the Funding section of the Project Profile).
All necessary fund transfers will be initiated on Friday, and include campaigns that have ended by Thursday at midnight, the day before.
It takes 5-7 business days for the disbursed funds to arrive in your account.
==========
5.
When you reach your Campaign Deadline, your Funding Request will automatically close and no more Contributions will be accepted for your Project.
You may make a new Funding Request any time after the end of your last Funding Request closes.
If you reach your Campaign Goal by your Campaign Deadline, IndieGoGo will pay you a 5% rebate on all funds raised during the campaign.
==========
Payments will be included in a funds transfer that will be initiated on a Friday for campaigns that had ended by Thursday at midnight, the day before.
It takes 5-7 business days for the disbursed funds to arrive in your account.
6.
If your Project receives Project Funding by using IndieGoGo's platform and tools (including without limitation Project Funding paid into your Finding Account), you agree to acknowledge IndieGoGo by including the IndieGoGo logo in the "Special Thanks" section of the credits/acknowledgement section of your completed project as follows: using either the black or white IndieGoGo logo available in the Press section of IndieGoGo.com, the logo should appear on its own line (i.e., no other text or images on the left or right), sized so that the "IndieGoGo" lettering in the logo is at least three times the size of the credits' normal text.
7.
==========
You may offer non-monetary rewards for Contributions ("Perks"), provided that the offering of such Perks is lawful under all applicable laws, including without limitation state and federal securities laws, and otherwise complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Any Project Funding payments may be subject to verification of the identity of you and the Project Entity, the use of funds, and the timeline of the project.
The verification procedure may involve an interview and/or document review if deemed necessary and may vary from time to time in our sole discretion.
You and the Project Entity agree that Project Funding may only be used on behalf of the Project, and that Project Funding will not be used for any other purpose.
You agree that if at any time during while a Funding Request is open or within thirty (30) days of the close of a Funding Request, IndieGoGo makes a good faith determination that the identity of you or the Project Entity or the timeline of the Project are not as identified in the Project Posting, or that the Project Funding has not been used solely on behalf of the Project, you will promptly refund the entire amount of Project Funding from such Funding Request to the Contributors.
We may change the Fundraising Rules at any time upon notice to you.
If you do not accept a change we make to the Fundraising Rules, your sole remedy shall be to terminate your Project Posting.
==========
You shall have full responsibility for applicable taxes for all Project Funding paid to you under this Agreement, and for compliance with all applicable labor and employment requirements with respect to your self-employment, sole proprietorship or other form of business organization, and with respect to your employees and contractors, including state worker's compensation insurance coverage requirements and any U.S. immigration visa requirements.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold IndieGoGo harmless from any liability for, or assessment of, any claims or penalties with respect to such withholding taxes, labor or employment requirements, including any liability for, or assessment of, withholding taxes imposed on IndieGoGo by the relevant taxing authorities with respect to any Project Funding paid to you.
IndieGoGo makes no guarantee regarding the number or amount of Contributions, or the amount of any Project Funding payment to be made to you or the Project Entity under this Agreement.
Contributing to Projects
IndieGoGo may provide you the opportunity to make Contributions to Project Postings on the Service.
You may contribute to any Project with an open Funding Request in any amount you choose.
You may contribute to as many Projects as you like.
It is solely your choice to contribute to a Project.
You understand that making a Contribution to a Project does not give you any rights in or to that Project, including without limitation any ownership, control, or distribution rights, and that the Project Entity shall be free to solicit other funding for the Project, enter into contracts for the Project, allocate rights in or to the Project, and otherwise direct the Project in its sole discretion.
==========
You further understand that nothing in this Agreement or otherwise limits IndieGoGo's right to enter into agreements or business relationships relating to Projects.
IndieGoGo does not guarantee that any Project's Campaign Goal will be met.
Any Perks offered to you are between you and the Project Entity only, and IndieGoGo does not guarantee that Perks will be delivered or satisfactory to you.
IndieGoGo does not warrant the use of any Project Funding or the outcome of any Project.
==========
Contributions to Projects are nonrefundable.
Under certain circumstances IndieGoGo may, but is under no obligation to, seek the refund of Project Funding if the Project Entity misrepresents the Project or misuses the funds.
You acknowledge and agree that all your Contributions are between you, the Project Entity, and the Processor only, and that IndieGoGo is not responsible for Contribution transactions, including without limitation any personal or payment information you provide to the Processor.
IndieGoGo makes no representations regarding the deductibility of any Contribution for tax purposes.
