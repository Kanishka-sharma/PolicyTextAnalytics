Collection of personal information on campus
When you are on our campuses, your personal information is collected in the following ways:
Surveillance cameras
Deakin has installed surveillance cameras across its campuses to:
enhance the safety of staff, students and visitors to the University
protect University property
enable monitoring and analysis of room usage and demand for space
enable monitoring of car parking, including usage and demand.
Surveillance camera recordings are used to enable investigations of incidents on campus and for business purposes such as planning and analytics.
The surveillance camera system may be integrated into the building access system discussed below.
==========
Location tracking
Smartphone technology allows location-based data to be collected.
Depending on the settings on your smartphone, the name of your phone may constitute personal information.
Deakin digital tools may use location-based services to promote special offers and events, and may provide emergency and safety warnings relevant to on-campus locations.
Location-based data is also collected to monitor and analyse traffic patterns, space usage and allocation, and generally to improve the digital and campus experience.
Instructions for how to disable location-based data is provided on the relevant digital tool or your smartphone.

Eduroam and guest wi-fi
Your connection to either eduroam or guest wi-fi (wireless internet access available to staff, students and visitors), automatically generates the following information:
your unique device identifier (e.g. Mac address, IP address)
your location when accessing the wireless network
the date and time you connect to the wireless network
the date and time you disconnect from the wireless network.
Deakin will use this information to assist users having connectivity issues, for planning, quality assurance and analytics purposes.

Building access and security system
Access to University premises and facilities may be restricted, and only specific individuals granted access (usually via a staff or student card).
