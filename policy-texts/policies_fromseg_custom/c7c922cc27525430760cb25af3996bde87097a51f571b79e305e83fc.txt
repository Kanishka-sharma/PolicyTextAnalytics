Consent to Use of Anti-Cheating Software
Our software package - used to access and use the Service - contains certain
features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial
(non-human) intelligence to play on our site.
Use of such 'bot' software
programs violates our 
Terms and
Conditions
, where we deem it detrimental to other players.
==========
By
installing our software and using the Service, you consent to our software
performing the functions described in this section.
Our software may perform
any or all of the following functions in order to detect the use of illicit
automated programs and ensure that we maintain a 'cheat free' environment for
all users: (1) scan your list of active software applications while you are
using the Service; (2) scan your list of active processes while you are using
the service; and (3) scan the files in your PartyGaming site-related program
folders to ensure that only 'non-hacked' versions of our software are being
used.
==========
If any of the foregoing processes reveals a suspect application or
process, our software may scan the files associated with the suspect
application or process and compile a composite mesh (i.e., a profile that
characterizes the files associated with the application or process) to be
matched against profiles for known illicit automated programs.
Our software
will not perform any random search of large portions of your hard drive,
equipment or files, and it will not transmit any information to us or to any
third party other than the information necessary to identify use of illicit
automated programs as described above.
Our software will not alter any files or
information on your computer or other equipment and will not interfere with the
operation of any of your applications.
