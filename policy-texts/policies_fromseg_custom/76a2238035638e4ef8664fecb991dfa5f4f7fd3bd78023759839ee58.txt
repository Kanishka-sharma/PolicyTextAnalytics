INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
We operate in many countries, and we (or our service providers) may move your data and process it outside the country where you live which have different data protection standards to the European Union.
We may, and we may use third-party service providers to, process and store your information in the United States, Canada, Japan, the European Union, and other countries.
When we transfer your personal data to our affiliates outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we make use of standard contractual clauses which have been approved by the European Commission.

We also use standard contractual clauses when we transfer your personal data to third parties outside the EEA or we adopt other means to ensure that adequate safeguards are applied to your personal data, such as a relevant third party’s Privacy Shield certification or binding corporate rules (approved by EU data protection authorities and put in place to protect your personal data) First Data and Master Card have implemented binding corporate rules.
You may obtain a copy of any of the documents we use to protect your personal data when it is transferred outside the EEA by contacting us via email privacy-eu@squareup.com.
