Terms of Service for Blogspot.com


  Blog*Spot is an optional hosting service for Blogger-powered blogs.
If
  the Blog*Spot option is selected, the following terms also apply:


  1.
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS Welcome to Pyra's BlogSpot.
Pyra.com Ltd.
("Pyra") provides the BlogSpot service to you, subject to
  the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated
  by us from time to time without notice to you; provided that, we will
  not alter Section 5 ("Content Submitted to BlogSpot")
  without prior notice to and acceptance by you.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE BlogSpot currently provides users with
  access to web page hosting services, specifically for Blogger-powered
  web pages (the "Service").
(Blogger is a separate service of

BlogSpot is provided simply as a
  convenience for Blogger users who don't already have a place to
  put the Blogger-powered site.)
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any
  new features that augment or enhance the current Service, shall be
  subject to this TOS.
Now, this next part seems really damn obvious,
  but everyone else has it in their TOS's so someone's probably
  gotten sued for not having it.
==========
So: In order to use the Service, you
  must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through
  devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees
  associated with such access.
In addition, you must provide all
  equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web,
  including a computer and modem or other access device.

  legal process served on Pyra; (2) protect and defend the rights or
  property of Pyra; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect
