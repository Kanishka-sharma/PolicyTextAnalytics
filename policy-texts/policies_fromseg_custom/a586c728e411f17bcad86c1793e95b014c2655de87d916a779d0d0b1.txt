Who are we?
==========
We are Global, the Media & Entertainment group (‘We’).
Global is Europe’s largest radio group, home to some of the biggest brands in commercial radio, namely Capital, Heart, LBC, LBC News, Classic FM, Smooth, Capital XTRA, Capital Dance, Radio X and Gold.
==========
Our portfolio also includes our leading outdoor media business, our pop and internet culture website, PopBuzz and our licensed broadcast partners, Communicorp and Quidem.
Global is made up of Global Media Group Services Limited, which is the main data controller for your personal information, and a number of other companies in the Global group which are also registered as data controllers and are listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
==========
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information about you when you interact with our brands, apps and this website.
Our services sometimes link to services or advertisements run by other companies (for example, when you click on an online advertisement on one of our websites).
==========
These take you away from a Global website or brand app, and these companies have their own privacy and cookie policies.
We have no control over the content or privacy practices of those other platforms and the information you give them will follow their policies and rules and not ours.
We advise you to check their privacy policies before providing your information to them.
3.
==========
What personal information do we collect from you?
The information we may collect about you will vary depending on how you interact and engage with us.
It may include the following:
a. General identification and contact information
We may collect and process your name, address, phone number, email address, IP address, user name, password, age, gender and date of birth when you provide them to us, for example, when you:
• register to listen to our radio stations and podcasts via Global Player
• visit our websites
• enter a competition
• sign up for a VIP account
We will combine the information we collect about you so that we can tailor our communications with you, serve you age appropriate content you find relevant and engaging and serve you relevant adverts, if you have given us consent to do so.
You can manage your advertising preferences through our Privacy Manager.
Please visit our FAQs page and refer to our “How Global Player uses your data” section for more detail on what personal information we collect when you register a Global Player account.
b. Financial information
We may collect your name, bank account and sort code, for example, to transfer to you a cash prize you have won in one of our competitions.
==========
c. Device information
We may collect some technical information from your devices (for example, computer, mobile, TV, tablet, speaker or other voice-enabled devices) and web browsers.
This might include the IP address and Device ID attached to your device.
==========
This enables us to serve you personalised adverts, recommend content and understand when you have made repeated visits to our websites and used our services.
We will not collect your Device ID and will anonymise your IP address if you have not consented to the use of them through our Privacy Manager.
==========
d. Usage Information
We may collect information about how you have engaged with our services or programmes, such as the types of articles being read and the stations, programmes and podcasts being listened to.
e. Information if you communicate with any of our stations or website
If you call, text, email or otherwise communicate with us, we may collect your name, location and a brief summary of your contribution or opinion.
We may use your phone number to invite you for further discussion about a topic on one of our shows.
Please note, some of this information may include sensitive information (e.g. political opinion, trade union) when you provide that information to us as set out in section h. below.
==========
f. Location information
When you register a Global Player account, we ask what country you’re in so we can comply with the relevant copyright rules according to the country you are in.
We also ask for your postcode so we can serve you localised content, such as news and weather.
==========
We will only collect information regarding your geographic location based on your full IP address and the GPS of your mobile device, if you have consented through our Privacy Manager.
If you have not consented to the use of your full IP address, our ad serving systems may still make estimations on your general local area when you listen to podcasts in Global Player (for example, the country, town or county you are likely to be in) using your anonymised IP address and serve you podcast adverts based on those estimations.
We will not be able to identify your precise location through an anonymised IP address.
==========
g. Information on your activities outside Global services when you comment on Global
To monitor and understand what people are saying about Global and our brands on social media, we collect information about comments or other information you may have made publicly available about us.
For example, comments made on social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook.
If you use your social media accounts to directly engage us (such as including one of our Twitter handles in a public message or direct messaging us), we may also use your username or Twitter handle in order to correspond with you and to track interactions we have had with our listeners on social media.
==========
h. Sensitive information
We will only collect sensitive personal information (also known as ‘special category personal data’) from you if you provide us with it.
Sensitive personal information includes information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sex life or sexual orientation.
==========
For example, you may provide us your political opinions to discuss on one of our shows or submit other sensitive personal information if you choose to participate in our surveys.
Please do not submit such sensitive information if you do not wish us to process it.
4.
==========
What information do we collect about you from other sources?
We may obtain additional information about you from trusted third parties and public sources:
a. to assist us in our marketing, including Online Behavioural Advertising (“OBA”) (also known as “personalised advertising”), and to ensure that you receive adverts and other information that is relevant to you.
==========
For example, you may have entered a competition or completed a survey or questionnaire on a third party website and agreed that this data may be shared with others parties, including Global.
Alternatively, you may have consented to a third party placing cookies on your device and sharing this information with Global.
We make sure to use reputable third party providers and take steps to ensure that our providers respect your privacy rights.
Information provided to us in this way may include details about your demographics, interests and other classifications such as gender, age bracket, social grade or hobbies according to your browsing interests.
We then use this information to place you in particular groups or segments with other users with similar information (a process known as ‘profiling’ or ‘segmenting’) and may combine this information with other information we hold about you (such as general information, device information and usage information described in section 3 above) or information we have collected when you signed up as a VIP, so that we can deliver advertising that is relevant based on your interests.
For example, if you have been clicking on articles about pop music and listening to our radio stations which play primarily pop music, we may combine this information to learn you have an interest in pop music and, as a result, you may be shown more adverts for live pop music events.
You can manage personalised advertising settings through our Privacy Manager.
b.
==========
If you log in via Facebook or Twitter you will be giving Facebook and Twitter permission to share some of your details with us depending on your privacy settings on their site.
For example, if your Facebook privacy settings are set to allow it, they will provide us with your public profile which includes your name, email address and profile picture.
5.

If you have consented to the placement of non-essential cookies when visiting our websites and using our apps, we will share the personal information we collect via such cookies with third parties such as:
• potential advertisers who want to deliver their adverts to a particular audience and with agencies acting on their behalf.
This will include information about particular segments that we have categorised you in, based on the information we hold about you; and

However, we cannot control the use these advertisers and agencies will make of your personal information once it is received.
