Adobe social networking pages and social sign-on services
You can sign in to some Adobe apps or websites using a social networking account, such as a Facebook account.
Where you give appropriate permissions, we will receive information about you from your social networking account, such as name, location, and basic demographic information.
Adobe has its own pages on many social networking sites (for example, the Adobe® Photoshop® team’s Facebook page).
We will collect information which you have made publicly available on your social networking account, such as name and interests in our products and services, when you interact with our social networking pages.
The social networking sites may provide statistics and insights to Adobe which help us understand the types of actions that people take on our pages.
Where applicable, Adobe and the social media site(s) have entered into an arrangement which determines our respective responsibilities.
You can learn more about Adobe’s practices with respect to social networking pages and account sign-on services here.

In such cases, Adobe is acting only on your instructions in order to facilitate the service requested by you, and you will be responsible for the information shared.
In these instances, we will inform you through in-app notifications or other in-time communications.
