Roku Privacy Policy
Last Updated: August 8, 2018

Roku values the privacy of individuals who use our products and services.
This Privacy Policy describes the information that Roku and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Roku,” “we,” or “us”) collect about consumers ( “you” and “your household”) and how we use and share that information.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Roku on the“Roku Services”, which includes: Roku websites ( “Roku Sites”), Roku’s products and certain other products utilizing Roku’s streaming platform or operating systems (including Roku players, Roku TVs, speakers and other audio-enabled products) (collectively, “Roku Devices”), certain Roku co-branded channels (“Roku Direct Publisher Channels”), Roku’s mobile apps (including the Roku Mobile App), Roku branded channels like the Roku Media Player and The Roku Channel (“Roku’s Channels”), the Roku emails and newsletters, and Roku’s accounts on third-party social networking sites.
The Roku Services enable certain third-party content providers to provide content to you through their own channels ( “Third-Party Channels”), and through Roku co-branded channels like the Roku Direct Publisher Channels.
These channel providers and their analytics and advertising partners may collect information from the Roku Services or from their channels on the Roku Devices, including your device identifier and how you use their channels.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the actions of these third-party channel providers.
For more information about their practices, please consult their privacy policies.

We use analytics services such as Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data on Roku Services.
These analytics services may also collect information regarding your use of third-party websites, apps, online services, and devices.
You can learn about Google’s practices by going to https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ , and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout .

==========
Roku may also share your demographics data and audience segments (e.g. sports fans, sitcom enthusiasts, cord cutters, etc.) with advertising measurement providers.
Some advertising measurement providers act as our service providers and may only use the data they collect for purposes of providing services to Roku.
We may share information that personally identifies you directly with these providers, but if we do, we will not share your viewing data with them.
Other advertising measurement providers use your information to provide services to their other clients, and we will not share information that personally identifies you directly with these providers.
However, if these providers already have your identifiable information (e.g., if you have provided it to them or they have obtained it from a third party), then they may be able to associate that data with the information we provide to them.
Measurement providers use your information to create statistics about what content and advertisements are being watched – for example, to help them and their clients understand the audience viewing the content or advertisements, and to measure the effectiveness of the advertisements.
6.
Corporate Affiliates
We may share some or all of your information with our current or future “affiliates” (which means a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

Consent
Roku also may share personally identifying information with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing of your personally identifying information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes, subject to their separate privacy policies.

Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers
Roku may also share your information with others in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.
9.
As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures
Roku may also share your information to (1) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (2) to protect the rights and property of Roku, our employees, agents, customers, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use, (3) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of Roku, its employees or customers, or any person, or (4) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities.

D. Roku Device and Advertising Identifier Choices
You have the following choices about the Advertising Identifier associated with your Roku Device.
Your choice will only apply to the specific Roku Device from which you made your choice, so if you have more than one Roku Device, you must make these choices in the “Settings” menu of each Roku Device.
If you perform a device factory reset, you will remove this preference and will need to renew your selection.
1.
==========
Reset Advertising Identifier.
You can reset the Advertising Identifier of your Roku Device by choosing “Reset Advertising Identifier” in your Roku Device settings.
When you do so, the original identifier will no longer be used to display personalized advertisements on that Roku Device.
A new identifier will be assigned for that purpose.
2.
==========
Limit Ad Tracking.
If you check “Limited Ad Tracking” on your Roku Device:
· Roku will not use data that it collects from that Roku Device to serve you personalized advertisements.
You will still see advertisements when you use your Roku Device, but they may be less relevant to you.
· Roku will not share ad measurement data and viewing data it collects from streaming channels on that Roku Device with advertising measurement providers, but if you are using a Roku TV and you have enabled the Smart TV experience, your Roku TV will continue to share viewing data collected through your Roku TV’s antenna or TV inputs (including those collected using ACR) with measurement providers.
You can, however, disable the Smart TV experience feature by visiting your Roku TV’s Settings menu.
· Roku will make your Limit Ad Tracking setting available to channel providers, but they may continue to serve you personalized advertisements and share your data with their measurement providers.
You should consult the privacy policies of these channel providers to learn more about your options.
==========
E. Third-Party OTT Device Choices
To opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from Roku on third-party OTT Devices outside of any of Roku’s Channels, click here.
For purposes of this section, third-party OTT Devices are third-party devices that can connect to a TV (or functionality within the TV itself) to facilitate the delivery of Internet-based video content such as Smart TVs, set top boxes, media streaming devices, and gaming consoles.
We associate your opt-out choice with the IP address you are currently using; if you access third-party OTT Devices from a different IP address, you will need to opt out while connected to that different IP address.
==========
F. Choices Regarding “Smart TV Experience” and Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) on Roku TVs
If you do not wish for us to enhance your TV viewing experience using ACR technology to collect viewing information from your Roku TV’s antenna and devices connected to your Roku TV, you can uncheck this option during device setup or de-select “Use Info from TV Inputs” under Settings > Privacy > Smart TV Experience on your Roku TV’s Settings menu.
Your choice will only affect the Roku TV on which you disable the feature.
Your selection will not affect data Roku collects through its streaming service.
If you enable the Smart TV experience and later disable it, Roku will retain the data it collected while the feature was enabled and may still share it with third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
