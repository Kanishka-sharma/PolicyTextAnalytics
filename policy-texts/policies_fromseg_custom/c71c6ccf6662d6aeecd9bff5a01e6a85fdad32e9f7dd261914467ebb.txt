==========
You may send us a request to access the PII that we collect through your use of the Software & Services or through your communications with us, and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of this Privacy Policy.
You may also object to further processing of the PII we hold about you or request that we suspend further processing of such PII.
You may also withdraw your consent to this Privacy Policy and our processing of your PII at any time noting that  such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the withdrawal of your consent.
Please note that any objection, suspension or withdrawal of your consent to our processing of PII may affect our ability to continue to provide you with the Software & Services or address your questions, requests or complaints.
In addition, you may request to receive the PII we hold about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and transmit that PII to any third party you wish.
Where technically feasible, we can also transmit your PII to such third party upon your written request.
In all such cases, we may require that you provide us with additional information to verify your identity and any third party recipients of your PII based on your written request.

We may license and otherwise obtain various information about you, including PII from various other companies, including research companies, data aggregation companies and other third party companies.
Data sets may include information about you or your demographic segment and cross device identifiers associated with the devices that you use.
To the extent the information is PII, we process this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including, amongst others, in relation to the stated purposes of processing (which may include the use of automated decision-making algorithms and processes), data retention, cross border transfers, your rights to the data and the right to lodge complaints.

Information Security.
We implement measures to secure your PII that we collect in order to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information, and unauthorized access or use of information.

==========
Do Not Track.
Do Not Track is a privacy preference that can be configured in certain web browsers (the "DNT Feature"); the DNT Feature, when enabled on a web browser, signals the websites you visit that you do not want certain information about your visit collected.
As the Internet industry is in the process of defining how to interpret signals sent by the DNT Features, Trovi does not currently respond or recognize DNT Feature signals.

If you have any complaints on our processing of your PII or if you believe that we have breached our own privacy policies or applicable law, we encourage you to contact us.
