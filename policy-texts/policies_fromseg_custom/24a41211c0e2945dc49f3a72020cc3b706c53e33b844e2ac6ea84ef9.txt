==========
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
==========
Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Eventbrite) are called "first party cookies".
Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".
Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content and analytics).
==========
The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
Why do we use cookies?
Eventbrite uses first and third party cookies for several reasons.
Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Sites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
==========
Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Sites.
Third parties serve cookies through our Sites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
This is described in more detail below.

What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
Web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or taking an action in relation to our Sites.
We also facilitate our organizers ability to learn more about your interest in their event at their request through the use of these tracking pixels.
==========
In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly.
As a result, declining cookies will impair their functioning.
Does Eventbrite allow for Social Networking Cookies?
Yes, these cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting, or events you might attend, on our Sites through third party social networking and other websites.
These cookies may be used for advertising purposes too by those social networks.
The best way to refuse these cookies is to turn off the social options within your account settings.
==========
What about Flash Cookies or Local Shared Objects?
Our Sites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.
If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.
You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Sites.

==========
This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Sites and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you.
