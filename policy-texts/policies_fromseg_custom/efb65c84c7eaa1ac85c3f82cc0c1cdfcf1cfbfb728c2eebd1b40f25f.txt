Personal Information
"Personal Information," as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.
Personal Information also includes information about an individual's activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Services, location information, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.

We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.
