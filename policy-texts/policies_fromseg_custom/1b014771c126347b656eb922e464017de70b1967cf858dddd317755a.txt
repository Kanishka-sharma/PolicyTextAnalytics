Further information about our use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies and your choices are available in our Cookie Policy.

Special categories of personal data
Some of the categories of data that we collect in connection with the provision of our Services or through the employment application process may constitute special categories of personal data (also known as sensitive personal data).
In particular, we may collect personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical, or political beliefs, sexual orientation, or data concerning health, such as medical history or dietary restrictions, if in connection with our provision of Services or through the employment application process.
We collect this information when you choose to provide it to us or to a service provider such as a travel agent or through the employment application process.
We use this information to provide a service you request, such as medical care on board one of our cruises, (whether in person or through our telehealth services), or special dietary accommodations, or in connection with your application for employment.
If, whilst travelling with us, you allege a personal injury or submit a claim after alleging a personal injury, we may collect personal data concerning the alleged incident, including healthcare information.
==========
Optional facial recognition technology
On participating ships and with your consent, we may use facial comparison technology in order to facilitate and expedite your embarkation and/or disembarkation by taking your photograph and matching it against the photograph we collected from you during embarkation.
When there is a match, you will be able to board the ship or be checked out of your cruise.
==========
Separately, we may securely provide your disembarkation photograph to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), who uses its own facial comparison technology to match the photograph against images of you that CBP already has on file from your passport, other travel documents or prior CBP border inspections.
Once we receive verification of your identity from CBP, we will delete your disembarkation photograph immediately.
We do not retain your facial recognition data beyond the duration of your cruise or use it for any other purpose other than those described above.
==========
If you are a U.S. citizen, CBP will maintain your photograph for no more than 12 hours.
For certain non-U.S. citizens, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will store your photograph for a longer period.
==========
For more information on how CBP uses your biometric data, please visit www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics.
COVID-19 and global health data
For the health and safety of our guests and crew, we may process additional personal data during a pandemic or other global health crises.
At the pier, passengers will undergo COVID-19 testing and provide us with proof of a negative result, will be asked to show proof of vaccination, and will have their temperature taken.
We may also collect such data on board our ships and at our ports of call.
In particular, temperature readings may be collected via thermal imaging cameras located on the gangway.
==========
We will also offer optional COVID-19 testing upon disembarkation.
If we are made aware that an individual is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, we will evaluate our transaction data and photographs taken during your cruise and may run facial recognition technology on our CCTV footage in order to notify the persons who were in close proximity with the affected individual and take appropriate action to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Such steps may include medical examinations, testing, containment and/or disembarkation of the affected persons.
We may use your personal data for the following purposes:

==========
Travel agents may or may not process your information on our behalf.
To the extent you engage with a travel agent that is collecting information for their own use, we recommend you check your travel agent’s privacy policy for details as to how they may process your personal data.
If you booked your cruise through a travel agent and purchase future cruise credits whilst onboard, we may inform your travel agent of the future cruise credits so that they may contact you with reminders to timely use the credits.
==========
Some products, services, excursions, and activities are provided by third parties.
We may share personal data about you with these partners, before, after, or during your cruise in order to improve Services to you.
These companies have their own privacy policies which you should refer to if you choose to use their services.
==========
Where required by law: We may provide certain personal data to governmental and recognised law enforcement agencies as required by law or other third parties where we believe necessary to comply with a legal obligation.
We are required to cooperate with government and law enforcement agencies and public authorities of any country in your itinerary, including customs and immigration and public health and port authorities.
Personal data about you, which may include health data, may be shared with these agencies (such as customs and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) prior to boarding, during your cruise, or after disembarkation for security, immigration or public health purposes.
To protect our rights or the rights of a third party: We may share your personal data to identify, investigate, contact, or bring legal action against an individual who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property or the rights or property of a third person if we believe in good faith that disclosing this personal data is necessary or advisable.

Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to obligate the entity to which we transfer your personal data to use it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
==========
With your family members, friends and groups: When you book within a group or charter, we may share with the group leader certain booking-related personal data about you, such as your contact information so that they may contact you with group activities.
If you make a multi-guest reservation, all of the guests who are part of the reservation will be able to access the booking-related personal data of the other guests on the same reservation.
This means that a guest on your same reservation may be able to (1) complete online check-in for you and others in your reservation; (2) view your boarding pass, and the boarding pass of others in your reservation; (3) pay for a product or activity for you or others in your reservation, using their own onboard expenses account or their own payment methods; and (4) update your contact information.
