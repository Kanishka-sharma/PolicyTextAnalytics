COLLECTION OF INFORMATION 


 

Information is collected from you, our customer, at several different points during your visit(s) to the LiveCareer Site.

==========
If you decide to register with us, you are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, a password, whether you are a student, employed, or in another category, date of birth, gender and country of citizenship.
In addition, we require that you provide other categories of information, such as an area of study that interests you and career interests you have.

You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our Site.
Credit Card informationâ€”While many products and services on our Site are provided free, some require payment from you by credit card.
To the extent we collect credit card information, we do not share that information with any third parties except to the extent necessary to complete a transaction.
We also do not store complete credit card information (meaning we do not store your entire credit card number) unless you ask us to in connection with a subscription-based product.
All credit card information is removed from our systems at your request.
We also use a third party payment service to process your credit card transactions and any information you provide through that third party payment service will be subject to its privacy policy.
PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT GOVERN INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE THIRD PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE.
==========
Passive Collection of Information--In addition to the information which you actively provide to LiveCareer by, for example, completing the registration form, LiveCareer collects information about how you interact with our Site.

USE OF INFORMATION


 

   The information which you supply to LiveCareer enables us to provide the assessment, salary data, resume tools and other tools which you select by matching the information you provide to our database of occupations, educational opportunities and other resources, including data provided by others who have visited our Site.
Your information may be used in various ways, including:
    
      (i)	For some tests/tools, the information you provide is aggregated with information from other Customers to create a comparative database that allows LiveCareer to produce results and reports for you.
When your information or the information of other Customers is used in this way, it is aggregated and is not used or disclosed in a way that allows third parties (including other Customers) to identify any individual user.
==========
(ii)	LiveCareer uses your information in order to customize our Site to your interests and enhance your overall experience on our Site.
LiveCareer tries to recognize you using various methods, including having you log in with your e-mail address and your password.
Once LiveCareer recognizes you, pages, advertisements and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most.
(iii)	In addition, as described above, LiveCareer utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our Site.
This passive information may be combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience on our Site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners and others who may be interested in learning about the type of information LiveCareer collects.
This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.
Contacting You by E-Mail--LiveCareer may use your contact information periodically in order to send you e-mail regarding updates at the LiveCareer Site, such as new LiveCareer opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you.
The frequency of these messages will vary depending upon your profile, including the types of career resources and other activities that you have indicated an interest in.
In addition, we may send you free informational newsletters or notices relating to topics which may be of special interest to you, including career planning tools, financial aid, admissions tips, job opportunities and job advice.

SHARING OF INFORMATION


 


   LiveCareer will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Most importantly, LiveCareer wants you to know that any information you provide outside of our registration process in connection with our products as well as information you provide while developing your resume, will not be shared with third parties, except as noted herein,  unless you affirmatively direct LiveCareer to do so.
With respect to information you provide during our registration process, LiveCareer gives you the option not to receive electronic communications from LiveCareer and third parties.
If you do not opt-out, personal information about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to LiveCareer) may be shared with colleges, universities, potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental or license) and other organizations.
These selected third parties may use your personal information to provide you with promotional materials about goods and services offered by them.
Third parties to whom the personal identifying information is rented and/or licensed will be encouraged to target their offers carefully.
When LiveCareer shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information.
Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your personal information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners.
This aggregate information does not contain personal information which can identify any individual user.
==========
Of course, you may provide information in connection with specific offers.
LiveCareer does not use such information, to the extent it is different from the information you provided during our registration process.
Any information you provide in connection with a specific offer is shared only with the entity making the offer and only after you affirmatively indicate you want the information submitted to that third party.
Third Party Service Providers--From time to time, LiveCareer may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to LiveCareer's users or career management services or job search services.
If we use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services.
These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by you or LiveCareer.
The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our Site, which are governed by a more specific provision (Links to Other Sites) below.
We may allow third parties to use cookies or web beacons to collect information about you in connection with providing you information about products and services that might be of interest to you.
These authorized third parties do not store or retain any personally identifiable information about you.
Consumers who no longer wish to receive tailored advertisements from such third parties can click here.
==========
In addition, turning off your browser's cookies will prevent web beacons and cookies from being placed on your computer, however, you may also not be able to use all the interactive features of our site/emails if cookies are disabled.
LiveCareer provides functionality on the Site that allows you to share information, for example, by creating an electronic profile, creating your own web page, posting certain information and materials such as your resume and distributing your resume, including via email.
If you choose to make your profile, assessment results, reports or resume visible to others, including through blogs, forums, message boards, etc.
