These customers agree to  participate in periodic surveys about their usage of products produced by The  Ledger, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase  behavior.
==========
Panel members are primarily contacted via e-mail, but may  occasionally be contacted by telephone or postal mail.
All survey data is  reported/used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable  information is released.
As a panel member, we require that you supply us with  your e-mail address only; name, home address and telephone number are optional.
==========
Online surveys: Our  websites may collect additional personal information from members in connection with  optional reader surveys and market research activities.
Information that you  provide in answer to optional reader survey or market research questions may be  shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we  notify you otherwise on the survey Web page at the time of collection.
Reader Advisory Panel: Our reader advisory panel enables participants to share their views on topical issues upon request  from the Ledger newsroom.
Participants receive occasional email  requesting your input, and may on rare occasions be telephoned.
Signup  information will be used by our newsroom editors solely for selecting  participants when sending out calls for participation; responses you provide in  answer to requests for comments may be published in the newspaper and online  along with your name and photo.
Reader panel information may otherwise be  shared, but only in the aggregate, with other departments at The Ledger.
Information specific to the reader panel (such as  political affiliation and race) not collected as part of the regular theledger.com registration process will not be shared with  partners or advertisers.
==========
Cookies: Our websites employ cookies to  recognize you and your access privileges on [theledger.com, ledgerjobs.com, ledgerautos.com, ledgerrealestate.com], as well as to track  site usage.
For detailed information about our use of cookies see our  Frequently Asked Questions about Cookies.
Advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising  companies to serve ads onto our websites.
In the course of serving these  advertisements, the third party advertisers may place or recognize a unique  "cookie" on your browser.
We do not have access to these cookies or  any information that they may contain.
We also reserve the right to place a The Ledger cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your  browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a  series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a  particular ad or visited a particular Web page.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web  Beacons/Web Bugs): Third party advertisers may also use a software technology called clear gifs  (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on  our site.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies.
Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about  the online movements of Web users.
For instance, advertisers may place a clear  gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the  same service.
The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear  gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the  period at the end of this sentence.
Please keep in mind that we do not have  access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional  information they may be tied to by the advertiser.
==========
Usage Data: Our websites have currently  contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally  identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors.
We use  this information to track the site's traffic, usability, performance, and  effectiveness.
All data collected by Omniture on behalf of our websites is  owned and used by NYTRMG.
We reserve the right to publish non-personally  identifiable, summary information regarding our online visitors for promotional  purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.
Please note that  this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of  our visitors and customers in aggregate.
==========
Omniture uses cookies to help track  visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of our websites, which will be  listed under the domain nytrlakeland.112.2o7.net.

We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us  with usage data.
IP Addresses: Our websites log IP addresses, or  the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and  troubleshooting purposes.
We use IP address logs in an aggregate fashion to  track access to our site (by domain type, for example), but we do not use IP  address logs to track your session or your behavior on our site.
Log Files: Log data is only used in  aggregate to analyze usage of our websites.
What do we do with  the information we gather/track?
==========
Site Login: Your e-mail address acts as your member login, and  together with the password that you create during the registration process your  e-mail address allows you to access many of the features and services available  on our websites.
Theledger.com, ledgerjobs.com, ledgermarketplace.com,  ledgerautos.com, ledgerrealestate.com and The Ledger will share your e-mail address and  password with each other in order to allow you to use the same login and  password on each of the sites, whenever possible.
This means that you will be  able to move back and forth on our websites without having to create a new  membership account or remember a separate password for each site.
Statistical Analysis and  Banner Advertising: Our websites may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to  measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development  purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or  "clicked" their advertising banners.
In both statistical analyses and banner advertisement  targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate  form.
==========
E-Mail Newsletters: During the registration process,  you will have the opportunity to choose to receive periodic e-mails.

==========
Direct Mail Services: The Ledger offers direct mail marketing services to its advertisers and employs  direct mail marketing for subscription promotions.
The Ledger may combine Web  registration data with newspaper subscriber data and marketing database  information we purchase to create lists for targeted postal mail  campaigns.
Doing so means that you receive offers and advertising  that are most likely to interest you, and advertisers send their messages  to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both your experience  and the effectiveness of the mail campaigns.
==========
Targeted mailing lists may be  shared with other departments at The Ledger and with  marketing staff at NYTRMG, of which The Ledger is a part and which coordinates  mailing efforts for The Ledger.
We  share demographic information about our audience in aggregate form with direct  mail advertisers.
We never share or sell personally identifiable information or  our mailing lists.
==========
Programs From Our  Partners: During the registration process, new users who select to register for certain  featured offers from our partners will begin receiving e-mail from these  companies.
You will only receive e-mail messages from these companies if you  elect this opt-in service.
If you elect to opt-out of an e-mail from a partner,  you must do so through that partner directly.
==========

==========
With whom do we  share the information we gather/track?

We do, however, share information about our audience  in aggregate form.
Credit card, billing and financial information is never  disclosed, except as needed to process the transaction, under strict  confidentiality requirements.

==========
If you are a print subscriber to The Ledger, or  have registered at theledger.com, then The Ledger may opt to share your  e-mail address and other personally identifiable information with a third party  service provider that sends e-mail on behalf of the newspaper.
Any third party  service provider will not share your e-mail address or personally identifiable  information with any other company and will only send you e-mail on behalf of  the newspaper.
