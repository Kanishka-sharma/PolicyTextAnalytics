Privacy Policy
Thanks for using Airtable.
Our goal is to empower individuals and organizations to structure and organize data.
As such, we take very seriously the respect and protection of your privacy and security.
==========
We are committed to following and continuously evolving best practices to support this principle.
We – meaning Formagrid, Inc., doing business as Airtable (also "Airtable," "we," "our," or "us") – prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand our practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of information we collect from you through Airtable’s web or mobile applications (the "Airtable Products"), our websites that link to this Privacy Policy, and any other services we provide to our customers or end users (collectively with the Airtable Products, the "Services").
By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.
Effective date: January 1, 2020.
Last Updated: December 30, 2019

==========
What Information We Collect
What types of information we collect from you depends on how you use the Services, what Services you use, and what information you choose to provide or make available to us.
We collect information from you when you:
Create or register an account, and when you administer your account
Input information or data into any of our Services, or post or upload Content to our Services
Submit questions, requests, other communications to us via forms, email, or other communication media
Contact us for customer support or technical support
Visit any of our websites or download any of our apps
Participate in any promotions, demonstrations, contests, surveys, or other marketing events
Interact with other Airtable users and guests on our community forums
Integrate third-party products and services with your Airtable account
Customer Information
Information related to the creation of accounts or that otherwise identifies you as a customer or end user of Airtable is what we call "Customer Information."
Customer Information may include certain "personal information", such as your name, email address, gender, postal address and phone number.
It also may include payment information, such as payment method, credit card information, and any contact information (such as name and postal address) associated with payment billing information.
==========
If you are an end user using the Services through an account created on your behalf by an Airtable customer (such as an employer, organization of which you are a member, or another individual), we may collect and process Customer Information about you on behalf of the Airtable customer with whom your use of the Services is associated.
When you create an account with Airtable, we may collect certain Customer Information directly from you or, if you create your account using a third-party service (such as Google or a single sign-on service such as Okta), we may collect Customer Information about you from the third-party service (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service).
By choosing to create an account using a third-party service, you authorize us to collect Customer Information necessary to authenticate your account with the third-party service provider.
==========
Certain aspects of the Services allow you to link or integrate third-party products and services to enable certain features and functionalities with the Services.
For example, you can connect your Google Drive account so as to generate Content in Airtable from information and data contained in your Google Drive or integrate with third-party services using Blocks.
If you choose to use these features or functionalities, you may be asked to create an account with a third-party service provider or link your existing account with that service provider (and, by doing so, agree to the privacy policy and/or terms and conditions of that third-party).
==========
You may also be asked to authorize Airtable to collect information from the third-party service provider on your behalf.
We will then collect information (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service) from you and/or that third-party service provider as necessary to enable the Services to access your data and content stored with that third-party service provider.
Once the authentication is complete, we have the ability to access information you provided to us or was otherwise collected by the third-party service in accordance with the privacy practices of that third-party service.
We will store the information and data we collect and associate it with your Airtable account, and we will only use that information and data to enable the integration of the Services with the third-party service provider and to perform actions requested or initiated by you, or that are reasonably necessary to carry out instructions provided by you.
==========
Content
One of the core aspects of the Airtable Products (and our related Services) is that you can upload any information, data, content, material – anything.
We call anything you upload through the Airtable Products "Content."
You (and anyone who can interact with your use of the Airtable Products) ultimately controls the nature of the Content, and our collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to Content are separate from those with respect to other sorts of information we collect, including Customer Information.
As explained in detail above, we may also upload Content automatically with your authorization from third-party service providers (such as from your Google Drive).
Information collected automatically through your use of the Services
We collect information about how you use the Services and your actions on the Services, including IP addresses, what software and hardware you use (such as browser types, operating systems, ISPs, platform type, device type, mobile device identifiers such as make and model, mobile carrier), pages or features of Airtable used and associated dates and time stamps, search terms, links you click, whether you open messages sent to your account, and other statistics related to your usage of the Services.
We may also use tools, including third-party tools, to collect analytics data.
==========
Some of this information is collected through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, session replay scripts, and similar technologies ("tracking technologies").
We may also work with third party partners to employ tracking technologies.
We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies to automatically collect information through the Services.
Our uses of these tracking technologies fall into the following general categories:
Operationally Necessary.
==========
This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functionality;
Performance Related.
We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use the Services;
Functionality Related.
We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services.
==========
This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;
Advertising or Targeting Related.
We may use first party or third-party Technologies to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third party sites.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies or otherwise wish to disable our use of tracking technologies, please see "Managing Your Information," below.
Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Services, as some features may not work properly.
==========
Location information
In some cases, we may collect limited location information.
For example, we may use Google Analytics to convert your IP address into a rough geolocation to understand in what areas our users are located and to improve and personalize Airtable (for example, to display time data in the correct local time).
For more information about Google Analytics, please visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
==========
Aggregated and de-identified information
We may collect information by aggregating and de-identifying other information.
The aggregation and de-identification process prevents the information from being reassociated or identified with any one customer account, user, or individual.
We may use aggregated and de-identified information for a wide variety of statistical and analytical purposes.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we will not use or access your Content except in the following cases: for providing the Services to you; where you (or, if you are an end user, the Airtable customer through which you have an account) explicitly approve access (e.g., during a customer support inquiry); where compelled to do so in response to lawful requests by law enforcement or government regulators; where necessary to ensure the stability and security of the Services and our systems (e.g., where we have reason to believe specific Content is degrading server stability); and where necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of you, us, or others.

With third-party service providers who enable certain features or functionalities of the Services that you’ve requested (for example, by installing applications in Airtable using the Blocks feature).
With vendors we engage to help us with marketing and email campaigns, to advertise, gain insights, and perform analytics into how the Services are used and how they might be improved (for example, we may share Customer Information with various social media platforms to engage in custom audience advertising or use third-party data enrichment services to match Customer Information or other personal information we collect with publicly available database information in order to communicate more effectively with you).

==========
How we secure your information
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and store.
Unfortunately, no security measures are 100% foolproof, and as such no network or system (including ours) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to information we collect and store.
