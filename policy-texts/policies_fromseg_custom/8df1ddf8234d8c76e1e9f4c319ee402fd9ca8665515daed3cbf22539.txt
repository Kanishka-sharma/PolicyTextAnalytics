Bottom line: We know that almost no one reads those 10 page TOS guidelines, so we'll make this short and sweet...
You're free to put up anything with a genuine purpose.
(Generally something that your grandmother would accept or like.)
==========
Other than that, you are **PROHIBITED** from putting any content that's related to the following: (Should any of these be violated,  our staff and automated scripts will FIND AND REMOVE THEM INSTANTLY and your account will be permanently deleted  and I.P. address banned from 110mb network. )
Applies to all members, no matter what plan you're on... 



Phishing of any company, especially MySpace, eBay, PayPal and other banks.
==========
Using your domain to spam other sites.
(Do you like getting spam?
Nope.
Does the next person you're targeting?
Nope.
Does your mom and dad like getting spam?
Nope.
Will you pay serious legal consequences if you do it with 110mb?
==========
Yes!
Will you be tracked and prosecuted?
==========
Without a question.
We already tracked your real IP address even if it was faked by Proxy services.
==========
This will be used to prosecute you and have your ISP shut down your internet connection permanently if you spam.)
Violence, racial intolerance, or advocate against any individual, group, or organization.
Content that promotes illegal activity or infringes on the legal rights of others.
Sales or promotion of beer or hard alcohol, tobacco or drugs.
This especially includes pharmaceutical medicines and stimulators like Viagra and Cialis.
==========
Hosting Torrent Scripts (where torrents are downloaded to our server, and you later on download from the server), like TorrentFlux.
Child porn (This is UNrelated to adult material, which is allowed.
Child porn sites will be deleted instantly).
Having incorrect name or address filed on your account.
Eg.
==========
A name like "Aaadfdf Ffdfsf" or address like "44444444 Greg Rd".
This will instantly tell us that you have not read our TOS, hence the account will be deleted.
==========
Free hosting members have 2 additional restrictions... 



You are NOT allowed to upload file sizes more then 10MB.
This is 10240KB per file.
If a file is by +-1MB out of this range, the entire account will be deleted because it'll clearly tells us that you have not read our TOS.
==========
You are FORBIDDEN from changing the default 404 Page.
In your public_html/ folder, you will see a file 404.
shtml.
==========
DO NOT change it in any way as it's one way that 110mb is supported via free accounts.
Furthermore, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES can you promote your new domain by SPAMMING it to those typical million names email lists.
You don't like SPAM and neither does the next person the spammer is targeting.
110MB.
