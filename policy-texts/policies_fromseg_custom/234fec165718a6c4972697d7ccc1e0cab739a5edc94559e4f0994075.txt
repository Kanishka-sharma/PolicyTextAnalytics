INFORMATION WE COLLECT

 
When you use our Services, we collect the following types of information.
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US
 
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number.
This is the only information you have to provide to create an account with us.
You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services.
==========
You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking accounts, or using the contact list on your mobile device.
We do not store your contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends.
If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message.
==========
PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION
Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties.
If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code.
This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number.
For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information.
You can remove the token from your account using your account settings.
==========
We do not store your transaction history.
If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
We do not store this payment information.
We store your shipping address to fulfill your order.
Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.

LIVE COACHING SERVICES
Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”).
Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers.
If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach.
