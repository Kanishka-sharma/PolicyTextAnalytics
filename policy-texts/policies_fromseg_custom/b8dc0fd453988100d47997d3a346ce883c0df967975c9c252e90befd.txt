Our Privacy Vow
Our goal at Lycos is to be "Your Personal Internet Guide" by providing you with the information and services that are most relevant to you.
==========
To achieve this goal, we need to collect information to understand what differentiates you from each of our millions of other unique users.
We collect this information in two ways.
Registration
First, you may provide us with certain information such as your name, e-mail address and postal addresses when registering for certain services such as My Lycos, Chat, E-mail, and contests/promotions.
This information is used for purposes such as personalization and verification.
==========
Cookies
Second, we may track your visit to our site by giving you a "cookie" when you enter.
Cookies are pieces of information that Web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Lycos uses cookies to make visiting our site and our partner sites, such as PlanetAll, easier.
Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you won't have to re-enter them the next time you visit.
For example, when you register with Lycos, you will be automatically registered with PlanetAll as well, and retain the same username and password for both sites.
==========
Cookies also help us track user trends and patterns.
Cookies also help us collect anonymous click stream data for tracking user trends and patterns.
In addition, third party advertising networks may issue cookies when serving advertisements.
==========
The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you'll find them used on most major Web sites.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies.
You should understand that areas of certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.
==========
Use of Information
Any information you provide to Lycos when registering for My Lycos or on Message Boards is maintained and accessible only by Lycos and the Lycos Network of sites.
Lycos may use this information to offer you the opportunity to receive Lycos notices regarding other Lycos products or services and to further personalize your Lycos experience.
Information submitted in connection with Lycos E-mail, Chat, Games or Clubs is shared with the providers of those services (iName for email, eShare for chat, Playsite for Games, and Valent for Clubs).
These providers are not authorized to use any shared information other than to send you notices regarding updates to the services, and Lycos uses the information only to offer you the opportunity to receive Lycos notices regarding other Lycos products or services and to further personalize your Lycos experience.
==========
We may use only the anonymous click stream data to help our advertisers deliver better targeted advertisements.
Lycos will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
Sharing of Information
The individually identifiable information that you provide will be used extensively within the Lycos Network (which consists of Tripod homepages, E-mail by iName and Chat by eShare) to provide a personalized experience to you.
For example, we may share this information with Tripod, a Lycos company, in order for you to receive the additional services from Tripod without having to register again.
Lycos will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its users to anyone outside of our partners or the Lycos Network without first receiving that users permission, preventing this information from appearing in unauthorized mailings and other solicitations.
Any information you submit when purchasing Lycos Gear, goods through the Lycos Store, and any goods on any co-branded store site (for example, the Lycos branded CD Now site), is shared with the companies that process your orders and ship you the goods.
==========
Robertson Marketing fulfills orders for Lycos Gear, and Skymall processes orders for the Lycos Store.
As Lycos expands its e-commerce offerings and strategy, Lycos’ use of the information submitted by you may change althought the sharing of information will not.
Opt-Out
We offer you the ability to opt-out of receiving information on Lycos updates and new services at the point of collection.
