ZipRecruiter Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes 
how ZipRecruiter.com handles personal information for the services on 
the ZipRecruiter websites and other related websites ("the Sites").
By using the Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, 
use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this 
Privacy Policy.
You may be able to browse the 
Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information 
about yourself.
Once you give us your personal information, you 
are not anonymous to us.
If you choose to provide us with personal 
information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information 
to our servers located in the United States.
==========
We may collect and store: (1) 
email address, physical contact information, and financial information, 
such as credit card or bank account numbers; (2) transactional information 
based on your activities on the Sites (such as marketing, buying, or 
selling products, and the content you generate or that relates to your 
account); (3) shipping, billing and other information you provide to 
purchase or ship an item; (4) community discussions, chats, postings, 
correspondence through the Sites, and correspondence sent to us; (5) 
computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from 
the Sites, and advertisement data; (6) other information, including 
IP address and standard web log information, and (7) supplemental information 
from third parties.
For example, if the information you provide cannot 
be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information (such 
as your driver's license, credit card statement, or other information), 
or to answer additional questions to help verify your information.
We may combine your information 
with information we collect from other individuals or companies (such 
as demographic data) to improve and personalize our services.
If you 
do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, simply indicate 
your preference once you sign-in on ZipRecruiter, or modify your account 
page, or follow directions to opt-out within an email.
We store and process your information 
on computers located in the United States that are protected by physical 
as well as technological security devices.
You can access and modify 
the information you provide us and choose not to receive certain communications 
by signing-in to your account.
==========
If you object to your information 
being used in this way, do not use our services.
You agree that we may use your 
personal information to: (1) provide services and customer support; 
(2) resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; (3) prevent 
potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service Agreement; (4) customize, track, and 
modify our services and the Sites' content and layout; (5) contact you 
about marketing, service updates, and promotional offers; and (6) verify 
information for accuracy, including with third parties as appropriate.
We may disclose your personal 
information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, 
respond to claims that content violates the rights of others, or protect 
anyone's rights, property, or safety.
We may also share your personal 
information with: (1) marketing affiliates; (2) service providers who 
help perform our business operations (such as website hosting, fraud 
investigations, and bill collection); (3) other third parties to whom 
you ask us to send your information; and (4) other business entities, 
should we merge with or be acquired by that business entity.
Without limiting the above, 
in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the Sites 
free from abuse, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information 
to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties 
without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, 
except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information 
is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or 
to report suspected illegal activity.
Some personal information is 
displayed on certain web pages of ZipRecruiter and may therefore be available 
to the public.
Your activities on the Sites may be traceable to 
you.
==========
Other people may see your products and services, feedback, 
ratings and associated comments, and similar information.
Notices 
may be sent to other ZipRecruiter members regarding suspicious activity 
and policy violations on the Sites and refer to your personal information 
and specific products or services.
ZipRecruiter Sites enable you 
to share personal and other information in order to facilitate your 
transactions.
We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your 
information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and 
security policies of those other companies before entering into a transaction 
and choosing to share your information.
When users are involved in a 
transaction, they may have access to each other's name, personal information, 
email address, and other contact information.
You agree to use user information 
only for: (1) ZipRecruiter transaction-related purposes that are not 
unsolicited commercial messages; (2) using services offered through 
ZipRecruiter (e.g. fraud complaints), or (3) other purposes that a user 
expressly chooses.
==========
ZipRecruiter uses "cookies" 
(small files placed on your hard drive) on certain pages of the Sites 
to help analyze our web page flow, and customize our services.
With respect to cookies, you are advised that: (1) certain features 
are only available through the use of cookies; (2) cookies help identify 
you and maintain your signed-in status; (3) some cookies are "session 
cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your 
hard drive at the end of a session; (4) you may decline our cookies 
if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use 
of the Sites; (5) you may encounter cookies from third parties on certain 
pages of the Sites that we do not control.
(For example, if you view 
a web page created or linked by another user, there may be a "cookie" 
placed by that web page.)
==========
Use unique numbers, letters, 
and special characters and do not disclose your ZipRecruiter password, 
if any, to anyone.
If you do share your password or your personal 
information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions 
taken in the name of your account.
Therefore, if your password 
has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify ZipRecruiter 
and change your password.
Once you make a public posting, 
you may not be able to change or remove it.
==========
We retain personal 
information from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent 
fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, 
assist with any investigations, enforce our ZipRecruiter Terms of Service 
Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
We treat data as an asset that 
must be protected and may use tools (encryption, passwords, physical 
security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized 
access and disclosure.
However, third parties may unlawfully intercept 
or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may 
abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the 
Sites.
Therefore, although we try to protect your privacy, we 
cannot promise that your personal information or private communications 
will always remain private.
==========
This Privacy Policy is effective 
upon use of the Sites for new users and is otherwise effective on January 
1, 2010.
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting 
the amended terms on the Sites.
All amended terms automatically 
take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Sites.
In addition, we may notify you in accordance with your account preferences.
