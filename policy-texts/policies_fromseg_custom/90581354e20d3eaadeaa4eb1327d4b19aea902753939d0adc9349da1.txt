Our Privacy Code
Our Privacy Code informs you of the practices we have in place relating to the management of personal information at TD in Canada.
The word “information” means personal, financial and other details about you that you or your authorized representative provide to us and we obtain from others within or outside TD, including through the products and services you use.
This Code applies to any person who has requested from us, or offered to provide a guarantee for, any product or service offered by us in Canada.
This includes individuals carrying on business alone or in partnership with other individuals and signing officers of our business customers.
It consists of five key principles:
1.
==========
Collecting and using your Information
Either before or when we collect information about you, we will explain how we intend to use it.
We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes, and we will use it only for those purposes.
We will obtain your consent if we wish to use your information for any other purpose and before collecting information from third parties such as credit bureaus.
Your information is used to help us manage products and services you have with us, to contact you about products or services you may be interested in having with us, to help us collect a debt or enforce an obligation owed to us by you and to manage operations and risk within TD.
Your information is also used in order to satisfy valid information requests from regulators and other organizations or individuals who are legally entitled to make such requests.
2.
==========
Releasing your information
We may provide your information to other persons in situations where –
our suppliers, agents and other organizations who assist us in serving you, need the information
we are required or permitted to do so by law or applicable regulators and self-regulatory organizations
we want to prevent, detect or suppress financial abuse, fraud, criminal activity, protect our assets and interests or manage or settle any actual or potential loss
we buy a business or sell all or part of our business or when considering those transactions
you have provided your consent
3.
Protecting your information
We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We will retain your information only for the time it is required and for the purposes we explained to you.
4.
Providing your information access and keeping your information accurate
Upon request, we will give you access to the information we retain about you and we will make reasonable efforts to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.
5.
==========
Respecting and responding to your privacy concerns
We will explain your options for withdrawing consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information, and we will record and respect your choices.
We will investigate and respond to your concerns about any aspect of our handling of your information.
In this Code, we explain how we fulfill each of these important principles.
==========

Why we ask for your information
We ask you for information to enable us to complete your request and to establish and serve you as our customer.
We collect the information we need and only use it for the purposes explained to you.
When you apply for a new product or service we will indicate in the application or agreement how we intend to use your information.
We will indicate clearly which information would help us to serve you but is optional for you to provide.
We obtain most of our information about you directly from you.
At the time you request to begin a relationship with us and during the course of our relationship, we may collect information about you.
==========
The information we ask for depends on which product or service you want.
For every product or service we need your name, address, birthdate, occupation and some identification.
Here is why we need some of the information we may ask you to provide.
• Birthdate
This helps us identify and authenticate you.
We may also use it to determine your eligibility for products and services that may be of interest to you.
==========
• Social Insurance Number (SIN)
Your SIN is required for products which earn investment income, in order to comply with the Canada Revenue Agency’s income reporting requirements.
Providing your SIN for credit products, or when applying for products online that do not earn investment income, is optional.
If you provide us with your SIN, we also use it to keep your information separate from that of other customers with a similar name, including information we obtain with your consent through the credit approval process.
• Employer name and address
This is required when a new account is opened or when you apply for credit in order to comply with anti-money laundering or other regulations.
• Financial information
This is used to assess your eligibility for any credit product, for example, a TD Canada Trust Credit Card, line of credit or other loan.
==========
We also use it to help ensure that the advice we give you or the investments you purchase (in the case of mutual funds or brokerage or investment accounts) are appropriate for you.
We may collect information from you and service providers with whom you make arrangements to provide those services (for example when you set up bill payments through your account).
We will use your information, including transaction records that reflect your business dealings with and through us, to analyze your activities to help us serve you as a customer and meet your needs.
==========
• Health information
This is required for some insurance products to ensure you are eligible for coverage, and may also be used to investigate and adjudicate your claims, and to help manage and assess our risks.
The health-related information you provide in connection with an insurance product will never be shared within TD.
However, it may be shared with administrators, service providers and reinsurers of the insurance operations to process your insurance transactions.
We also collect information during our interactions with you.
==========
• Over the Phone
We may monitor and/or record your telephone discussions with our representatives for our mutual protection, to enhance customer service and to confirm our discussions with you.
Customers who prefer not to have their calls taped can transact business at a branch location, through EasyWeb® Internet banking or through automated teller machines.
• In Person
We may use video or photographic surveillance to monitor and/or record the activity that occurs in and around TD premises such as at our retail branch offices or ATMs.
We use this information for security and investigation purposes, relating to, among other things, theft, vandalism, damage to property and fraud.
Customers who prefer not to have their image collected can transact business through EasyWeb Internet banking or EasyLine® telephone banking.
• Through the Internet
When you are using one of our websites, we may monitor and/or record your browsing habits as described in our Online Privacy Code.
When speaking with one of our internet live chat agents, or communicating with us through social media, we may monitor and/or record our discussions for our mutual protection, to enhance customer service and to confirm our discussions with you.
==========
• Through your mobile device
When using one of our mobile apps we may collect, use and disclose information collected from you or your mobile device as described in our Mobile Apps Privacy Code.
• Through Email
When you send us an email or when you ask us to respond to you by email, we learn your exact email address and any information you have included in the email.
We use your email address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further.
TD will not ask you to provide personal information or login information, such as username, passwords, PINs, IdentificationPlus® security questions and answers or account numbers, through unsolicited email.
If you receive an email claiming to be from TD that you believe to be fraudulent, do not respond and do not open or click any links or open attachments contained within the email.
Please notify us immediately by forwarding a copy of the email to us at phishing@td.com and then delete the email.
==========

How we obtain your consent
It is important to understand the different ways that we may obtain your consent to collect, use, disclose and share your information.
Depending on the situation and the sensitivity of the information, we may obtain your consent in different ways.
Express consent may be obtained verbally, online or in writing.
Implied consent may be obtained through your use of a product, or when you approach us to obtain information, inquire about or apply for products, or services from us.
We will not make your consent a condition of obtaining a product or service, unless it is reasonably or legally required, and we will clearly indicate when this is the case.
==========
Top
Why we share your information
We may share information within TD to manage your total relationship with us including servicing your account and maintaining information about you, to manage and assess our risks and operations, including to collect a debt owed to us by you and to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
Your information may be shared, stored or accessed in Canada or other jurisdictions or countries.
Your information may be disclosed in response to valid demands or requests from governments, regulators, courts and law enforcement authorities in those jurisdictions or countries.
Sharing your information within TD helps us determine your preferences and allows us to review whether any other products or services are suitable for you so that we may offer them to you – including special promotions that we believe will be of interest to you.
==========
In order to understand when you can withdraw your consent, refer to the "Respecting your preference" section.
Top
Why we ask others for information about you
With your consent, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including credit reporting agencies.
Obtaining additional information about you from parties outside TD helps us assess your eligibility for our products.
==========
For credit products, for example, we need to know your creditworthiness.
For this reason, we may contact other lenders or credit reporting agencies to get information about you and your credit history.
We may also contact employers or other personal references to verify information that you have given us.
We will not do this without your consent, but please remember that if you do not give your consent we may not be able to extend credit products to you.
Top
When we release your information
We do not sell or rent customer lists or personal information to others.
However, we may release your information to parties outside TD in certain circumstances, which include –
• For servicing purposes
We give a limited amount of information, only as necessary, to our suppliers and agents; for example, cheque printers and bank card manufacturers who provide goods and services to you, through us.
==========
These suppliers and agents may be located in Canada or other jurisdictions or countries and may disclose information in response to valid demands or requests from governments, regulators, courts and law enforcement authorities in those jurisdictions or countries.
• When required or permitted to do so by law or applicable regulators and self-regulatory organizations
We may release information in response to a search warrant, court order or other demand or inquiry which we believe to be valid.
This may include requests from regulators, including self-regulators, who are responsible for ensuring TD is in compliance with applicable regulations (e.g.
==========
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada).
• To protect our interests
We may also disclose information to any person or organization, including an investigative body, in order to prevent, detect or suppress, financial abuse, fraud, criminal activity, protect our assets and interests, or manage or settle any actual or potential loss or in the case of a breach of agreement or contravention of law.
We may also disclose information to help us collect a debt owed to us by you.
==========
• Transfers of a business
As TD continues to develop and grow, we may buy a business or sell parts of our businesses or consider those transactions.
As our businesses consist primarily of our customer relationships, information regarding the particular accounts or services being purchased or sold would generally be part of the business assets.
• Other situations where we have your consent
We will disclose your credit history with us to other lenders or credit reporting agencies in order to support the credit process.
We release only the information required to identify you, as well as facts from our credit records about your repayment history.
We may also disclose your account information to a joint account holder, including information about the account prior to it becoming a joint account.
==========
Top
How we protect your information
We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We have security standards to protect our systems and your information against unauthorized access and use.
For example, our systems have been designed to ensure that your Personal Identification Number (PIN), password and other access codes are always private and confidential.
For your protection, your access codes are known only to you – our employees cannot gain access to them and they will not ask you to reveal them.
All our suppliers and agents, as part of their contracts with TD, are bound to maintain your confidentiality and may not use your information for any unauthorized purpose.
When we provide information in response to a legal inquiry or order that we believe to be valid, we disclose only the information that is legally required.
==========
All employees of TD are familiar with the procedures that must be taken to safeguard customer information.
And to us, protecting the confidentiality of your information is more than a procedure – it’s part of our job.
It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.
We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to help ensure that they are being properly administered and that they remain effective and appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
==========
We retain your information only as long as it is required for the reasons it was collected.
The length of time we retain information varies depending on the product or service and the nature of the information.
This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us but only for so long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issue that may arise at a later date or for legal or regulatory purposes.
When your information is no longer needed for these purposes, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form.
==========
Top
Your right to access your information
Upon request, we will give you access to the information we have about you.
If requested, we will assist you in making your request.
Most of this information is in the form of your transaction records.
==========
These are available to you through your account statements or passbook updates, by visiting the branch or office where your account is held, or by accessing your account through our EasyWeb Internet banking, EasyLine telephone banking, Green Machine® ATMs and WebBroker® Internet brokerage service.
If you require other information, simply contact or forward a written request to the branch or office where your account is held.
We will ask you for specific details such as branch and account number.
We will advise you in advance if a minimal charge will be required for conducting the search and we will respond to your request within 30 days.
==========

If you have any questions regarding decisions made about you, we will tell you the reasons for those decisions.
If we relied on information from a third party, such as a credit bureau, to make the decision, we will provide you with the name and address of the third party.
Top
Keeping your information accurate
We will make reasonable efforts to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.
Having accurate information about you enables us to provide you better service and minimize the possibility that out-of-date information may be used to make a decision which impacts you.
==========
We have procedures and practices in place to help us maintain the accuracy of your information.
For most updates, we rely on you for information.
You can help by keeping us informed of any changes, such as if you move or change telephone numbers.
If you find any errors in our information about you, let us know and we will make the corrections immediately, and make sure they are conveyed to anyone we may have misinformed.
For information that remains in dispute, we will note your opinion in the file.
==========

Respecting your preference
We will explain your options of withdrawing consent to the collection, use or release of your information, and, given reasonable notice, we will record and respect your choices.
In most cases you are free to refuse or withdraw your consent at any time.
You may do so by contacting the branch or office where your account is held or by calling us at 1-800-430-6095.
Our staff will be pleased to explain your options and any consequences of withdrawing your consent, and record your choices.

==========

Use your Social Insurance Number with credit reporting agencies as an aid to identify you
Conduct a credit check in order to assess your creditworthiness and/or to perform a risk analysis
In doing so, however, we may not be able to extend services to you.

You cannot withdraw your consent for this sharing of information as it is necessary to support the credit process.
==========
