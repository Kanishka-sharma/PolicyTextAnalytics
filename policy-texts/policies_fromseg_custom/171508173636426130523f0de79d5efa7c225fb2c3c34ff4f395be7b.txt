Some of our advertisers use other Ad Servers which may set cookies too.
Unfortunately, we can't directly control their cookies either.
But you can, by taking control of your cookie management.

Some advertisers try to behaviourally target you using retargeting cookies across sites â€“ that's when you notice adverts stalking you across lots of different sites.
==========
We forbid this behaviour in the terms and conditions of any advertising contracts we enter into.
But sometimes Google does this through the ads it runs across the site.

You should be aware of how to manage this yourself.
This is a decent resource to help you.
