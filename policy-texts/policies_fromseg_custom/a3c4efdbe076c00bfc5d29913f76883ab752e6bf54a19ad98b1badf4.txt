These protections include using technical measures, such as encryption of Data, or a legal mechanism, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC), which are approved by the European Commission.

With that in mind, Index Exchange continues to certify to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Framework policies and comply with our obligations under the program for Data regarding EEA, UK, or Swiss individuals that is transferred to the USA.
You can find more information about Privacy Shield, including a list of companies that participate, such as Index Exchange, here.
