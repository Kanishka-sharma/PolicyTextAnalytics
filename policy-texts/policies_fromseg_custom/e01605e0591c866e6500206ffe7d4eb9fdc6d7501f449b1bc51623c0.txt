==========
We work to ensure that our Services respect users’ privacy rights.
To accomplish this goal, we adhere to privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default principles throughout the process of designing, building, and delivering our Services.
==========
We do not process information that directly identifies a particular individual such as an unencrypted name, address or government-issued ID number.
However, whether or not User Data we receive are considered personal or personally-identifiable data depends on, among other factors, the definition that applies in a user’s physical location.
For example, in some locations a user’s IP address may be deemed to be personal data, while in others it is
not.

DATA CATEGORIES WE RECEIVE AND USE 
We receive the following categories of User Data from our Data Partners:

mobile advertising device IDs such as Apple’s Identifier For Advertisers (IDFA) and Google
Advertising ID (“Advertising ID / Ad ID”);
cookie IDs;
hashed email addresses and hashed telephone numbers;
demographic information like age, gender, city/region, income, language and mobile
contract data such as prepaid/postpaid (“Demographic Data”);
mobile app usage data about apps installed/accessed on a user’s device and app events
and browsing data such as browsing URLs (“App Usage and Browsing Data”);
purchase data;
geolocation data.
Our Data Partners may collect data directly from users (both online and offline) or receive data from third parties.
We request that our Data Partners provide users with all required information about the use of their data and provide an opt in / opt out option according to applicable laws and regulations.
We may also use cookies, pixels and similar tools to collect users’ Advertising IDs or cookies’ identifiers ourselves.
These tools also automatically collect and send us information such as referral URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), user agent string, and IP addresses.
This information is a normal part of the log file information that is routinely exchanged as part of communication between operating systems.
As part of the existing programmatic technology for the delivery and display of advertisements on mobile devices, we also receive Advertising Bid Requests.
==========
When we obtain different User Data pertaining to the same device from multiple Data Partners, we aggregate such User Data and store it against the same Advertising ID, advertising identifier, associated with a device, (“Ad IDs”) or Cookie ID (a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the browser on which the cookie is stored).
zeotap also maintains a separate ID inventory, which connects the User Data into a common ID (“zeoID”) and is an internal pseudonymous identifier.
We enhance User Data to create de-identified data segments and aggregate such segments into segment lists or Ad ID / Cookie ID lists based on our Clients’ preferences.
We then share such lists with our Clients to enable them to effectively target the relevant users.
We do not interact directly with users or their devices, unless a user sends us a deletion request along with their Ad ID, as described below under “YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT
TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA (INCLUDING OPT-OUT OPTIONS)”
Below we describe the User Data categories in more detail.
==========
A. ONLINE IDENTIFIERS: 


ADVERTISING IDS 
Advertising IDs (“Ad IDs”) are user-resettable, unique, anonymized identifiers for advertising.
Ad IDs identify a specific device and are implemented both on Apple iOS (“Identifier for Advertising” / “IDFA”) and Google Android (“Advertising ID”).
==========
We obtain Ad IDs associated with de-identified User Data from our Data Partners.
Ad IDs are then used by our Clients to identify advertising requests and to deliver relevant advertisements.
==========
We may also use Ad IDs to establish a relationship between different User Data attributes pertaining to the same user.
For example, if we obtain User Data that indicates a certain user is between 25 and 30 years old, and later learn from another Data Partner that the user of the same device is interested in a healthy lifestyle, we combine this information against the same Advertising ID (“Ad IDs”) or cookie.
COOKIE IDS 
An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply a cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and is stored in the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.
==========
We set third party cookies on behalf of Publishers who provide space for the display of advertising within websites.
We may use cookies to establish a relationship between devices or data pertaining to the same user.
If we already have information about a device’s user, we may link the information stored in cookies to the device’s Ad ID.
==========
We call this activity of linking information “mapping.”
We use this information to facilitate the delivery of our Clients’ targeted Ads.
==========
B. BROWSING DATA: 


LOG FILE INFORMATION 
In the course of the mapping activity described in the above paragraph, we receive such information as referral URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), user agent string, and IP addresses.
When you come to the website where zeotap cookies are set, the log file we automatically receive includes the referral URL, which is the address of the website that you came from.
==========
We do not use and discard referral URLs within reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.
We use IP addresses to derive information such as country and carrier.
Afterwards, we discard IP addresses within reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.
==========
We use user agent string information contained in the log file to determine your device operating system and device model.
Afterwards, we discard user agent string within
reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.
==========
C. IDENTITY DATA: 


HASHED EMAIL ADDRESSES AND HASHED PHONE NUMBERS 
Some Data Partners or Clients may provide their offline data such as hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers.
We require that such data are hashed using secure hashing algorithms prior to sharing with zeotap.
We use hashed emails or hashed phone numbers to establish a relationship between offline and online user profiles pertaining to a certain user and enrich the profiles pertaining to those online users.
==========
For example, our Client would like to run an advertising campaign on mobile devices targeting users whose hashed email addresses and / or hashed phone numbers the Client already has.
However, without respective Ad IDs the Client cannot target the desired audience.
By comparing hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers provided by the Client with the User Data we have from our Data Partners, we can match hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers to Ad IDs corresponding to the same user.
As a result, we have a list of Ad IDs corresponding to the list of users the Client would like to target.
==========
Additionally, we can also enrich those lists with additional profile data, such as the ones described below.
D. PROFILE DATA: 


DEMOGRAPHIC DATA 
We may obtain demographic User Data from our Data Partners, such as:

user demographics (e.g., age or age range and gender);
general geographic area of the billing address and zip code;
predicted or actual income tier;
other demographic information that was received or collected by our Data Partners.
==========
Zeotap uses this information to create demographic segments about users, for example
users who are “males, 30 to 34, living in Brooklyn.”
We connect segments with Ad IDs so
that our Clients can reach their target audiences on mobile devices.
==========
PURCHASE DATA 
We may obtain purchase data from our Data Partners, such as:

items you have bought in stores;
items you have bought online;
items you have put in a shopping basket online.
GEOLOCATION DATA 
We may receive data from Data Partners about the physical location of a specific device, including latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS tools, Wi-Fi or cell tower triangulation techniques.
The location data we receive from Data Partners may be generalized, non-precise location data, or we may render the location data non-precise, in order to provide generalized location data to our Clients.
Our Clients may use inferences from this information to send localized Ads or targeted Ads.
We do not process precise location EU data.
==========
ADVERTISING BID REQUESTS 
In real-time bidding (“RTB”), Publishers send advertising bid requests (“Bid Requests”) in real-time to Advertisers, indicating that they have an open advertising space (“Impression”) to sell.
The Impression is auctioned among interested Advertisers and sold to the highest bidder.
==========
Bid Requests from mobile apps usually contain an Ad ID alongside information such as the IP address, type of the Impression (banner, audio, video), format, app, publisher, device, etc.
We collect and use the Bid Request and Ad ID in order to participate in the RTB process on behalf of our Clients.
We render IP-addresses we receive as part of the Bid Requests imprecise to prevent the identification of a user.
==========
However, we may store and process information derived from that IP address (information country and the telecom operator you are using).
We delete IP addresses after we no longer need them to extract this kind of information.
Our Clients may then use de-identified IP addresses to localize Ads.
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA 
Our Services enable our Clients to tailor advertising you see on your mobile device to your interests and preferences.
As a result, the number of ads that are not relevant or of interest to you will be reduced.
To achieve this goal, we need to process your personal data and such processing operations are covered by GDPR-compliant consents, which especially enable our Clients to use customized audience segments to improve and enhance their marketing activities and marketing reach.
==========
The consents are unambiguous, active, freely given and informed.
Our Data Partners who provide User Data to us collect Users consent to process your personal data and share it with us according their respective privacy policies.
The consent collected by our Data Partners complies with the GDPR’s requirements and enables zeotap and its Clients processing activities.
Any processing of your personal data by Zeotap is subject to your rights of choice and control as explained below.
==========
For example, for the purpose of enabling to share User Data with Oracle and its customers and partners to use such data for the purpose of personalization and linkage in order to market products and services to you (please refer to Oracle’s privacy policy available here, we rely on your consent.
Your consent is obtained on behalf of Oracle and its customers and partners by our third party data providers.
Zeotap is dedicated to the highest standards of privacy and is a member of IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau).

==========
Furthermore, we may share your User Data with third party vendors that help us extract valuable insights from raw User Data.
For example, if zeotap receives raw app ID like 123456, this information in itself is not useful.
Therefore, we use a third-party engine to convert the numerical ID to the actual app name (e.g. “Gardening Advice App”) which can be used for the purposes of targeted advertising.
==========
Similar engines are used for making sense out of Browsing Data.
In all of these processes, only the App Usage and Browsing Data are sent to external vendors who send us back the processed output.
==========
No identifiers such as Ad IDs, cookies, hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers are shared with third-party vendors.
We store User Data in data centers provided by third parties (such as by AWS and GCP).
We may also share your User Data information with our affiliates which are based in the USA and India that provide technical support and help zeotap operationally perform the services.
==========
We will also disclose your User Data in response to valid legal processes, for example, in response to a court order, a subpoena or other legal request for information, and/or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory reporting requirements.
We also may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our products and/or services and with applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.
We are required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national
security or law enforcement requirements.
==========
In addition, we may transfer your information to an entity or individual that acquires, buys, or merges with us, or our affiliates.
In these cases, we will require the acquiring company to carry on the material terms of this Policy, including the requests for account deletion.
==========
WHEN WE TRANSFER USER DATA INTERNATIONALLY 
When we share User Data with the recipients described above, such sharing may constitute a transfer outside of your home location.
By law, we are required to ensure that the level of protection guaranteed for your personal data by the European laws is not undermined by such transfer.
We enter the EU Standard Contractual Clauses with respective User Data recipients.
==========
HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL DATA 
We take appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect any personal data we receive from theft, loss, and unauthorized access.
We follow generally accepted standards to protect personal User Data throughout the entire use cycle starting from the initial transfer until deletion.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
==========
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA (INCLUDING OPT-OUT OPTIONS) 
Your personal data belongs to you.
You have the following rights with respect to your personal data:
-right to request confirmation as to whether or not we process any of your data, and, where that is the case, right of access to your data;
-right to request rectification of inaccurate personal data;
-right to request erasure of your personal data;
-right to restrict processing of your personal data if certain conditions are met, e.g., if you believe the personal data we hold about you is not accurate;
-right to object to us processing your personal data;
-right to data portability, which only applies, however, if you provided us your personal data directly.
The options to exercise these rights are described below.
==========
When we receive one or more of the above requests from you, we will verify your identity by asking for your Ad ID or Cookie ID and/or, depending on the method you used to submit your request, we may ask for an additional email confirming that the request is coming from you.
OPT-OUT OPTIONS 
To opt-out from the processing or exercise your other rights with respect to your personal data, you can directly contact your mobile operator or another Data Partner with whom you shared your personal data (please refer to their respective privacy policy).
It is the responsibility of the respective Data Partner to ensure that your request is honoured in full.
Additionally, you can contact us directly.
==========
The data we store are encrypted and stored against either (i) an Ad ID or (ii) a Cookie ID.
This means that we need your Ad ID and/or Cookie ID in order to find all your data that are present in our system.
Alternatively, we can check whether the data attribute that you sent us in your request (e.g. a telephone number or e-mail address) is stored in our system in a hashed format, however, if the hashed telephone number or hashed e-mail address is not stored in our system, and you did not provide us with your Ad ID and/or Cookie ID, we will not be able to find other related data that might still be stored in our system.
==========
Therefore, in order to be able to process and respond to your request properly and fully, we provide you with the following different ways to access your stored data and related information (e.g. data category, data provider) and/or to opt-out from our processing activities:
1.
You can ask for access and/or deletion of your data stored against a Cookie
ID, through our website portal which can be reached at following the link;
2.
You can ask for access and/or deletion of your data stored against an Ad ID,
through zeotap´s proprietary mobile App (“Data Protection Rights App”) that can be
downloaded via Google Play and/or the Apple Store;
3.
You can submit your request here.
If you are a US Citizen, please also visit the Section “DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION LINK”.
==========
Moreover, you can always use the following mechanism to opt-out form targeted advertising:
-you may select  “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “ “Opt-out of interest-based ads”” on Google Android.
In this case, we will keep your User Data until you request us to delete it, but we will not use it for targeted advertising purposes, and activity on your mobile device will be effectively invisible to us.
You may reset the Ad ID by selecting the option “Reset Advertising Identifier” on Apple iOS or “Reset Advertising ID” on Google Android.
This will delete your current Ad ID from your device and replace it with a new Ad ID.
==========
As a result, we will not receive any Bid Requests containing the old Ad ID anymore.
After a certain amount of time we will delete the old Ad IDs and related User Data.
However, we may receive access to your new Ad ID and match it with other User Data we might receive from our Data Partners over time.
==========
– you can clear or block our cookies in the settings of your mobile browser.
In this case, we will keep your data, but we will not be able to use it to target your device when you are browsing mobile websites.
However, regardless of the deletion of cookies, your device can still be targeted when you are using apps on the basis of your Ad ID.
-you may also visit the webpage http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and/or download the mobile AppChoices app.
For more information about targeted advertising and opt-out options, you may visit for example the webpage of Network Advertising Initiative’s at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices and/or Your Online Choices at www.youronlinechoices.com/uk.
==========
To make us rectify your personal data in our system, restrict its processing (including opting out of your data being shared with third parties) or in connection with other requests you might have, please contact us here.
Apart from all the above rights, you can also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe we our Data Partners infringed upon your rights.
==========
Please also note that using the above options does not mean you will block mobile advertising, but it means that the ads you receive will not be personalized for you.
INFORMATION RETENTION AND COOKIE STORAGE DURATION 
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we
collected it for.
We retain data until the occurrence of the following events:
-request from a Data Partner to delete certain User Data; or
-the user submits his Ad ID to us for deletion of associated data; or
-expiration of the zeotap defined retention period with a deletion of unused profiles after 3 months.

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS 


CALIFORNIA DOES NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES: 
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain online activities, over time and across different websites.
We do not honor “Do Not Track” signals.
==========
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT (“CCPA”) COMPLIANCE: 
The categories of Personal Information (as defined under CCPA) that we have processed (including according to CCPA definition “selling”) over the past 12 months and the usage purposes are the following:



DATA CATEGORIES WE RECEIVE AND USE: 


A. IDENTIFIERS: 


ADVERTISING IDS 
Advertising IDs (“Ad IDs”) are user-resettable, unique, anonymized identifiers for advertising.
Ad IDs identify a specific device and are implemented both on Apple iOS (“Identifier for Advertising” / “IDFA”) and Google Android (“Advertising ID”).
We obtain Ad IDs associated with de-identified User Data from our Data Partners.
Ad IDs are then used by our Clients to identify advertising requests and to deliver relevant advertisements.
We may also use Ad IDs to establish a relationship between different User Data attributes pertaining to the same user.
For example, if we obtain User Data that indicates a certain user is between 25 and 30 years old, and later learn from another Data Partner that the user of the same device is interested in a healthy lifestyle, we combine this information against the same Advertising ID (“Ad IDs”) or cookie.
COOKIES IDS 
An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply a cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and is stored in the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.
We set third party cookies on behalf of Publishers who provide space for the display of advertising within websites.
==========
We may use cookies to establish a relationship between devices or data pertaining to the same user.
If we already have information about a device’s user, we may link the information stored in cookies to the device’s Ad ID.
We call this activity of linking information “mapping.”
We use this information to facilitate the delivery of our Clients’ targeted Ads.
==========
B. INTERNET OR OTHER ELECTRONIC NETWORK ACTIVITY INFORMATION: 


LOG FILE INFORMATION 
In the course of the mapping activity described in the above paragraph, we receive such information as referral URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), user agent string, and IP addresses.
When you come to the website where zeotap cookies are set, the log file we automatically receive includes the referral URL, which is the address of the website that you came from.
==========
We do not use and discard referral URLs within reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.
We use IP addresses to derive information such as country and carrier.
Afterwards, we discard IP addresses within reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.
==========
We use user agent string information contained in the log file to determine your device operating system and device model.
Afterwards, we discard user agent string within reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.
APP USAGE AND BROWSING INTEREST DATA 
We may obtain App Usage and Browsing Data from our Data Partners, such as:
-apps installed/accessed on a user’s device;
-app events such as purchases or sign-ups;
-browsing data such as Uniform Resource Locators (“URL”s).
==========
URLs are web addresses, a specific character string that constitutes a reference to a resource.
Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.
==========
We transform App Usage and Browsing Data into aggregated segments based on interests or purchase intent (such as Sports Enthusiast, Health &amp; Fitness Buffs) which are of interest for our Clients.
ADVERTISING BID REQUESTS  
In real-time bidding (“RTB”), Publishers send advertising bid requests (“Bid Requests”) in real-time to Advertisers, indicating that they have an open advertising space (“Impression”) to sell.
The Impression is auctioned among interested Advertisers and sold to the highest bidder.
==========
Bid Requests from mobile apps usually contain an Ad ID alongside information such as the IP address, type of the Impression (banner, audio, video), format, app, publisher, device, etc.
We collect and use the Bid Request and Ad ID in order to participate in the RTB process on behalf of our Clients.
We render IP-addresses we receive as part of the Bid Requests imprecise to prevent the identification of a user.
==========
However, we may store and process information derived from that IP address (information country and the telecom operator you are using).
We delete IP addresses after we no longer need them to extract this kind of information.
Our Clients may then use de-identified IP addresses to localize Ads.
==========
C. CUSTOMER RECORDS INFORMATION: 


HASHED EMAIL ADDRESSES AND HASHED PHONE NUMBERS 
Some Data Partners or Clients may provide their offline data such as hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers.
We require that such data are hashed using secure hashing algorithms prior to sharing with zeotap.
We use hashed emails or hashed phone numbers to establish a relationship between offline and online user profiles pertaining to a certain user and enrich the profiles pertaining to those online users.
For example, our Client would like to run an advertising campaign on mobile devices targeting users whose hashed email addresses and / or hashed phone numbers the Client already has.
==========
However, without respective Ad IDs the Client cannot target the desired audience.
By comparing hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers provided by the Client with the User Data we have from our Data Partners, we can match hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers to Ad IDs corresponding to the same user.
As a result, we have a list of Ad IDs corresponding to the list of users the Client would like to target.
==========
Additionally, we can also enrich those lists with additional profile data, such as the ones described below.
DEMOGRAPHIC DATA 
We may obtain demographic User Data from our Data Partners, such as:
-user demographics (e.g., age or age range and gender);
-general geographic area of the billing address and zip code;
-predicted or actual income tier;
-other demographic information that was received or collected by our Data Partners.
==========
Zeotap uses this information to create demographic segments about users, for example users who are “males, 30 to 34, living in Brooklyn.”
We connect segments with Ad IDs so that our Clients can reach their target audiences on mobile devices.

PURCHASE DATA 
We may obtain purchase data from our Data Partners, such as:
