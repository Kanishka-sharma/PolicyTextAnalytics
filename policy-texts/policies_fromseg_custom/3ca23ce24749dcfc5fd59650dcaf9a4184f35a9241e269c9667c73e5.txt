Cookie technology is fairly commonplace on the Internet because cookies allow Websites to personalize their service based on a user's preferences.

A "referrer ID" is information from your web browser which shows us what URL you linked from.
This allows us to see what Websites linked to our Website.
This information is automatically gathered by our server.
==========
Referrer IDs contain no information that identifies you personally.
What is an IP address?
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet.
Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.
They are automatically gathered by our Web server when you visit our Websites.
Comet Systems will not use your IP address to attempt to identify you personally.

This kind of anonymous information is routinely sent by your browser when you connect to Websites.
Comet Systems uses this information only for broad demographic statistics.
For example: it tells us what percentage of users have Netscape browsers versus Internet Explorer.
