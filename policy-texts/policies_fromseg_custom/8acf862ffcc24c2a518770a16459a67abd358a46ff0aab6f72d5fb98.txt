Web Site Users
U.S. News generally collects personally identifiable information such as a name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number, or credit card information with your specific knowledge and consent.
How does the Web site use information supplied by me?
Occasionally, visitors to our Web site may be asked to supply certain personally identifying information, which is then retained by U.S. News.
==========
For example, we ask you for certain information if you choose to subscribe to our E-mail newsletters, register with our myusnews or our online discussion forums, or purchase either articles from our archives or our premium online content.
If you choose to give us personally identifying information at such time, such information will be retained by us and used only to provide you with products or services you have requested, or with additional information from U.S. News about U.S. News, its affiliates, or selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of use to you.
Any information from selected outside companies will be transmitted by U.S. News so that such companies will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information.
Moreover, we will not sell or rent any personally identifying information obtained through the Web site (other than in connection with magazine subscriptions ordered, as explained below) to any other company or organization.
If, at some point after giving U.S. News your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information from U.S. News about U.S. News, its affiliates, or selected outside companies, in general, you may opt out by E-mailing webmaster@usnews.com and put the words "remove my name" in the subject line of your E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you also may follow the procedures at our E-mail newsletter registration page.
If you provide identifying information to subscribe to our magazine, either online or offline, please read the policy pertaining to "Magazine Subscribers" below.
==========
From time to time, the personally identifying information that you provide to us may be shared with our suppliers or service providers who assist us in maintaining and managing our newsletters, myusnews, our archives, our premium online content, our online discussion forums, and other activities on the Web site.
Such suppliers or service providers may use your personally identifying information only in the course of providing services to U.S. News, but they may not use such information for other purposes.
While your individual information is protected as discussed above, U.S. News reserves the right to use such individual information to create aggregated, anonymous data about users in order to develop statistics about activity on and visitors to the Web site.
In addition, U.S. News may disclose personal information if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety, property, or rights of our users or the public.

What are "cookies" and how do you use them?
"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer.
Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying.
Cookies are placed on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site.
Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for users of our E-mail newsletters, myusnews, our archives, our premium online content, and our online discussion forums.
In addition, some advertisers may place cookies on your computer.
We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.
==========
In addition, we contract with certain third parties to help manage and optimize our Web site business, including the following:
We use the services of a third party marketing company, Omniture, to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the Web site.
To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by this third party marketing company at this Web site.
This information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.
==========
You can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such Omniture data by clicking here: www.omniture.com/privacy/2o7#optout
 
We also use a third party advertising company, DoubleClick, to deliver ads to you when you visit our Web site.
In the course of providing this service, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser which collects information about your visits to this Web site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information).
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third party advertising company, please click here:  www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.
==========
How is my credit card information used when I make a purchase?
When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide your credit card information so that we can process your payment.
During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted to U.S. News (in the case of our premium online content) or (in the case of our archives, subscriptions, and mail order products) to one of our suppliers or service providers.
In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that must use your information to process your order.
==========
Magazine Subscribers 
From time to time, U.S.News & World Report is approached by third parties interested in contacting our magazine's subscribers.
Perhaps they are in a similar business or have a product to offer that would interest our subscribers.
We may provide our mailing list of magazine subscribers to such third parties if we believe our subscribers would be interested in hearing from them.
Many of our subscribers find this a valuable and timesaving service.
If you subscribe to our magazine and want us to exclude your name from mailing lists provided to third parties, mail a letter to the address below, or E-mail us at the address below with your request.
Please specify that you would like your name removed from the mailing list, and include your full name and address or the address label from your magazine.
Mail your request to:

PO Box 421197

Or send an E-mail to usnews@palmcoastd.com.
Please allow six to eight weeks for your request to take effect.
