WeatherBug wants to make your experiences with us satisfying and safe.
Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much personal information to provide to us, and to control how we use that information.
Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy.
WeatherBug collects and uses information primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.
==========
If you choose to register with us, you may be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address, and/or information about what you like and do not like.
We request this information to provide our strongest value to you - a personalized experience.
Customers who personalize our service come back more often - and it's the customers that visit us often who make us successful - so we do everything we can to make WeatherBug your service and to give you just the content you want.
Information collected online is often defined as being either personally identifiable or anonymous:
Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that identifies specifically who you are, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address.
==========
We may also ask you for demographic information such as ZIP Code, gender and year of birth.
In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested.
==========
We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to judiciously provide Information to WeatherBug so that we may provide more valuable free content and products to you.
The amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose to WeatherBug is completely up to you.
==========
The only way we know something about you personally is if you register for a personalized service or promotion.
In other words, we will know Personally Identifiable Information about you only if you choose to share this type of information with us.
Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual.
For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visited this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.
==========
What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes anonymous information.
Some of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the data we collect is similarly anonymous information.
Anonymous Information may be collected several ways, including through the use of cookies, web beacons or from the device that you are using.
==========

If you prefer not to allow us to collect "cookie" information, you can disable the cookies by turning them off in your browser, although some areas of the Services may not function properly if you do.
We do not link IP addresses to your name, email address or other Personal Information.
This means that your session will be tracked, but you will not be personally identified.
==========

We use these services to help us measure how visitors use our Services.
==========
To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our online partners on the Services.
The type of information we collect includes information provided by the customer, IP addresses, cookie information (and other information that tracks browsing history).
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.
Although our online partner logs the information coming from our Services on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
==========

We may also use various technologies to determine your approximate location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
To offer you certain Services, provide advertisements based on your physical geographic location, and engage in the other uses described below, on some devices we provide you the option to opt-in to allow us to use your physical geographic location using GPS, cellular network location based services on your device, or browser services.
You may at any time opt-out from these geo-location services by going to the Preferences section of your WeatherBug application or the Settings section of your device.
