1) About Zebestof’s services
Zebestof specializes in creating personalized advertisements through “Zebestof Bestofbidder”.
We work with online partners to build advertisements for users who visit their websites and with publishers to display personalized advertisements.
==========
Our aim is to deliver advertisements that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing behavior.
Example of a “Zebestof Bestofbidder” ad: if you visit and browse on Website A, on a subsequent online visit to Website B, you will see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website A.
With our service, you should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Zebestof.

Our partners’ advertisements are displayed on many websites, also known as “publishers.”

These cookies are there so that the publishers recognize that Zebestof has a personalized advertisement available for your browser.
Their use is governed by the specific privacy policies of the publishers which can be accessed directly from their websites.
