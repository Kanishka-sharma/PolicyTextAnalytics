==========
2.2 Information we collect about you.

This includes which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you perform those actions, what language preference you have, what you buy and so on.
Device and browser data.
We collect information from the device and application you use to access our services.
Device data mainly means your IP address, operating system version, device type, device ID/MAC address, system and performance information, and browser type.
If you are on a mobile device we also collect the UUID for that device.
==========
Information from page tags.
We use first party and third party cookies and tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as web beacons) to collect data about visitors to our websites.
==========
This data includes usage and user statistics.
Emails sent by SurveyMonkey or by users through our services also include page tags that allow the sender to collect information about who opened those emails and clicked on links in them.
We provide more information on cookies below and in our Cookies Policy.
==========
Log Data.
Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.
The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type and timestamps.
==========
Referral information.
If you arrive at a SurveyMonkey website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.
==========
Information from third parties and integration partners.
We collect your personal information from third parties where, for example, you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us or where you have made that information publicly available online.
==========
If you are a Creator we may also collect:
Registration information.
You need a SurveyMonkey account before you can use SurveyMonkey services.
==========
When you register for an account, we collect your first and last name, username, password and email address.
If you choose to register by using a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), please see “Information from third parties” below.
Billing information.
==========
If you make a payment to SurveyMonkey, we require you to provide your billing details, a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment (e.g. a credit card number and expiration date or a bank account number).
If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder to determine which SurveyMonkey entity with whom you contract and the sales tax, if applicable, to be applied to your purchase.
==========
Account settings.
You can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your account settings page (or in your account settings page for our other products as applicable).
For example, your default language, time zone and communication preferences (e.g. opting in or out of receiving marketing communications from SurveyMonkey).

==========
How we use the information we collect
3.1 Creator
3.2 Respondent
3.3 Visitor
Many of our services let you share information with others.
Remember that when you share information publicly, it can be indexable by search engines.
Our services provide you with different options on sharing and deleting your content but we cannot delete content from search engines so you need to be careful about information you make public.
==========
We do not share your information or data with third parties outside SurveyMonkey except in the following limited circumstances:
If you are a Creator that is part of a team plan or Enterprise plan using SurveyMonkey, your account information and data will be shared with the primary administrator(s) and your survey data may also be visible to other members in your team with whom you share your surveys or with whom you collaborate.
Your administrator(s) will be able to view your account data, change your passwords, suspend, transfer or terminate your account or restrict your settings.
==========
Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.
If your organization has purchased an Enterprise account and you are using an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization linked to your individual account, you may be asked to migrate to the Enterprise Account and your email address, name and account data will subsequently be visible to the primary administrator for that account once you have been migrated.
You may be notified in advance of this migration and given an opportunity to change the email address linked to your account if you are not using your account for business purposes.
==========
To help us provide certain aspects of our services we use our affiliates and trusted key partners – in particular, we engage third parties to:
facilitate our collectors for sending surveys by email or text to Respondents.
For email delivery, we use Sparkpost and for text/SMS services we use Twilio.
We share the relevant contact information for respondents (email address or phone number as applicable) with these third parties.
facilitate customers in making payments and/or detect fraudulent payment attempts.
==========
deliver and help us track our marketing and advertising content.

On your instructions, we share your information or data if you choose to use an integration in conjunction with SurveyMonkey services, to the extent necessary to facilitate that use.
See further information here on our API partners.
==========
We also may have to share information or data in order to:
meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.

This form contains a list of all sub-processors used across all services covered by this Privacy Policy so please keep in mind that your service may only be impacted by a subset of these sub-processors.
==========
We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites.
For more information see our Cookies Policy.
For information about cookies used in our surveys please see Cookies used on Survey Pages.
If you are a customer of SurveyMonkey and separately use cookies or similar technologies in conjunction with any of our products and services, then you yourself will be responsible for complying with any laws related to the use of those technologies and this Privacy Policy is not applicable to that use by you.
We use certain cookies, as described in our Cookies Policy and here in our Privacy Policy, that you agree to when you use our sites and, in the case of some cookies, for legitimate interests of delivering and optimizing our services (where the cookie delivers essential functionality).
Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat users.
Each cookie expires after a certain period of time, depending on what we use it for.
We use cookies and similar technologies for several reasons:
To gather metrics about your survey taking experience.
For example, we will collect data about the number of clicks it took Respondents to complete a survey, whether they left and returned to a survey, whether they skipped parts of a survey and how long it took to complete the survey and other details about the survey taking.
However, this information is collated and kept at an aggregated and anonymized level only.
==========
To make our site easier to use.
Creators if you use the “Remember me” feature when you sign into your account, we store your username in a cookie to make it quicker for you to sign in whenever you return to SurveyMonkey.
We use cookies to authenticate your identity and confirm whether you are currently logged into SurveyMonkey or determine if an incident impacts you.
==========
To provide you with personalized content.
We store user preferences, your default language, device and browser information, your profile information which includes, the level of usage of service and the web-pages on our site which you visit, so we can identify you across devices and personalize the content you see.
We use cookies to measure your usage of our websites and track referral data, as well as to occasionally display different versions of content to you.
This information helps us to develop and improve our services (it helps us focus on the parts of the service you seem most interested in) and optimize the content we display to you (which may include marketing content).
We, or our service providers and other third parties we work with, place cookies when you visit our website and other websites or when you open emails that we send you, in order to provide you with more tailored marketing content (about our services or other services), and to evaluate whether this content is useful or effective.
For instance, we evaluate which ads are clicked on most often, and whether those clicks lead users to make better use of our tools, features and services.
==========
If you don’t want to receive ads that are tailored to you based on your online activity, you may “opt out” of many of the companies that are involved in such tailoring by going to https://www.aboutads.info, https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ or, if you’re located in the European Union, at https://www.youronlinechoices.eu.
Opting out in this way does not mean you will not receive any ads; it just means that you will not receive ads from such companies that have been tailored to you based on your activities and inferred preferences.
==========
In addition to the above, we have implemented on our websites and other services certain Google Analytics features that support Display Advertising, including re-targeting.
Visitors to our websites may opt out of certain types of Google Analytics tracking, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad Preferences Manager and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its Customer Ads Help Center.
If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
==========
We have a security statement related to our self-serve businesses (SurveyMonkey and Wufoo) available to view here.
For information about security related to our other business lines you can speak to a sales representative by completing the form here.
==========
If you hold an account with SurveyMonkey we do not delete the data in your account – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data.
There are controls in your account where you can delete data at the account level (all data in your account) and at the response level.
If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Creator how long your responses will be stored in SurveyMonkey services.
We also describe the expiry periods for cookies on our websites in our cookies policy.
==========
Our services are not intended for and may not be used by minors.
“Minors” are individuals under the age of 13 (or under a higher age if permitted by the laws of their residence).
SurveyMonkey does not knowingly collect personal data from Minors or allow them to register.
If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice.
If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact customer support.

Data Transfers and Privacy Shield Certification
Your information and data may be processed in and transferred or disclosed in the United States and countries in which our affiliates are located and in which our service providers are located or have servers.

EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.
SurveyMonkey Inc. participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.
SurveyMonkey is committed to subjecting all personal information received from the European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.

https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
==========
SurveyMonkey also complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
When SurveyMonkey receives personal information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as agent on SurveyMonkey’s behalf, SurveyMonkey has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) SurveyMonkey is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In certain situations, SurveyMonkey may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
==========
SurveyMonkey is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Please contact SurveyMonkey as described in Section 14 below if you have any concerns or complaints of any nature.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider, (free of charge) at https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-claim.
