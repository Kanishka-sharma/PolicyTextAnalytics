No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or on the Services.
In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at support@liftoff.io.

We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below.
We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.

WHAT INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?
A. Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.
For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, browser information.
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.
If you have provided us with a means of contacting you, we may use such means to communicate with you.
For example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of the Services.
==========
Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open a message from us.
This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.
If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by changing your user preferences.
Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
==========
B. Information Collected Automatically:
Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested.
“Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.
You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
Our partners may also transmit cookies to your computer or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services.
Also, if you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.
==========
When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.
For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Services, so that we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible.
We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience.
We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
==========
III.
WILL COMPANY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?
We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone.
However, we do share your Personal Information with third parties as described in Section II and in this Section:
A. Advertisers: We allow advertisers and partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers.
==========
For example, we might use the fact one of your users is located in San Francisco to show that user ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who that user is.
We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network.
Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.
Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
==========
B. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us).
You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.
We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.
C. Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.
Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
D. User Profiles and Submissions: Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user’s name, location, and any content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for Company’s services.
