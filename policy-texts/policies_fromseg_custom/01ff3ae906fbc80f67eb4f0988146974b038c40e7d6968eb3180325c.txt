==========
In circumstances where Digimedia is involved in live or videotaped presentations or the making of live or videotaped programs to school classrooms, prior notice of such activities to parents and guardians of all students to be involved in such sessions must be provided by the appropriate school authorities, and written permission to fully participate signed by parents and guardians must be obtained in advance by the appropriate education or organizing authorities.
Certification of such permissions shall be provided to Digimedia prior to any program.
Digimedia policy shall be that in any videotaping or audiotaping of groups of students, in classroom settings or elsewhere, that permissions from parents or guardians of all students present in the room or reasonable locale of possible taping, shall be obtained in advance – recognizing the technical impossibility of screening non-participating students in groups or areas from appearing in video images of the group and the potential of inadvertently collecting or broadcasting such non-permission images or audio elements.
Non-permission students must be excluded from the specific room or locale where taping is taking place, to eliminate the inadvertent collection of images or audio.
