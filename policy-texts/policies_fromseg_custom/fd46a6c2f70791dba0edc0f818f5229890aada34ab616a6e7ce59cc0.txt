About us
We are Bidstack Ltd and its group companies (Bidstack).
We are a cross-platform in-game advertising provider, whose technology enables video game companies and advertisers to create advertising opportunities in-game (the “Platform”).
==========
Game developers and publishers can integrate adverts into the game environment using our SDK and advertisers can use our technology to buy space and run targeted campaigns within video games.
We use information provided to it by game publishers and developers to create user profiles and audiences.
This means that we tailor advertising to users based on this information and may use certain information to enable it to identify where the same user is playing different video games which use our services.
==========
Similar to many organisations, our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications provided by the likes of LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share information about you.
==========
We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy practices.
When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the policies of those websites you visit.
==========
As part of our commitment to upholding high privacy standards and quality advertising, we are a member of several key industry groups; this includes the Interactive Advertising Bureau (iAB), the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) and we are accredited by JICWEBS for complying with the DTSG Brand Safety standards.
The purpose of this policy is to set out clearly to you how we protect your data and respect your privacy.
