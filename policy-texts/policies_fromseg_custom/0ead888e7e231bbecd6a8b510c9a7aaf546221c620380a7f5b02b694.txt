FOX Broadcasting Company, which operates the Internet site located at www.fox.com, recognizes the importance
				of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to our sites.
As
				a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or email address,
				is automatically collected from visitors to our sites.
Personally identifiable information about visitors
				to our sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted.
We may collect certain non-personal
				information to optimize our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type
				of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider).
We may
				use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content
				of our sites.
In those instances when we do collect personally identifiable information, the following policies apply:
Notice
FOX Broadcasting Company will notify you when we are collecting personally identifiable information about you
				and how we intend to use it.
For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with information
				or a product you requested, in connection with contest entry forms or for billing purposes, or in connection
				with community postings such as chat and bulletin boards.
Sometimes FOX Broadcasting Company engages in activities with business partners and sponsors with whom personal
				information is jointly collected or shared.
==========
We will try to make it clear at the time of collection who is asking
				for and/or sharing your information.
In situations where your information will be shared, it is recommended that
				you also review the privacy policy of our business partner or sponsor.
Use and Security
Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which
				it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.
==========
Such other
				uses may include sending you information or materials we think you will find interesting, or sharing the
				information with FOX Broadcasting Company's advertisers and reputable business partners.
However, at the time of
				collection, you will have the option of instructing us not to send you additional information or share your
				personal information with third parties.
==========
FOX Broadcasting Company is not responsible for the privacy policies or
				practices of our business partners.
FOX Broadcasting Company may use reputable third parties to manage activities available on our sites including,
				but not limited to, sweepstakes, contests, statistical analysis or chats.
==========
These parties may have access to
				personally identifiable information submitted by visitors who participate in those activities.
Similarly,
				we may contract with third parties to handle the fulfillment of subscriptions or requests for information
				you submit to our sites, such as sending you a newsletter.
==========
In most instances, FOX Broadcasting Company instructs
				these third parties to use personally identifiable information only for the specific purpose for which it
				is collected, and not to sell, market or transfer such information to other entities.
If FOX Broadcasting Company
				obtains personal information that has been collected from you by a third party, including our business
				partners, this Privacy Policy nonetheless governs FOX Broadcasting Company's use of that information.
==========
Please remember that any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes
				public information.
You should use caution when sharing information, as any of it can be collected and used
				by people you may not know.
Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to divulge any
				personal information.
==========
While FOX Broadcasting Company strives to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee
				the security of any information you disclose in a chat room or bulletin board and you do so at your own risk.
FOX Broadcasting Company may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to make our sites better
				and more responsive to the needs of our visitors.
This statistical compilation and analysis of information
				may also be used by FOX Broadcasting Company or provided to others, in aggregate, for marketing, advertising or
				research purposes.
If at any time after submitting your personal information to our sites you would no longer like to receive
				information from us, simply follow the "unsubscribe" directions at the end of any email communication you receive.
==========
FOX Broadcasting Company does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
Personal information may be disclosed in special situations where FOX Broadcasting Company has reason to believe
				that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or
				interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with FOX Broadcasting Company's rights, property, users, or anyone
				else who could be harmed by such activities.
Also, FOX Broadcasting Company may reveal information when we believe
				in good faith that the law requires it.
FOX Broadcasting Company maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of
				personally identifiable information submitted to our sites, and periodically reviews and updates its security
				measures in light of current technologies.
==========
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
				to be totally secure.
Although FOX Broadcasting Company strives to protect your personal information, we cannot
				ensure or warranty the security of any information you may transmit to us or from our online products and
				services.
This is done so at your own risk.
==========
Once we do receive your transmission, however, we make our best
				effort to ensure its security on our systems.
When credit card information is transmitted, industry standard
				encryption is used.
==========

Links to Third Party and Co-Branded Sites
FOX Broadcasting Company has established relationships with reputable business partners that allow visitors
				to our Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners.
Some of these sites, such
				as 
				or sites dedicated to online shopping, may be "co-branded" with a FOX Broadcasting Company logo
				(i.e., Fox, Fox Sports or Fox News); however, these sites are not operated or maintained by FOX Broadcasting Company.
These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with FOX Broadcasting Company.
As noted above, this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we obtain
				in this manner.
==========
FOX Broadcasting Company chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully.
However, FOX Broadcasting Company is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are
				linked to our sites.
==========

Links to third party sites
				do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by FOX Broadcasting Company of the content, policies
				or practices of such third party sites.
Once you have left a FOX Broadcasting Company site via such a link,
				you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site.
FOX Broadcasting Company sites may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with
				FOX Broadcasting Company.
Visitors to those sites should refer to their separate privacy policies and practices.
