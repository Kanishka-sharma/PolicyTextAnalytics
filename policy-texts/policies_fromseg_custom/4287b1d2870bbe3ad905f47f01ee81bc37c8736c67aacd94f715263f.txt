Log Files
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain non-personally identifiable information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, click stream data and other fields.
We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
==========
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at the web site.
The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you will find them at most major websites.
By showing how and when visitors use the web site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not.
Many improvements and updates to the web site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
This information is most easily tracked with cookies.
We use the information from cookies only to provide services better tailored to our users’ needs.
==========
Anonymous Usage Data
We collect some information about how people interact and manage their properties within AppFolio Property Manager on an anonymous basis.
For example, the information we collect about your rental properties does not include information that would identify you personally.
We may anonymize the information we collect about you and your properties by removing or "hashing" any data fields (such as name, address and telephone number), that identify you or that can be used to identify you personally.
We use industry best practices and state-of-the-art techniques to anonymize and aggregate data.
We get aggregate information by combining anonymous data that meet a certain criteria into groups.
==========
For example, we might want to know the total number of customers in a particular city and what the average rental prices are for that market.
The resulting number would be an anonymous aggregate total that we could then share with other customers.
We will not sell your usage data to third parties.
