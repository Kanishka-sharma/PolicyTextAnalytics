Zedge Terms of Service
1.
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Service description

The Service may also include access to products and services of independent third parties either directly or via links to sites operated by third parties.
Where reasonably possible, ZEDGE shall indicate the products and services provided by third parties as such.
Even though they may be co-branded with ZEDGE and so include ZEDGE's trademarks, the contracts for products and services provided by third parties are concluded directly between you and the third party.
ZEDGE SHALL NOT BE A PARTY TO, OR IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR, ANY TRANSACTION CONCERNING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE FROM SUCH THIRD PARTIES OR FOR ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION PRESENTED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.
==========
1.2 Applicable terms and conditions.
