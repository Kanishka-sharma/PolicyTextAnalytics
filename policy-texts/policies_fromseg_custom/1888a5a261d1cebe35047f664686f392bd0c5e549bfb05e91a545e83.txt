OPH may collect certain information you voluntarily provide which may contain personal information that specifically identifies an individual, such as your name, address, company name, telephone numbers, email address, other contact and demographic information, and credit card numbers (”PII”).
For example, you may choose to send OPH, PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form or submitting comments on the Site.
PII may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in forums or features on the Site.
Once collected, OPH may store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes.
The information that OPH stores is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information
OPH may automatically collect certain information when you use the Site, such as your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to the Site, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system (”NonPII”).
OPH uses this information to understand Site traffic and for maintenance of the Site.
Aggregate information (e.g., data OPH collects about use of the Site, or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities have been removed) helps OPH to understand trends and users’ needs so that the Site can be improved or otherwise tailor the Site.
This Policy in no way restricts or limits OPH's collection and use of aggregate information.
Cookies and Web beacons
OPH may automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” and web beacons.
Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters and are stored on a user’s hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history.
If OPH links cookies to any PII, this information will be treated as PII.
==========
Web beacons (also known as “1X1 pixels” or “clear GIFs”) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.
OPH may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site or to help track and analyze aggregate usage and statistical data from individuals who use the Site.
These third parties may place cookies, web beacons or other devices on your computer to collect NonPII, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties.
This Policy does not apply to the use of third party cookies or web beacons.
==========
If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.
However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site may not function properly.
==========
Third Party Sites
The Site may contain links to other websites.
Any personal information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy.
OPH is not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of websites to which the Site links.
Links from the Site to third parties or to other websites are provided for your convenience.
You are encouraged to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.

PRIVACY POLICIES FOR THE TECHNOLOGY
OPH Technology
OPH Technology is used by OPH, Clients and other third parties to serve advertising on websites of Clients and other third parties.
You may encounter OPH Technology when an OPH Client purchases or sells online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when an OPH Client places an OPH web beacon on its website, which you visit.
OPH uses the information collected by OPH Technology in order to help make the online ads you see more relevant to you, for ad delivery and reporting purposes, and for other purposes described in this Policy.
Personally Identifiable Information
OPH may collect certain information you voluntarily provide through the Technology which may contain PII.
For example, some of the advertisements delivered using the Technology provide users the opportunity to request information from Clients.
==========
These request forms require users to provide contact information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, email address, phone number and other comments.
This information is used to send information about Clients or OPH to the user requesting that information.
==========
Once collected, your PII may be stored for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes.
The information stored is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.
OPH may store and process PII in the United States and other countries.
==========
You may choose NOT to provide this information via the Technology, but instead call the Clients or OPH and request to have the information sent to you.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
OPH may automatically collect certain NonPII through the Technology, including but not limited to your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, the URL, the referring URL, the advertisement’s position on the website, viewing metrics, Internet Service Provider, your computer’s operating system, and responses to surveys implemented via the Technology.
This information is used to help make the online ads you see more relevant to you, for ad delivery and reporting purposes, for measuring and tracking the success of advertising campaigns, and for other purposes described in this Policy.
This Policy in no way restricts or limits OPH's collection and use of aggregate information.
Cookies and Web beacons
OPH Technology may automatically collect certain information through the use of cookies and web beacons.
This information is used for conversion tracking and to measure the success of online advertising campaigns, and the campaigns of OPH Clients.
==========
Specifically, Cookies correlate whether you saw an ad impression or chose to view an ad from that impression, with whether you later went to another page on the OPH Site or on a Client’s website.

Note that advertisements may still be delivered to your Web browser on behalf of companies using OPH Technology but those advertisements may not be as relevant to you because the advertisement request will only use information that is automatically transmitted through an Internet communication and not information collected using an OPH cookie on your computer.
Security of Information
OPH recognizes that many people are concerned about the privacy and protection of information as it is transmitted over the Internet.
==========
You should keep in mind that the possibility exists for unauthorized individuals to intercept any email message you send over the Internet.
In some cases, information can be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult to read if it is intercepted during communication.
==========
Certain practices allow web sites to provide an increased level of security for your personal information when appropriate.
OPH uses the following practices on the OPH Site to enhance the level of security for communication and the transmission of personal information:
(1) E-mail forms to allow customers to ask questions about OPH services and programs.
These are not hosted on a secure server.
==========
The possibility exists that unauthorized individuals may intercept email messages.
OPH is not responsible for the privacy of e-mail messages except those stored in the OPH system.
==========
(2) Transfer and reception of certain types of sensitive information such as financial information is accommodated by redirecting visitors to a secure server.
Appropriate security measures are in place in OPH physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected from you at the OPH Site.
Please be aware, however, that despite OPH efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
==========
To help protect the confidentiality of your PII, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.
You are responsible for all uses of the Site and/or the Technology by any person using your password.
==========
Please advise OPH immediately if you believe your password has been misused.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
OPH does not share PII collected from you on the Site or through the Technology with non-affiliated third parties except as described in this Policy.
OPH may, however, share your PII with vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with OPH in connection with the operation of the Sites or its services who need access to such information to carry out their work.
In some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information from you on OPH's behalf.
OPH may also share personal information with other third parties when you give your consent to do so.
OPH is not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor is OPH responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers or other third parties, and you are encouraged to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.
Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.

OPH may disclose and transfer any information, including without limitation PII and NonPII, as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of OPH.
