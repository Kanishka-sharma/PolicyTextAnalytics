When our users and/or customers (“you”) use Clario Services, we process data about you and your activity.
The data we process is divided into several categories.
Data listed in this section is necessary for us to provide and maintain our Services.
Also, we do not knowingly process personal data of anyone who is below 13 years old.
If you are a parent and your child uses Clario Services without your consent, please let us know at support@mackeeper.com.
==========
Account registration data.
You may access our Websites, without providing any of your data.
==========
However, to use the full range of Clario Services you will be required to create a proper MacKeeper Account ("Account").
To create an Account you will need to provide us with:
Login and password;
Name;
Email address.
Communication method with Customer Support (via emails, chats or calls).
==========
Please note that within an Account creation process we will check if your email address provided therein ever gets compromised in data breaches as well as turn on monitoring of related password leaks to ensure your security.
If you do not want us to enable data breach monitoring you are free to opt-out from this on the Account registration stage or turn-off the feature within the Product.
==========
You can create a MacKeeper account using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect.
These services will authenticate your identity and provide you with an option to share certain personal data with us such as:
Name;
Email address.
This data will pre-populate our sign up form and allow you to create an Account and use Clario Services.
==========
Data that we receive automatically.
When you enter to our Website, in addition to the data you enter yourself, we may collect some information automatically for optimizing your experience when using our products and improving the products itself, including:
Device information;
User configuration information;
Cookies;
Browser information.
Data collected via Products.
When you use Products, we may collect different types of data, depending on a Product that you are using.
==========
For example:
Via MacKeeper™ we collect:
Information about your device (OS version, ZD version, device name, model, and serial number, MAC address, platform, overall system information);
IP addresses;
Information about your apps (e.g. versions, size, date of the last update, etc.), services, and software and/or hardware you use;
Results of Find & Fix scan;
Browser information (for instance, name; version, default search page);
Network or Wifi details;
Your activity information (bugs, crashes, or system errors).
Via “ZoomDiagnostics” we collect:
OS version;
ZD version;
Platform;
Computer type;
CPU;
RAM;
VGA.
Note, during the fix session, an agent may install “ZoomDiagnostics” tool on your computer.
==========
It is a diagnostic tool that analyzes your computer, gathers basic information about the system properties and settings, and displays it in a comprehensible manner.
This tool can also detect some problems on your computer while working in the background.
For example, if something is wrong with the computer system, installed applications, or the memory is full, you may see some notifications with appropriate advice and instructions related to your situation.
==========
We do not collect any personal data through this tool.
Via Customer Support we collect:
Audio and/or video recording of a call/session;
Static images of your screen, which may be captured during the session only;
Chat correspondence;
Telephone number (in case of a call);
Your personal email;
Full name;
Mailing address;
The password to the system (in case of remote fixes);
Information about your device, services and software you used.
==========
Data breach feature.
Our data breach check is to enable you to reveal past third-party breaches of your personal data on the dark web and minimise the future risk of abuse of your personal data.
Also, an enabled 24/7 Data breach monitor within the Product will notify you if you have been compromised in new data breaches and your personal data is exposed on the dark web based on the email address you submitted.
==========
You may enter any email address(es) you want to check on our Website or within the Product.
The data breach check on the Website or within the Product requires us to transmit the hash of your email(s) to our third-party service provider to check if your email address has been involved in a data breach.
Our partner never has your email address, only the hash of it.
This is an unrecognizable jumble of numbers and letters.
Our data breach service provider will use the hash of your email address only for the purpose of checking if your email address has appeared in a data breach.
==========
Our partner uses this unique hash to determine which unique code has been violated on a specific website.
The partner will check it against its repository of stolen accounts, without knowing who you are, to define if your email address (i.e. the hash email) has been compromised.
==========
Once the check is completed by our partner, we pass its results to you.
In order to display your data breaches, we may receive from the partner access to it just to transmit the results of the check to you.
==========
This may include your leaked passwords associated with the submitted email(s).
Please note that we do not use or store this information in our files or systems.
==========
We only transmit the list of leaks to display them to you via Website or Product.
The data leaks are not stored but only displayed on the Website or within the Product.
You can, at any time, remove the email address(es) submitted for the check or disable data breach monitoring within the Product.
==========
Usage statistics and crash reports.
By default, we collect usage statistics and crash reports while you use our web browser extension.
==========
This helps us improve our Products and provide you with the best possible online user experience.
Usage statistics contain information such as your preferences, button clicks, performance statistics, and memory usage.
Also, these statistics include information about the websites you visit and your usage of them.
This helps us analyze our browser extension performance and make it better suited and effective for you.
For example, we may collect statistics to identify slow loading webpages or sites with push notifications as part of their functionality.
==========
Crash reports contain system information recorded at the time of the crash, and may contain web page URLs, depending on what was happening when the crash report was triggered.
You can change whether usage statistics and crash reports are sent to us any time.
You can also turn them off via MacKeeper preferences and/or Settings tab of the Chrome extension.
==========
Third-party data.
Some of your personal data, such as your name, email address, zip code, the last four digits of the credit card number, the type of subscription you bought, it's price, etc. may be processed and provided to us by third parties, such as cleverbridge©, PayPro Global©, and RevenueWire®.
Please note that we don't process information about your credit card number or other payment data - your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn’t ever go through our servers.
To make your investigation easier, we would like to provide you with the links to third-party policies:
Cleverbridge© Privacy Policy;
PayPro Global© Privacy Policy;
RevenueWire® Privacy Policy.
==========
MacKeeper Premium Services.
MacKeeper Premium Services offers remote access service to assist in diagnosing and resolving technical and system issues that appear on your computer.
To perform a remote connection, an agent from Premium Services must receive your prior explicit consent to do so.
Explicit consent — also known as express or direct consent — means that an individual is clearly presented with an option to agree or disagree with the collection, use, or disclosure of personal data and unambiguously signals his or her agreement.
Additionally, you can terminate the connection at any time.
==========
Agent will describe to you how to disconnect.
The entire process allows agent to access your device remotely to diagnose any conditions that may interfere with its performance, and either repair it or provide advice on what options are available to fix the issue.
==========
By taking advantage of this service, you are giving agents permission to log in to your computer, which may contain your personal data, files, documents, etc.
We strongly recommend that you secure your sensitive files before the agent connects to your computer remotely.
==========
Please do not leave these files on your desktop, as it is your responsibility to make your valuable information inaccessible to prevent any type of data loss or corruption.
To make your files inaccessible to others, you can use built-in encryption tools on your computer.
Here you can find the step-by-step instructions on how to do so:
Mac user - https://mackeeper.com/blog/how-to-encrypt-files-on-mac/;
In addition, we would like to inform you that even if you do not secure or encrypt your files and they are stored on your desktop, agent will only search your computer in order to identify and correct any conditions on your computer that may hinder its performance and will attempt to limit their interaction with your files to a minimum.
==========
When you request MacKeeper Premium Services, the agent will access your device remotely via third-party software, such as LogMeIn® and TeamViewer.
By accepting the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Notice of our Premium Services, you, therefore, accept the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy of LogMeIn® and Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy of TeamViewer.
Please read all Privacy Policies that are listed above to make sure that you agree to all conditions; otherwise, do not purchase or use our service.
==========
