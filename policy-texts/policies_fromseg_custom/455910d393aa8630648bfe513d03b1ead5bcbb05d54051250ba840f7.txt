What Information Do We Collect?
Member Information:A TechTarget goal in collecting Member Information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities to obtain other products and services from us and our partners.
Because we derive revenue from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services available to users.
We collect Member Information when you provide it to us through the following: when you register on one of our Sites, subscribe to an e-mail newsletter, register for one of our events or access certain Content or through surveys, as well as when you register to receive a demonstration or “test-drive” software products.
Several of the services that we offer on our Sites may require registration as a condition of use.
Once you register with one of the TechTarget Sites, you are no longer anonymous to us.
==========
To the extent that we combine any Clickstream Data or Supplementary Information with the information provided by you, it will be considered to be part of your Member Information.
Clickstream Data:When you access a Site, a small file called a “cookie” is placed on your hard drive.
If you register as a Member, TechTarget will use cookies to authenticate your identity when you visit the Sites, collect the data generated in connection with your clickstream activity on the Sites and to personalize your user experience on the Sites, including by serving and managing ads based on your activity on the Sites.
In all cases, TechTarget uses cookies to track the Clickstream Data of Members on the Sites and to obtain non-personally identifiable information from Users, such as the number of visits to the Sites that a certain User has made, the movement of the User through the Sites, and the searches that the User conducts on the Sites.
Please note that TechTarget does not collect Clickstream Data on any websites other than the Sites.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some TechTarget features and services may not be available to you if your cookies are disabled.
==========
We use electronic images known as “clear GIFs” (sometimes called “transparent GIFs”, “Web bugs”, “pixel tags” or “beacons”) that allow us to track general user traffic patterns.
TechTarget also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you accessed.
Although our Sites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in the section entitled Analytics and Online Behavioral Advertising.
Third Party Clickstream Data:When you visit the Sites, we may also allow our third party partners to place their own cookies on your computer in order to serve you with relevant advertising online.
This third party cookie may transfer non-personally identifiable information to the third party partner in order for them to track your activity when you visit the Sites and on sites outside the TechTarget network for purposes of serving you ads on topics in which you have a demonstrated interest based on your Clickstream Data; please note that we do not share any personally identifiable Member Information with these third parties and we can only access cookies that we set on your computer, not the cookies sent to you by other companies.
Also, when you leave the TechTarget network of Sites by clicking on Sponsored Content or advertising, these third parties may place cookies or clear GIFs on your computer.
This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information collected by third parties, such as through cookies or clear GIFs, when you visit their web sites or by third parties regarding your clickstream activity on sites other than TechTarget’s network of Sites.
In addition to the disclosure to third parties as described above, TechTarget has contractual arrangements with certain Service Providers under which these Service Providers agree not to disclose any information we provide to them.
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the Service Provider is to be considered to be the same as TechTarget.
Analytics and Online Behavioral Advertising: We partner with certain third parties to collect the non-personal information discussed above and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting.
These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device.
==========
In particular, the Sites use Google Analytics to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above.
You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics here.
The Sites also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your non-personal information for use in online behavioral advertising.
==========
For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Sites to target online ads for TechTarget to you on non-TechTarget websites.
In addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of the Sites to help target specific technology-related or other non-TechTarget advertisements to you based on your online behavior.
For information about behavioral advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website or the Digital Advertising Alliance website.
The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy.
If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies.
Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out here, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance program by opting out here.
Although our Sites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above.
==========

In order to interact in these forums, a User must first complete the applicable registration form and, in some case, terms of service for the Site.
