Special provisions apply with respect to sharing of FiOS TV customer information among affiliates.
==========
There are additional important protections that apply with regard to certain information we collect and maintain about the telecommunications and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services you buy from us and how you use them.
This information is categorized by the federal government as Customer Proprietary Network Information or CPNI.
Specific laws govern our sharing and use of this type of information.

Verizon Wireless residential customers and Verizon Telecom residential and small business customers receive a privacy notice regarding CPNI when they first order service and every two years thereafter.
For more information, please read the Verizon Telecom and Verizon Wireless CPNI notices.
As described in more detail in the notices, you may choose to opt out of the sharing of your CPNI within the Verizon family of companies for certain marketing purposes.
National, major and government account customers of Verizon Wireless and corporate and government customers of Verizon Business in the United States receive a CPNI consent form or service agreement requesting affirmative approval to share CPNI information.
As described in the request, you may decline or withdraw CPNI consent by not signing the consent form or by following instructions in the consent form or service agreement.
Your choice on CPNI consent will remain in effect unless you change it.

In addition, when you are speaking with a customer service representative, we may ask your permission to review your records, including your CPNI, to provide you with information about the full array of services provided by the Verizon family of companies.
Information Shared Outside the Verizon Family of Companies:
Verizon uses vendors and partners to help us offer, provide, repair and bill for services we deliver to you.
We share information with those vendors and partners to the extent necessary for them to perform work on our behalf or to participate in joint marketing offers with Verizon.
==========
For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our credit card processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested.
In our contracts with vendors and partners, we require them to protect the privacy and security of Verizon customer information we may provide to them and to limit their use of this Verizon customer data to the purposes for which it was provided.
They may not use this information for their own marketing purposes.
Verizon provides the names, addresses and telephone numbers of landline telephone subscribers to directory publishers and directory assistance services unless a non-published or non-listed phone number has been requested.
==========
We may disclose information that individually identifies our customers in certain circumstances, such as:
to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law;
in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or other emergencies;
to protect our rights or property, or the safety of our customers or employees;
to protect against fraudulent, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of or subscription to our products and services and protect our network, services and users from such use;
to advance or defend against legal claims, in court and elsewhere;
to credit bureaus or collection agencies in order to obtain payment for Verizon billed products and services;
to a third-party that you have authorized to verify your account information;
to outside auditors and regulators; or
with your consent.
Except as explained in this privacy policy or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or Web site visitors with others outside the Verizon family of companies for non-Verizon purposes without your consent.
If you purchase services offered jointly by Verizon and one of our partners, customer information may be received by both Verizon and our partner that is providing your service.
Each company's privacy policy may apply.
If Verizon enters into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets or business, customer information will also be transferred as part of or in connection with the transaction.

Keeping Children Safe
Verizon recognizes that online service providers must be vigilant in protecting the safety and privacy of children online.
==========
We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under the age of 13.
Verizon strongly supports educating parents and young Internet users on safe viewing practices and we offer a variety of tools to help children and parents avoid encountering objectionable content or communications while using our services.

Regrettably, there are those who use the Internet to view, store and distribute child pornography (or who engage in other types of illegal activity involving children).
Child pornography is subject to severe criminal penalties and using the Verizon network to view, store or distribute it violates our service contracts.
The Verizon network may not be used by customers in any manner for the storage, transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography and we will report any instances of such activity of which we become aware to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
We want to help make the Internet safe for everyone.
==========
If you have a complaint about child pornography, the soliciting of children for sexual activity, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children on a Verizon service, you can report it to us by sending an email to abuse@verizon.net.
If you do send us a report pertaining to child pornography, please include the words "child porn" in the subject line of your email.
You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through its CyberTipline located at www.cybertipline.org.

Information Security
Verizon has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we maintain, including Social Security Numbers.
Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information.
Under our security practices and policies, access to personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access, and sensitive records are to be retained only as long as necessary for business or legal needs and destroyed before disposal.
Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100 percent secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information.
Recognizing this reality, Verizon has incident response plans in place to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to personal information.
If you become aware of a security issue, please call Verizon's Security Control Center.
==========
We will work with you to address any problems.
