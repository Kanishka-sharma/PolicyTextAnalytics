VeriSign Authentic Site
                      Authentic Sites like microcenter.com use a VeriSign Secure
                      Server Digital ID to offer proof of identity, to enable secure
                      communications and to encrypt translations with site visitors
                      through their web browser connections.
The only way to be
                      sure of a web site's authenticity is to view the site's Digital
                      ID.
Viewing a site's ID assures that you are not being "spoofed" (i.e. the site is real and not an imposter) since it contains:

The name of the company which owns the web site (e.g.
                        Micro Electronics, Inc.) 
The site's registered Internet address (e.g. www.microcenter.com) 
The name of the Secure Server Certification Authority
                      under which VeriSign issued the Digital ID (RSA Data Security
                      or VeriSign)
