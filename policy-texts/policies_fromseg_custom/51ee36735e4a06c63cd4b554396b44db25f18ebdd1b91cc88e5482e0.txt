content such as wish lists and customer reviews and recommend merchandise and
services that might be of interest to you.

We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
Automatic Information: we receive and store
certain types of information whenever you interact with us.

designed to help you visit websites anonymously.

Do Amazon.co.uk and Amazon Jersey Share the Information They Receive?Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others.
Amazon.co.uk and Amazon Jersey share customer information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries which Amazon.com, Inc., controls and that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated businesses.
==========
In some cases, such as Marketplace, zShops and Auctions sellers, these businesses operate stores at Amazon.co.uk or sell offerings to you at Amazon.co.uk.
In other cases, we operate stores, provide services or sell product lines jointly with or on behalf of these businesses.
Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings.
==========
You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party.
Third Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service.
They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.

Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon.co.uk customers on behalf of other businesses.
When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address.
If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your
Customer Communication
Preferences.
==========
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units.
In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
==========
Protection of Amazon.co.uk, Amazon Jersey and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Amazon.co.uk, Amazon Jersey, our users or others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice.
With your consent: other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.How Secure Is Information About Me?
We work to protect the security of your information
during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
encrypts information you input.
We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card
numbers when confirming an order.
Of course, we transmit the entire credit card
number to the appropriate credit card company during order
processing.
==========
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural
safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of
personally identifiable customer information.
Our security procedures mean that
we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal
information to you.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorised
access to your password and to your computer.
