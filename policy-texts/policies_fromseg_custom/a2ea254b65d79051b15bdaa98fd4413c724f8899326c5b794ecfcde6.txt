Fiksu Application Marketing
Fiksu buys mobile advertising space on behalf of certain mobile application providers (Clients).
When you click on a Client ad or application link delivered by Fiksu, Fiksu servers receive and store the "unique device identifier" or "UDID," which is a number uniquely associated with your mobile device.
Fiksu cannot use the UDID to identify you personally, but it does enable us to collect information about the kind of mobile device you use, the operating system for your mobile device, the applications you download from Fiksu Clients, when, how, and how often you use those applications.
We use your UDID and information about Client applications you download to report on the number of unique users who click through Fiksu Client ads, and the number of those users who download Fiksu Client applications as a result of those ads.
==========
We also use your UDID and the information associated with your UDID over time (e.g., the applications you download, when and how you use those applications, and any publisher-provided demographic data) to enhance our services and to select Fiksu Client ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.
Fiksu may use agents and contractors in order to provide our services to Clients.
If such agents and contractors have access to your UDID and/or the information associated with your UDID, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Fiksu.
We disclose your UDID and/or the information associated with your UDID over time for the following purposes only:
To Fiksu Clients when you click on their ad and/or download their application;    
In response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena);    
When we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the application or website, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
In other circumstances when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Fiksu, Fiksu Clients, and third parties.
