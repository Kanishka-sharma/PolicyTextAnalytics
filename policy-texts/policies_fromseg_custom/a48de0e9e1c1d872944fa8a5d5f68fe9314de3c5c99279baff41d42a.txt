COLLECTION OF INFORMATION 

 

Information is collected from you, our customer, at several different points during
  your visit(s) to the LiveCareer Site.
==========
Registration--You must register in order to use a Site.
During registration, you are required to provide certain categories of information, 
  such as name, e-mail address, a password, whether you are a student, employed, or 
  in another category, date of birth, gender and country of citizenship.
In addition, we require that you provide other categories of information,
  such as an area of study that interests you and career interests you have.
==========
LiveCareer asks for this information so that you are able to maximize the 
  effectiveness of our career tools and have the best possible experience with LiveCareer.
Optional Information--At various other points during your visit to LiveCareer, you may be
    asked to provide information about yourself.
For example, you may wish to sign up for information 
    about online courses relevant to your career interests.
The use of other services which require the 
    input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part.
You have the choice 
    about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our Site.
==========
Passive Collection of Information--In addition to the information which you actively 
    provide to LiveCareer by, for example, completing the registration form, LiveCareer collects 
    information about how you interact with our Site.
LiveCareer collects passive information
    for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the Site and the compilation 
    of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for
    disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners.
The types of passive 
    information collected by this Site include, without limitation, your IP address,
    which type of browser you are using, where you go on our Site and how long you stay on any 
    part of our Site.
==========
Passive information does not identify you to LiveCareer by name and LiveCareer 
    does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.
Collection of Information from Children--LiveCareer abides by federal law and 
    the guidelines set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy.
As such, LiveCareer will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow
    the registration of young people under the age of 14.
==========
Tell-A-Friend Programs--You can choose to let a friend, your parents, or your 
    son/daughter know about LiveCareer through our Tell-A-Friend referral service.
If you choose to use the Tell-A-Friend service, we will ask you for your friend/relative's 
    name and e-mail address and LiveCareer will send your friend/relative an e-mail inviting him 
    or her to visit LiveCareer to learn more about our services.
You will also have the opportunity
    to send your career test results to your friend/relative to facilitate a discussion with them about
    your career.
LiveCareer stores your friend's contact information for the sole purpose of sending the e-mail.

USE OF INFORMATION



 

    The information which you supply to LiveCareer enables us to provide the assessment and other
    tools which you select by matching the information you provide to our database of occupations, 
    educational opportunities and other resources, including data provided by others who have visited
    our Site.
Your information may be used in various ways, including:
    
      (i)	For some tests/tools, the information you provide is aggregated with information from
      other Customers to create a comparative database that allows LiveCareer to produce results and
      reports for you.
When your information or the information of other Customers is used in this 
      way, it is aggregated and is not used or disclosed in a way that allows third parties 
      (including other Customers) to identify any individual user.
==========
(ii)	LiveCareer uses your information in order to customize our Site to your interests and 
      enhance your overall experience on our Site.
LiveCareer tries to recognize you using various 
      methods, including having you log in with your e-mail address and your password.
Once LiveCareer
      recognizes you, pages, advertisements and other content is customized for you so that you can see
      what interests you the most.
(iii)	In addition, as described above, LiveCareer utilizes passive information to learn
      more about how you interact with our Site.
This passive information may be combined with your
      other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience on our Site and the
      compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal 
      purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners and other
      who maybe interested in learning about the type of information LiveCareer collects.
This 
      aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify 
      any individual user.
Contacting You by E-Mail--LiveCareer may use your contact information 
      periodically in order to send you e-mail regarding updates at the LiveCareer Site, such as 
      new LiveCareer opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you.
The 
      frequency of these messages will vary depending upon your profile, including the types of career
      resources and other activities that you have indicated an interest in.
==========
In addition, we may 
      send you free informational newsletters or notices relating to topics which may be of special
      interest to you, including career planning tools, financial aid, admissions tips, job 
      opportunities and job advice.
Finally, if you provide LiveCareer with permission at the time 
      of registration, you may also receive commercial e-mails.
Out of respect for the privacy of      
      our users, we present the option to opt-out of (i) receiving e-mails from LiveCareer about new 
      products and services or test features; (ii) receiving newsletters and/or commercial e-mails 
      whenever such messages are sent by LiveCareer; (iii) LiveCareer's providing your information 
      to leading companies, colleges and universities so that these entities may send you emails 
      directly about promotions and offers; and (iv) special offer emails from LiveCareer and our
      marketing partners.
E-mail messages from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions
      of this Privacy Policy, but all such third parties are strongly encouraged to include opt-out 
      procedures in their messages to you.
3.
==========
SHARING OF INFORMATION



 


    LiveCareer will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than 
    in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
During the registration process, and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, 
    LiveCareer asks you whether information about you may be sent to third parties who have products, 
    services and opportunities which may be useful to you.
LiveCareer understands how important your 
    information is to you.
Therefore, LiveCareer does not share any information with third parties that 
    can be tied to you without your permission and allows you the option to opt-out of having your 
    information shared with third parties.
If you do not exercise this opt-out option, personal information
    about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to LiveCareer)
    may be shared with colleges, universities, potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, 
    marketers (possibly in the form of list rental or license) and other organizations.
These selected third 
    parties may use your personal information to provide you with promotional materials about goods and
    services offered by them.
Third parties to whom the personal identifying information is rented and/or 
    licensed will be encouraged to target their offers carefully.
When LiveCareer shares your personal 
    information with a third party under any circumstance described in this Privacy Policy, your personal 
    information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third 
    party and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further
    sharing of your personal information.
Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your personal
    information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business 
    partners.
This aggregate information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual 
    user.
==========
Third Party Service Providers--From time to time, LiveCareer may decide that it is more efficient
    to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to LiveCareer's users.
If we 
    use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then 
    information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third 
    party to provide these services.
These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally 
    identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by LiveCareer.
The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our Site, 
    which is governed by a more specific provision (Links to Other Sites) below.
==========
Disclosure to Law Enforcement and Similar
      Disclosures
    --While LiveCareer strives to protect the personal information of our users, LiveCareer will release
    personal information (i) if required by law, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or 
    appropriate; (ii) to protect the safety and security of LiveCareer including, without limitation, the safety
    and security of property that belongs to LiveCareer (iii) we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, 
    or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the 
    physical safety of any person or violations of LiveCareer's Terms of Use.
Transfer of Ownership

      -- In the event of a transfer of ownership of LiveCareer, such as an acquisition by or merger
      with another company, customer information will likely be included among the business assets transferred.
LiveCareer will notify you, via email or prominent notice on the LiveCareer website, prior to any personal 
      information being transferred in accordance with such transfer of ownership and becoming subject to a 
      different privacy policy.

==========
SECURITY

  misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control.
You are the only user 
  authorized to update your profile, unless you provide your password information to another party.
LiveCareer helps protect personally identifiable information by utilizing both
  online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the 
  places where your information is stored.

  security procedures are regularly reviewed and revised, if necessary, by the Privacy Team at LiveCareer.
