What we collect
Like most website operators, Canonical collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor's request.

When you register to use certain parts of our websites, such as wikis or message boards, we ask for personally identifying information such as your full name, email address, and a password.
