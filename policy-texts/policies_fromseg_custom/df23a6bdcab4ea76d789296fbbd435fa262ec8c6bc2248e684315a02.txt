As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules.
You may bring claims only on your own behalf.
==========
Neither you nor Kuula will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement.
You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Kuula is a party to the proceeding.
==========
This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Kuula or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.

You must use this address to opt out: contact@kuula.co
You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Kuula account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.
==========
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Kuula.
Time Limitation on Claims
You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Kuula must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
==========
Governing Law & Venue
These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE.
For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Kuula exclusively in a state or federal court located in Los Angeles, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Los Angeles County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.
==========
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
Kuula's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.
No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.
Kuula reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.
This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Kuula.
==========
Entire Agreement

These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Kuula and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Kuula.
You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Kuula.
Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Kuula will be null and void.
Kuula may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent.
If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.
==========
Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use.
These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
==========

Privacy Policy
It is Kuula's ("Kuula," "we", "our" or "us") policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how we use the information and how you can control what you provide us in connection with Kuula services (collectively, the “Service”).
==========
By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos and other materials ("User Content") and to share User Content publicly.
This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, our GDPR FAQ and our Terms of Use.
Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").
1.
==========
What information is collected
We collect the following types of information.
Information you provide us directly:
			
Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Kuula account.
Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., display name, picture).
This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Kuula.
User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
Communications between you and Kuula.
For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).
==========
Transaction information: Those who engage in transactions with Kuula – by purchasing a Pro or Business account, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
In each case, Kuula collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Kuula.
Kuula does not store the credit card details that are entered at the time of purchase.
If using Stripe (our payment processor), that information is sent directly to them and we only store the necessary references to your account such that we can securely interact with the Stripe API.
==========
Kuula does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
==========
Analytics information: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.
These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service.
We collect and use this analytics information but it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
==========
Cookies and similar technologies: When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Kuula and provide features to you.
We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.
==========
Log file information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app.
It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
==========
Metadata: Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content.
For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), comments or other data.
This makes your User Content more searchable by others.
2.
==========
How information is used
Kuula uses information it collects to deliver the Service to you and continuously enhance your experience.
If you are a registered user of a Kuula website and have supplied your email address, Kuula may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Kuula and our products.
We primarily use our product blog or social media to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
3.
==========
With whom information is shared
We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Kuula without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.
Parties with whom we may share your information: We may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers").
Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
==========
We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.
This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.
We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.
==========
Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content: Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public.
Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.
Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable and embeddable by other Users.
If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, if saved by other Users or third parties.
==========
What happens in the event of a change of control: If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Kuula or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred.
You will continue to own your User Content.
The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.
==========
Responding to legal requests and preventing harm: We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.
