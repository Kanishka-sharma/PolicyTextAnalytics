Webshots, part of 
            the Excite@Home family





Part of the reason that Webshots chose to merge with Excite@Home is our shared concern for 
            our users.
Webshots has always been committed to protecting the 
            privacy of our users, and Excite@Home is an industry leader in 
            privacy protection.
We are committed to making your Webshots experience 
            enjoyable and safe.

When you download our software, our photos,
            register for our online services, send our electronic greetings, or
            other email, 
            the information you provide to us is used only to customize your
            experience and to deliver 
            email notifications to you (or people you designate as your
            recipients).
The names and email 
            addresses you give us when you simply send a card are NOT sold, 
            compiled into any type of mailing list, or otherwise used for any 
            type of email solicitation.
Our data 
            collection policies with regard to current and future services allow you 
            to choose how much information you provide to us, and to control how 
            we use that information.

The Internet is rapidly changing the way all of us communicate 
            and interact with each other.
While the Internet allows each of us 
            access to a greater array of information and services than has ever 
            been available, these new online activities do raise new challenges, 
            such as the privacy issues addressed in this policy.
Excite@Home is 
            committed to working with public policy organizations, industry 
            groups, and government institutions to understand and address these 
            challenges as they arise.
==========
But most importantly, having a 
            relationship with our customers that is founded on trust is not only 
            good manners, it is also good business.
Any feedback you'd like to 
            provide to help us better meet your expectations in this arena is 
            welcomed.
Our Commitment to You
Excite@Home wants to make your online experience satisfying and 
            safe.
Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much 
            information to provide to us, and to control how we use that 
            information.
Our goal is to provide you with a robust online 
            experience while allowing you to control your privacy.
Excite@Home collects information online primarily to make it 
            easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.
==========
Depending on 
            the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times 
            to provide information such as your name, email address, or 
            information about what you like and do not like.
On other occasions 
            such as when we provide items for purchase online, we may request 
            your credit card number to conclude the transaction, or your mailing 
            address to ensure proper delivery.
We request this information to 
            provide our strongest value to you - a personalized online 
            experience.
Customers who personalize our service come back more 
            often - and it's the customers that visit us often who make us 
            successful - so we do everything we can to make Excite@Home your 
            service with your name on it and to give you just the content you 
            want.
Information collected online is often 
            defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable: 
            

Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot 
              be tied back to a specific individual.
==========
For instance, we may know 
              that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not 
              necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of 
              birth.
What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes 
              anonymous information, much like how your hometown's bus service 
              knows how many people take a given route - but doesn't necessarily 
              know who those people are.
Many of the individuals who access our 
              services decline to use the personalization features that are 
              available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous 
              to us and the data we collect is similarly anonymous information.
Personally Identifiable Information refers to 
              information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your 
              name, phone number, or postal address.
In many cases we need this 
              information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that 
              have requested.
Examples of the use of such information would be the
                Webshots Daily or our award-winning "My Excite Start Page,"
                which uses your mailing 
              address to customize TV schedules, weather reports, and sports 
              scores; our commerce-enabled services, which allow our partners to 
              ship the products you buy to your door; or our free Excite Mail 
              email service, which uses your name as part of a security 
              mechanism to protect your messages from being read by anyone but 
              you.
==========
We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it 
              beneficial to judiciously provide Personally Identifiable 
              Information to Excite@Home so that we may provide more valuable 
              free content and products to you.
The amount of Personally 
            Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose to 
            Excite@Home is completely up to you.
The only way we know something 
            about you personally is if you register for a personalized service 
            or enter one of our Excite@Home Network sweepstakes.
In other words, 
            we will know Personally 
            Identifiable Information about you only if you choose to share 
            this type of information with us.
==========
Third Party Advertisers.
Webshots works with a third
                party that serves ads to this website.
This site uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of
            ads, promotions and other marketing messages.
To do this, Engage collects
            and stores anonymous data typically through the use of cookies.

Our Commitment to Your Family
Like you, we at the Excite@Home Network have children of our own 
            and are concerned about their safety when they use the Internet.
We 
            want you and your family to be safe while visiting our Internet 
            sites.
That is why we have established the following guidelines for 
            the way we interact with children when they access our services.
==========
Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
            Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request Personally 
            Identifiable Information from anyone under the age of 13 without 
            requesting verifiable parental consent.
As a TRUSTe Premier Sponsor, 
            we will place a "Children's Seal" on any page directly targeted to 
            children under 13 that requests the disclosure of consumer 
            information, informing those children that parental consent is 
            needed, and we will use a secure and verifiable method for 
            confirmation of such consent.
Additionally, Excite@Home offers levels of protection for minors 
            that are beyond what either TRUSTe or federal law requires.
While 
            Excite@Home will not target registration to those under 13 without 
            using the safeguards listed above, we recognize that some minors 
            will utilize the registration products associated with our general 
            release products.
==========
If a customer registers with us and their birth 
            date indicates that they are not just under 13, but are in fact any 
            age less than 18, we will:
            

Never knowingly send a copy of a mass emailing to them, even 
              if they gave us permission to email them during registration.
Never voluntarily share their customer information with any 
              third party, even if they gave us permission to share their 
              customer information during registration.
Never list them in any Member Directory in a manner in which 
              their age can be easily identified.
==========
The only exceptions to the above policies regarding 
            data collected from minors will be for bona fide non-profit 
            organizations that offer outreach and support to children.
In cases 
            where minors have volunteered information in the context of a 
            cobranded peer counseling or mentoring environment on an Excite@Home 
            Network domain, this information will be shared with that cobranded 
            non-profit organization.
An example of such a bona fide non-profit 
            organization would be the outstanding SHINE organization (Seeking 
            Harmony in Neighborhoods Everywhere) that Excite@Home supports.
In summary, the management and employees of Excite@Home are very 
            proud of our industry-leading steps to safeguard the privacy of all 
            minors online.
==========
We're doing what we can to ensure that Personally 
            Identifiable Information regarding registered users under the 
            age of 18 won't leave our company for commercial use; and that 
            someone using our site won't be able to easily look up their age.
These protections are a start, but there are some actions we cannot 
            control, and in these areas we need help from the child's parent or 
            guardian as well.
For instance, we cannot stop a minor from giving 
            their age in our unmoderated online chat sessions - but parents or 
            guardians can counsel their children against taking such actions.
For more information about protecting the privacy and safety of 
            minors online, we recommend that you visit the Parents 
            and Children portion of the TRUSTe site, which contains 
            information and links to other resources on this subject.
==========
Can Excite@Home Do Something About Spam?
In the online world, 
            unsolicited junk email is referred to as "Spam."
Nearly all of us at 
            one time or another will find Spam in our email inboxes.
Sadly, 
            there is no current solution to completely prevent the delivery of 
            Spam although our Excite Mail team is constantly working on 
            solutions that help.
==========
Your email address can become available to 
            "Spammers" in any number of ways.
You may have entered your email 
            address at a non-Excite@Home Web site where you signed up for a 
            product or service.
Or maybe you posted a message to a discussion 
            board and included your email address - from which it can be 
            automatically plucked by disreputable firms.
Or, you might have done 
            nothing at all.
==========
Unfortunately, some Spammers send massive amounts of 
            email to various Internet domains, including ours and those run by 
            companies such as Yahoo!® or AOL®.
These individuals target large 
            lists of probable email names (like "John") and the resultant email 
            address (like "john@excite.com").
While these activities are 
            horribly inefficient, they are a common practice that allow Spammers 
            to get mail out to people who have not provided their names or 
            addresses.
Your best bet is simply to delete such email from your 
            inbox if you find any.
==========
Regrettably, all of us are victims of this behavior.
Excite@Home 
            does not condone these activities and is active in pursuing 
            solutions, including supporting the development of new laws and 
            regulations to stem email Spamming.
Excite@Home is not responsible 
            for this unfortunate activity, and largely cannot stop it from 
            occurring when it originates from domains off of the Excite@Home 
            Network.
We can and will, however, take actions against Excite@Home 
            users who utilize any of our email products as the launching pad for 
            Spam directed towards others, whether those prospective Spam 
            recipients be Excite@Home customers or not.
Sending Spam from any 
            Excite@Home domain is a serious breach of our Terms of Service that 
            can lead to immediate closure of the sender's account.
Finally, Excite@Home does occasionally send outbound email 
            communications to our customers - and we hope you never think of it 
            as Spam.
To ensure that this is the case, we have strong policies in 
            place that allow our customers to control the delivery of this 
            content, or to prevent it altogether if that is your preference.
For 
            information about the controls that we make available to you, please 
            see the information about unsubscribing 
            from Excite@Home outbound emailings shown below.
==========
What Personally Identifiable Information of 
                  yours is collected
As always, we are committed to making your Webshots experience enjoyable and safe.
When you download our software, our photos,
    register for our online services, send our electronic greetings, or other
    email, 
            the information you provide to us is used only to customize your
    experience and to deliver 
            email notifications to you (or people you designate as your
    recipients).
The 
            names and email addresses you give us 
            are NOT sold, compiled into any type of mailing list, or otherwise 
            used for any type of email solicitation.
If you choose to explore Exite@Home-integrated services, such as 
            Address Book, we may at times ask you to submit information such as 
            your name or email address, or to share your interests and hobbies 
            with us.
You never have to answer these questions, and you can 
            decline this exchange of information on any site on the Internet - 
            not just ours - at any time.
==========
However, if you should choose to 
            withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you 
            with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this 
            information, such as a personalized stock portfolio, a sweepstakes 
            entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes to people 
            who visit our network.
If you are an Excite@Home broadband cable service customer, you 
            are electing to use a paid service that requires you to supply 
            certain information to establish the billing relationship.
For 
            instance, your name, address, phone number, and potentially your 
            credit card number must be provided to initiate service.
==========
That 
            information is only available to authorized Excite@Home personnel 
            for installing, maintaining, and billing the Excite@Home service.
When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as 
            Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically 
            transmits some information to Excite@Home every time you access 
            content on one of our sites, whether accessing it from the 
            Excite@Home cable Internet access service or through another 
            Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Examples of such information 
            include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the 
            "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you 
            are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site.
All of this information is collected by Excite@Home and is used to 
            help improve our offerings to you.
==========
For instance, from this 
            information we determined that few of our customers use older 
            browser versions.
Because of this we recently decided to enhance the 
            quality of content available to all of our customers by using the 
            advanced features of HTML that cannot be accessed from those older 
            browser versions.
All of the information that is automatically 
            submitted to us by your browser is considered Anonymous 
            Information.
To enable many of the features available within the Excite@Home 
            Network, we will assign "cookies" to your Internet browser (such as 
            Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer).
==========
A cookie is a 
            small text file that contains a unique identification number stored 
            on your computer.
Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out 
            the identity of any user.
This unique identification number 
            automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our 
            computers whenever you interact on one of our Internet domains.
When 
            you visit our site, a cookie in effect says to our server computers 
            "Hello, I'm browser #655.
What do you do just for me?"
==========
Every Web 
            page that you access that includes advertising or content served 
            from the Excite@Home Network will have the contents of your cookie 
            reported in our server logs.
But only when you agree to provide Personally 
            Identifiable Information directly to an Excite@Home 
            branded service, such as through registration, will we be able 
            to know anything about you other than the random number that our 
            server computers originally assign to your browser.
There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are used, and 
            what they can do.
Cookies only contain information that the server 
            computer "knew" in the first place, and can only be read by the 
            serving domain that placed them.
For instance, Yahoo! utilizes 
            cookies, but Excite@Home's servers can't read their contents nor can 
            Yahoo!'s servers read ours.
Cookies are an essential part of how the 
            Internet works today, and allow server computers to recognize your 
            computer's browser when you return.
==========
If you have ever gone to a Web 
            page that automatically provides personalized content without you 
            having to "sign in," such as your own stock portfolio, this is 
            almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie.
Since cookies are 
            only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no 
            ability to search your computer for other information, or transmit 
            it to anyone.
Cookies are part of the technology implemented by your Web 
            browser.
But don't just take our word for it - read what the 
            companies who wrote the browsers have to say!

What organization is collecting the 
                  information 
The data you provide in any 
            Internet domain of the Excite@Home Network, including http://www.excite.com/, is 
            collected by the At Home Corporation.
Excite@Home is a wholly 
            owned-subsidiary of this corporation.

==========
If you are a user of the Excite@Home broadband cable service, you 
            have a second, separate, relationship with your Excite@Home cable 
            partner that is directly providing services to you.
These companies 
            receive the information you supply to Excite@Home to create your 
            account, but do not receive subsequent Personally 
            Identifiable Information from us regarding you or your 
            activities online.
The cable partners offering you Excite@Home 
            services also have independent policies relating to the protections 
            they employ to safeguard your information.
These policies are 
            provided to you by your cable operator when your cable service (or 
            cable Internet service) is installed, and in the United States are 
            sent by law to you annually thereafter, for as long as you remain a 
            customer (practices will vary in other locations according to local 
            law).
These various policies are outside of Excite@Home's control 
            and questions you may have regarding them should be made directly to 
            your cable service.
==========
How the information is 
                used
Our services have been designed to enable Excite@Home to provide 
            personalized content to those customers who wish to receive it.
The 
            majority of the services that are provided for free through the 
            Excite@Home Network are the result of advertising revenues.
Our 
            ability to provide enhanced services and content to our customers is 
            dependent on our ability to provide venues for our advertising 
            partners that reach specific demographic segments of our customer 
            base.
Generally, advertisers have little interest in reaching a 
            specific customer of our services - and as a matter of policy we 
            provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you or any other 
            specific customer unless you request that contact.
Instead, our 
            advertising partners have the need to reach customers who share 
            common demographic characteristics such as a specific gender or age 
            range.
==========
For instance, certain products are more often purchased by 
            men then by women and therefore when advertising those products, in 
            this example the advertiser would prefer to target their messages 
            just to men.
The better job Excite@Home does in providing a 
            mechanism for advertisers to reach specific sub-segments of our 
            users, the more revenue we can generate from advertising and that 
            ultimately is what allows you the consumer to get to the wealth of 
            free content that is available on Excite@Home's various services.
Importantly, at no time is your Personally 
            Identifiable Information used to determine what advertising you 
            receive nor do we use it to determine what type of advertising any 
            other customer of Excite@Home will receive.
Below is a description of the uses of the information that we 
            collect and how our visitors and advertisers benefit from these 
            action:
            

We provide personalized content in the form of news, 
              horoscopes, advertisements, weather reports, stock portfolios, 
              movies, television listings, and more to our Members.
==========
We pay attention to what our customers do and do not use on 
              our service and modify our content appropriately.
We match the patterns of usage that our consumers exhibit on 
              any Web site where we serve advertising - over 2,000 distinct 
              Internet domains - to create "imputed profiles" about our 
              anonymous customers.
The creation of an imputed profile allows the 
              Excite@Home Network to statistically model the demographic 
              characteristics of an otherwise anonymous customer, without ever 
              knowing that anonymous customer's name or any other Personally 
              Identifiable Information about them.
These imputed profiles 
              are used to target advertising - primarily banners - to those 
              anonymous customers, both on Excite@Home 
              Network domains and any of the other Internet domains where we 
              serve advertising.
Through the use of imputed profiles, Excite@Home can surface 
              advertising to our customers that is more likely to be for 
              products they would want, and sell that advertising in the 
              marketplace for a higher price.
This is essential to our ability 
              to provide high quality content to our customers for free.
Excite@Home never matches "Who you are" with "Where you've been" 
              on the Internet because we do not use personal data 
              characteristics such as your name, address or phone number to 
              create these imputed profiles but rather use primary demographic 
              characteristics such as your age or gender.
Finally, imputed 
              profiles present no privacy risk to our customers because they are 
              worthless to third parties; since any potential third party would 
              be unable to read the cookies that we set on our domains, only 
              Excite@Home can create value from these imputed profiles.
We provide advertisements that support our customers' specific 
              requests for information through keyword searches and editorial 
              content.
Do a search on "cars," for instance, and you'll usually 
              see a banner advertisement from an automobile company.
==========
We develop summary - but not individual - reports for our 
              advertisers.
An example of a summary report might be "12,000 
              people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today, and of those people, 
              35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports."
Our 
              advertisers, who make it possible for you to use Excite@Home for 
              free, need this information to determine how effective their 
              advertising investments are.
We never tell our advertisers who it 
              was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, unless you have 
              specifically told us it is acceptable to do so.
==========
If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest, we'll use the 
              information you supplied to contact you.
We'll probably also 
              congratulate you!
Through our DeliverE email service, we will send registrants 
              of the Excite@Home Network outbound email communications on 
              information we think they will find useful, including information 
              about new products and services from selected partners.
It is our 
              policy to never send messages to Members who have asked us not to 
              do so, either at initial registration or later through an 
              unsubscribe process.
In every email from any company or Web site 
              of the Excite@Home Network, we will remind you of your option to 
              change your preferences regarding receipt of future email 
              communications.
Please see the information about unsubscribing 
              from Excite@Home outbound emailings shown below for more 
              information.
Finally, if we believe that Excite@Home property or an 
              individual's safety or security is at risk, we will disclose this 
              information to proper court or law enforcement agencies.
==========
If you are providing us Personally 
            Identifiable Information, it will only be used within the Excite@Home 
            Network Internet domains unless you choose to allow third party 
            data sharing (by opting in for such distribution during the 
            registration process).
Should you choose to provide your information 
            to third parties, Excite@Home will share aspects of your information 
            with our valued partners.
Some of these transactions will include 
            financial payment to Excite@Home for the information provided but 
            are only undertaken with companies whose privacy practices are 
            consistent with the principles established within this policy and 
            with whom Excite@Home believes that a product that truly benefits 
            our customers can be promoted.
All of our partners help contribute 
            towards many of the free services available on the Excite@Home 
            Network.
Although unlikely, Excite@Home may be required by law enforcement 
            or judicial authorities to provide Personally 
            Identifiable Information the appropriate governmental 
            authorities.
If requested by law enforcement or judicial 
            authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the 
            appropriate documentation.
==========
Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect 
            information about you when you view or click on their advertising or 
            content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as 
            described above).
Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control 
            this collection of information - but we can control which companies 
            are allowed to place such advertising on our site.
Excite@Home is 
            leading the creation of industry standards of acceptable practice 
            for what is known as "Third party ad serving," and once these 
            standards are established will only accept advertising from third 
            party firms that adhere to those rules of conduct.
In the interim, 
            as the consumer you should contact these advertisers or content 
            providers that place information on the Excite@Home Network directly 
            if you have any questions about their use of the information they 
            potentially collect.
It should be noted that anyone placing 
            advertising on our Web sites can only collect Anonymous 
            Information about you unless you actively provide Personally 
            Identifiable Information to them.
==========
Information that you provide while using products such as Excite 
            Message Boards and Excite Chat is available for all to see.
Discretion should be used in entering Personally 
            Identifiable Information within such forums, as it may be 
            collected by third parties, and this is, for instance, a leading 
            source of unwanted email Spam.
The Excite@Home Network does not actively associate the message 
            content entered by our customers in Excite Mail, Excite Message 
            Boards, or Excite Chat products with those customers' registration 
            information.
==========
Our server computers will retain this information, 
            however; and it is potentially available for distribution to third 
            parties - most obviously law-enforcement agencies acting under 
            subpoena power, per the terms of this section of our Privacy Policy.
We do not use this information to target any advertising to our 
            customers, nor is it ever willingly distributed to any third party, 
            such as an advertiser, except if subpoenaed.
And finally, the Excite@Home Network does not control the 
            information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains 
            other than those Excite@Home 
            Network Internet domains that are part of the Excite@Home 
            Network itself.
We do, however, encourage our co-branding partners 
            to adopt privacy policies similar to this one and to become 
            licensees of TRUSTe, and we have been relatively successful to date 
            in gaining coverts: Look for the TRUSTe logo wherever you go on the 
            Internet!
What choices are available to you regarding 
                  collection, use, and distribution of the 
                  information
The Excite@Home Network does offer you the ability to control the 
            email communications we make to you.
It is our intention to give you 
            as much control over our relationship as possible.
==========
First, as mentioned earlier, the consumer always has the final 
            word on whether Excite@Home - or any Internet company - knows who 
            you are.
It is your choice to share Personally 
            Identifiable Information with Excite@Home and we encourage you 
            to consider only sharing information with any site on the Internet 
            if you receive true value in exchange for that information transfer 
            and if you respect the privacy practices of the firm.
If you do choose to share Personally 
            Identifiable Information with Excite@Home, you can control 
            whether we contact you or share the information with third parties, 
            either through declarations you make at the time you share 
            information with us, or through updates to your information in the 
            Excite@Home 
            Member Services area.
Any time information is requested from you 
            on an Excite@Home 
            Network Internet domain, you should see a TRUSTe logo that links 
            to our Privacy Policy and a clear indication of what your 
            information distribution choices are.
==========
Excite@Home will always give 
            you a chance to unsubscribe to any email communication from us - 
            clear directions for doing so will appear in any email message we 
            send to you.
At times, the Excite@Home Network may enter into cobranding 
            arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in question may 
            be present for contact from these firms as well.
Their opt-out 
            features are specific to each organization, but you should never 
            receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated 
            that it is acceptable.
All email from the Excite@Home Network, or 
            from cobrand partners who gain your permission to send you 
            commercial email, will include an opportunity to opt out of future 
            communications.
The Excite@Home Network does reserve the right to send a one-time 
            registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert 
            messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes that 
            may impact their ability to use a service they have previously 
            signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.
==========
An example 
            of a Service Alert message would be notification of the impending 
            closing of an account that is believed to be abandoned.
Additionally, Excite@Home reserves the right to send its broadband 
            cable service customers periodic postal mail and/or email regarding 
            administrative topics, for example, changes in pricing or operating 
            policies.
And finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if 
            compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has 
            been a violation of our Terms of Service.
Excite@Home is retaining these rights because in limited cases we 
            feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or 
            regarding matters which will be important to you.
These rights do 
            not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if 
            you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of 
            communications are rare.
==========
What kind of security procedures are in place 
                  to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of 
                  information under the company's 
              control
The Excite@Home Network operates secure data networks protected 
            by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.
Our 
            security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced 
            as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the 
            information provided by our customers.
Even your registration 
            account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers - 
            no one in the company could tell you what your password is even if 
            you asked!
Any other particularly sensitive information, such as a 
            customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, 
            is also encrypted prior to transmission.
==========
You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of 
            your Excite@Home Member Name and password.
As was stated above, we 
            can't even use your password unless it has been encrypted first.
Please take care to store you Excite@Home Member Name separately 
            from your account password, or better yet, choose a password that 
            you don't need to write down at all.
