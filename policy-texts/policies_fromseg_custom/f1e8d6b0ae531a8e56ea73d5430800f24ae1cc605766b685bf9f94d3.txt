The policy of the University of Minnesota is to respect the privacy of all web site visitors to the extent permitted by law.
Although all University web sites are encouraged to do so, the following web sites must select, adhere to and notify visitors of their information collection policy by including a "Privacy Statement" on their website.
Official University sites
All sites that collect online information from visitors
All sites that track user actions
Units and individuals responsible for web sites may select the standard or customized "Privacy Statements" included within this policy, or they may create one of their own.
Any such statement must be written to assure web site users that the University will:
Inform visitors about information collected, its intended use, and options for using the site without providing such information.
==========
Follow laws governing the collection of online information.
Notify visitors of their options concerning accessing information collected.
Establish appropriate security measures for any personally identifiable information collected.
==========
Notification of visitors requires that each page of the web site display a link to a "Privacy Statement", display the statement itself, or cause the statement to be displayed the first time a user visits the site, and each time the statement changes thereafter.
The privacy statement should include a reference and link to this University policy and contact information for visitors with questions about the specific site policy, data collection, or data security.
Official University web sites, sites that collect information from visitors online, and those that track user actions must post an online privacy statement by September 2001.
Use by other University web pages not included in the three subcategories above is encouraged.
==========
Sites conducting web-based research are subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).
The IRB shall develop its own guidelines for the use of web sites in research and shall apply those guidelines to research projects requiring IRB review.
Exclusions
This policy does not address issues related to internal security measures of electronic communication or those related to conducting research activities on the WWW.
Special Situations
If private information (Defined by the Minnesota Data Practices Act) is requested from individuals, they must be informed of certain information that is collected.

Stat.
13.04 subd.
2)
As an ever-increasing number of users interact with the University and its units through web sites, technology provides increasing opportunities to gather information about these individuals.
While much information-gathering is consensual and for specific purposes, web users are discovering that some web sites gather information without the users' knowledge or consent.
This information may be used for purposes contrary to the users' interests, and over time this process may erode users' confidence in using the web.
==========
The University of Minnesota is committed to informing online users of the data collection and storage policies of its sites as it fulfills its primary mission of teaching, research and outreach.
This policy establishes standards for informing users whether and when the University collects information electronically via the WWW.
The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act - Minn.
Stat.
13.01 et seq. governs the classification and distribution of public and private information collected by public organizations.
==========
By amendment in 2003, the Data Practices Act also requires that websites maintained by public entities display privacy notices to visitors, and establishes specific language that must be included in the notices.
Customized versions of privacy statements may be necessary to meet the specialized needs of groups within the University such as students, health sciences or business units.
In support of this policy, the following procedures are included:
