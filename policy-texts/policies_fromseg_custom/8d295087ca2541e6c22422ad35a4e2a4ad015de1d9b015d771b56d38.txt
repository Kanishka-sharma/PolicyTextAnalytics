Subject to legal, business, or contract requirements, you can withdraw your consent to our collection, use and sharing of information at any time by giving us reasonable notice.
However, withdrawing your consent may limit or prevent us from providing you with, or being able to continue to provide you with, specific products and services.
For example, if you choose not to provide us with your SIN, we will not be able to provide you with any product where the collection of a SIN is required under tax law, such as a registered product like an RRSP.
==========
In particular, during our relationship with you, we provide you with the following privacy choices:
Social Insurance Number (SIN)
Including your SIN in a credit bureau request is the best way to make sure the credit bureau information accurately refers to you.
This use of your SIN is optional and, if you choose not to give your permission, this by itself will not prevent you from qualifying for products and services.
We only use your SIN as part of credit bureau requests when qualifying you for products and services and do not use your SIN on an ongoing basis as described in the previous credit bureau section.
Marketing
Subject to applicable law, CIBC may offer you products and services of CIBC or of CIBC Foreign Affiliates, including special promotions, which may be of interest to you.

==========
We may also, from time to time, communicate with you to ask whether you wish to update your marketing preferences to help ensure that our records are up-to-date and reflect your current preferences.
