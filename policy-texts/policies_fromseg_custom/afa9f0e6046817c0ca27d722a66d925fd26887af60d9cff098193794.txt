Personally Identifiable Information

The URLs we collect through the Service sometimes contain personal information about you.
For example, when you enter information on a Web page (e.g., when you complete an online registration form or sign up for a contest), the operator of the website may insert that information into its URL for that or the next page.
==========
This information often appears after a question mark ("?")
in the URL, although it can appear in other places.
This means that your name, your address, your email address, or similar information you might consider private or personally identifiable which you enter into a Web page sometimes becomes part of a URLs that is then transmitted to IBIS and automatically stored in IBIS databases.
This can also occur with words, topics, products, or phrases you enter into search engines whether those engines are provided by the Service itself or found elsewhere on the Web while using the Service.
IBIS has no control over what information third party websites put into their URLs or where they put it, but any information in each URL is collected and stored by IBIS when you are using the Service.
==========
We collect information about the products you view or search for on the World Wide Web.
This allows us to provide more detailed product and comparative shopping information.
The information we collect includes product codes (such as ISBN numbers for books), product names, and other identifiers that appear in both the text and the URLs of Web pages that you view.
The product information that IBIS gathers is logged together with your IP address, IBIS cookie number, the names of IBIS business partners that might have additional information about the particular product, and the date and time, in a single data string for each Web page you visit.
These strings, which we call "shopping paths," may also contain personally identifiable information.
==========
IBIS transmits the product descriptions (without your IBIS cookie number or IP address) to its business partners, who return relevant product information and/or comparison shopping information to the Service for your use.
If you email IBIS, we may store copies of such email or similar communications between you and IBIS.
This can result in the collection of your email address or other personally identifiable information you may have in your email text, addresses, or other fields, as well as the collection of the your IP address, the Internet or other routing of your communication, and the date and time of your communication.
==========

If you submit any information to the IBIS website, the content you submit, the URL that you reviewed, your chosen public nickname, your IBIS cookie number, and a record locator number may be logged together by IBIS.
All transmissions between you and IBIS, including emails, URLs, cookie identification numbers, usage paths, shopping path information, and any personally identifiable information they might contain, pass through many third party machines, operating systems, programs, browsers, Web servers, networks, routers, Ethernet switches, ISPs, proxy servers, intranets, the public telephone systems, or other devices, any of which may create activity logs containing such transmissions.
==========
The Service and IBIS website provide links to various features, services, and Web pages provided solely by our business partners or other organizations.
The links take you to pages provided solely by those entities, although sometimes the pages are co-branded with the IBIS logo.
You will be able to tell when another entity is involved with providing features, services, or Web pages, and any information about your interaction with those Web pages, including which pages and advertisements you view and any search terms or other information you enter, will be received by that other business.
==========

Please review any terms of use and privacy policies of those other businesses to learn about their data collection and data use practices.
==========
Further, our business partners may post advertisements on pages co-branded with the IBIS logo.
Those advertisements are transmitted to your browser directly by the advertiser or the business partner, not by IBIS, and those advertisers may transmit a cookie to your hard drive and may collect information about you.
If an advertiser or its ad server has previously placed a cookie on your machine, it may recognize the cookie and learn you have visited our co-branded Web page or used our Service even though you do not click on the advertisement.

IP addresses are further used to help determine the number of IBIS users.
This demographic information may also be used by IBIS to analyze aggregate Web usage behavior.
We use Web usage paths to build the Related Links functionality.
We use shopping paths to build the functionality of our product information and comparison shopping features.
We use both usage and shopping paths and purchase information for aggregate research and reports.
==========

IBIS IS FREE TO USE SUCH INFORMATION ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS.
How does IBIS share the information it collects?
IBIS does not attempt to determine the identity of its users or correlate their email addresses with their Web usage paths or shopping information.
Except as described below, IBIS does not intentionally disclose personally identifying information collected from any user to any third party without the user's consent.
We provide "stripped" usage path information, demographic information, and shopping path information to researchers.

Such analyses are used in research and commercial reports provided to third parties.
Before providing the usage path information, we "strip" from the URLs a portion of your IP address and the information that appears after the "?
==========
," with limited exceptions for certain types of search terms.
Before providing the shopping path information to researchers, we strip a portion of your IP address from the data string.
If you use the search functions provided on either the IBIS website or on the Service software, we transmit your search term and IP address to a search engine.
We disclose any information we possess in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements, and such information might be used by the receiving party to determine your identity, your Web usage and online shopping behavior, or other things about you.
==========
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as technical support services.
To perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to IBIS databases and servers, which may contain personally identifying information about users.
What kind of security measures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under IBIS control?
IBIS uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect its databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data.
These risks, however, cannot be completely eliminated and IBIS therefore cannot guarantee complete security.
IBIS also segregates certain personally identifiable information provided by you.
==========
Any email address you chose to provide is stored in a database.
Your usage paths are stored on a separate database and server that can be accessed only by a limited number of IBIS employees.
Shopping paths are stored in a database separate from usage paths, email addresses, and demographic information.
Also, any demographic information you chose to provide is stored, along with your IBIS cookie number and the name of any advertisement that brought you to the IBIS download, in a database separate from email addresses, Web usage path information, and shopping path information.
IBIS prohibits its employees from using any of this information to determine your identity.
If you send us an email, you should know that email is not necessarily secure against interception.
==========
So, if your communication includes sensitive information like your bank account, charge card, or social security number, and you prefer not to use one of our secure online complaint forms, contact us by postal mail or telephone rather than email.
