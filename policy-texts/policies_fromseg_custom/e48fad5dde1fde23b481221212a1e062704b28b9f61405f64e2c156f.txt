At IBM, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information.
In general, you can visit IBM on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.
==========
There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address.
It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.
If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
==========
We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us.
We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.
==========
We have implemented these practices for the IBM Home Page (www.ibm.com).
We are also instructing our employees around the world to include information on privacy practices everywhere information is collected on the IBM Web, tailored to what that portion of the site does and reflecting the practices outlined here.
The IBM site contains links to other Web sites.
IBM is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site.
A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.
Some IBM pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return to our site.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.
For more information, please see "How to work with Cookies".
IBM is also supporting the development of some technologies that will let you manage and control the release of your personal information wherever you go on the Internet.
From time to time we'll be sharing information with you about efforts underway in organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium and TRUSTe.
If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, you can contact us at askibm@vnet.ibm.com.
