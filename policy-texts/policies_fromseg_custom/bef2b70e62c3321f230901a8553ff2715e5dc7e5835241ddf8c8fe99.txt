CBS Local is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you.
With your consent.
You may be asked to consent to have your contact information shared with third-party business partners.
For example, CBS Local Web Sites sometimes run contests with prizes provided by an advertiser (e.g. a contest with a prize provided by the advertiser).
When entering such a contest you may be asked if the third party may contact you to provide information about their products or services or to provide you with special promotional opportunities.
==========
Other Users.
Certain CBS Local Web Sites may provide services which allow users to create and RSVP to events and gatherings.
Users and/or guests invited to the same events or gatherings as you may be able to view the personal information that you provide through your account and make public.
In addition, other users may choose to email you.
However, to ensure your privacy, we will not display or give out your email address or any other contact information to other users unless otherwise indicated in this Privacy Policy.
For these services, emails will be transmitted through a “double blind” email system, which hides the email addresses of both the sender and recipient of the email messages to protect the privacy of both the sender and receiver.
When using the double-blind system, it is up to you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your email address or any other information to other users through private communications.
==========
Authorized third-party service providers.
We share your information with third-party vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, and data processing.
These third parties are allowed to use your contact information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose.

Sweepstakes, contests, or promotions.
When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotion, your information may be disclosed to sponsors and third parties who help administer the promotion, including in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment.
Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list.
Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing the sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law
Co-Branded Partners.

You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner.
In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner, or we may share your information with the Co-Branded Partner.
==========
Please note that the Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy may apply to its use of your information

Privacy Protections for Children
Most CBS Local Web Sites are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13.
Some CBS Local Web Sites may ask for a birth date to ensure that they are not collecting information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with information collected from children under 18.
In those instances where a CBS Local Web Site has actual knowledge that it collects information from children, or offers a service directed toward children, it will comply with applicable laws, including the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
To read about our privacy policy for children under the age of 13, please see the Children’s Privacy Policy.
User-Generated Content
Some CBS Local Web Sites enable users to submit their own content for contests, blogs, videos, message boards, and other functions.
Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial, and other information in a submission.
We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies
Cookies
Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored in separate files within your computer’s Internet browser.
Cookies are accessed and recorded by the web sites you visit, and by the companies that show advertisements on web sites, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online.
CBS Local Web Sites use cookies for the following general purposes:
To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting one of our Web Sites.
For example, if you register on a CBS Local Web Site, the Web Site may save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit.
To help us customize the content and advertisements you are shown while visiting CBS Local Web Sites and potentially other web sites online.
==========
Please read about our online advertising to learn more about our efforts to show you relevant advertising.
To help measure and research the effectiveness of our interactive online content, features, advertisements, and other communications.
CBS Local Web Sites may also allow third parties to place their own cookies within your browser in order to serve you with relevant advertising online.
Please note that we do not share contact information with these third parties and CBS Local can only access cookies that we set on your browser, not the cookies sent to you by other companies.
For more information about the use of cookies by third parties for advertising purposes, please read about third-party online advertising on CBS Local Web Sites.
You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.
(Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)
It is up to you whether to allow us or third parties to send you cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some or all of a CBS Local Web Site.
Web Beacons and Other Technologies
We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use of the CBS Local Web Sites.
==========
Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.
We use web beacons to improve your experience on our Web Sites, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers.
Our web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).
CBS Local Web Sites also may include third-party web beacons so that these third parties may receive auditing, research, and reporting information about advertisements viewed on the CBS Local Web Sites.
Third parties do not have access to your contact information in connection with their use of web beacons.
Mobile Devices
Certain mobile devices contain unique identifiers that can be used, for example, to identify the physical location of such devices.
==========
Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data when used to transmit a telephone call or text message.
CBS Local Web Sites may collect, use, transmit, process, and maintain unique identifiers, caller ID data, location-based data, and similar information when you rely on mobile devices, including to provide the services you request, tell you about offers we think you will value, and improve your experience on CBS Local Web Sites.
CBS Local Web Sites also may require collection of your mobile phone number in order for you to participate in certain services or features and that number may be associated with such information.
CBS Local Online Advertising
In order to customize your experience on the CBS Local Web Sites, we may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about the content and advertisements you view on our Web Sites.
==========
Based on this information, and other information we may collect about you, we try to infer your interests and show content and advertising that is more relevant to you.
For example, if you access an article about computers on one CBS Local Web Site, we may show you a computer-related advertisement on another CBS Local Web Site based on your apparent interests.
We also may receive information from third parties about you and your activities on other sites for the purpose of serving relevant advertisements to you on CBS Local Web Sites.
For example, if you access an article on a third-party site about computers, we may use that information to serve you with a computer-related advertisement on a CBS Local Web Site.
Please note that we may share information about our users with advertisers so that they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the CBS Local Web Sites.
For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.
These online-advertising efforts across CBS Local Web Sites do not result in you seeing more advertisements, just more relevant advertising, and they allow us to provide you with free content and services on our Web Sites.
==========
We hope you value our efforts to show you content and advertising that more closely reflects your interests.
Some of the advertisements you see on CBS Local Web Sites are delivered by third parties.
To learn more, please read about third-party online advertising.
Third-Party Online Advertising

We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit the sites on which this Children’s Privacy Policy is posted.
The following guidelines supplement our general Privacy Policy and follow the rules set by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other applicable laws.

Information We Collect
Children can enjoy content and features on CBS Local Web Sites without directly providing contact information.
However, children who wish to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and certain other special activities may need to provide information such as first name, user name, password, email address, date of birth, city and state of residence, and gender.
In the course of participating in interactive features such as chat rooms and message boards, a child may provide us with additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her postings.
==========
Some information, including information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, may be collected automatically.

If we collect, use, or disclose contact information collected from a child, we will provide notice and obtain parental consent in accordance with applicable law.
We do not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child’s providing more contact information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
Use of Information
We use the information we collect consistent with the services requested by the child.
==========
For example, we may use information provided by the child to:
Send a newsletter, electronic card, and other communication requested by the child;
Enable a child’s participation in certain interactive features such as games, contests, message boards, chat rooms, song requests, and online scrolling tickers; and
Respond to correspondence sent by the child.
In addition, we may use a parent’s contact information to communicate with the parent regarding the child’s activities on CBS Local Web Sites.
For example, if a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, we may use the parent’s contact information to conduct prize fulfillment.
==========
Disclosure of Information
Information collected from children will be disclosed in the same ways described in the “Disclosure of Information” section of our general Privacy Policy.
Third parties who receive contact information collected by CBS Local have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of that information.
Parents have the option not to consent to the disclosure of their child’s contact information to third parties.
Parents may consent to CBS Local’s collection and use of their child’s contact information while refusing to permit the disclosure of that information to third parties.
Parents’ Choices and Access to Children’s Information
Parents may review the contact information we have collected from their child, refuse to permit us to collect further contact information from their child, and request that any contact information we have collected be deleted from our records.

You may also send your request to the postal address listed below.
To protect your child’s safety, we ask for proof of your identification.

Why are you updating your Privacy Policy?
==========
We recently joined together with our parent corporation, CBS Corporation and certain of its other subsidiaries to offer all of our web sites’ users access to a wider array of content and interactive experiences.
We recognize the importance of providing the users of CBS Local Web Sites a Privacy Policy that is consistent with those of other CBS Local Web Sites and other web sites of business units of CBS Corporation and that is consistent with a set of core Privacy Principles followed by those companies.
Have you made any substantively material changes to the Privacy Policy?
No, we have not made any substantively material changes to our Privacy Policy.
We have simplified the policy, made it uniform across CBS Local Web Sites, and made it easier to follow.
What is a key difference with the old Privacy Policy?
One of the key differences is that our new Privacy Policy is provided in a layered format, allowing you to read highlights of our practices upfront with links to additional information about our privacy practices.

Will you share my contact information with third parties?
Like other businesses, we share contact information (such as name and email address) with vendors who process credit card transactions, with business partners who co-sponsor our Web Sites, and when we have consent from our users.
For more information, click here.
==========
Can you give me an example of when you will share my information with third parties?
If you enter a sweepstakes that is jointly sponsored by a third party, we will share your contact information with that third party.
Also, if you seek to download a free song from a band or listen to a free stream of a band, we might ask you to consent to have your contact information shared with third parties who may contact you about information concerning that band’s appearances.
This allows us to offer you valuable content for free.
==========
Does CBS Local share contact information with other CBS Local Web Sites or web sites owned by CBS Corporation?
As CBS Corporations continues to expand its online offerings, we will share information with both CBS Local Web Sites and other web sites owned by our parent, CBS Corporation, so we can better inform our users about products and services in which they may be interested.
It is up to you as to whether you want to hear about special offers from us or from other business units owned by CBS Corporation.
==========
You can choose not to receive such marketing emails when you register with us, in any such email we send, or by contacting us.
Do you use my data for advertising on CBS Local Web Sites?
Like other web sites, we are able to offer free content and services through the revenue we receive from advertising on our Web Sites.
We hope you value the advertising you see on our Web Sites, and we may use some data about you to tailor advertisements to your apparent interests.
For example, if you visit a CBS Local Web Site and view articles about computers, we may serve you with a computer-related advertisement when you visit another CBS Local Web Site.
This advertising does not result in you seeing more ads; rather, it just means the ads you would otherwise see are more relevant.
