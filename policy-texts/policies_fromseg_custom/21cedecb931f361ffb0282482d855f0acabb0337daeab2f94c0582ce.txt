==========
Cookies & Log Files:
Like most web sites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage.
A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer and allows us to recognize you as a user when you return to FastCompany.com using the same computer and web browser.
If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will be able to use the public areas of the FastCompany.com Website but will not be able to become a Member of the Fast Company Community.
==========
Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your FastCompany.com account.
The next time you visit the FastCompany.com Website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing Member so you will not need to log in before using the service.
In order to access or change any of your private information, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.
Additionally, if you log out of FastCompany.comyou will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account.
==========
Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to FastCompany.com.
Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit FastCompany.com  we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave FastCompany.com.
We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP.
This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve FastCompany.com.
==========
The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third parties without your permission, except when required by law.
Web Beacons:
We allow ad networks, to serve advertisements to FastCompany.com users.
Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
FastCompany.com may “target” some ads to Members that fit a certain general profile — for example, “product managers in Texas.”
We do NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.
==========
To deliver these ads properly, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by FastCompany.com so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
These web beacons may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads.
You will never see additional ads as a result of being a Fast Company Community Member or a FastCompany .
com user.
==========
In addition, tFastCompany.com uses the technology of DoubleClick Inc. to serve ads only when you visit  FastCompany.com.
DoubleClick may use non-personal information, such as your state or zip code, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you while you visit FastCompany.com.
In the course of serving advertisements to FastCompany.com, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, please click here [link to http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx].
==========
Note that when you opt-out of the DoubleClick cookie a special DoubleClick “opt-out” cookie will replace the DoubleClick Ad cookie.
If you ever delete the cookies on your browser you will need to again opt-out of the DoubleClick Ad Cookie.
If you opt-out you will lose the potential benefit of receiving ads that are more targeted to your interests.
==========

Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to become Members of the Fast Company Community.
