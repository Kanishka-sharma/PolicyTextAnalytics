==========
Agreement.
Your agreement ("Agreement") with Sprint Spectrum L.P. and any of its affiliates doing business as Sprint providing PCS Services ("Services") to you is made up of these Terms and Conditions of Service ("Terms") and the Service Plan that we agree to provide you.
Your "Service Plan" is described in our marketing materials, and includes the terms, rates and features we set for that Service Plan.
In the agreement, we use the words "we," "us," "our" or "Sprint" to refer to Sprint Spectrum L.P. and its affiliates doing business as Sprint.
You accept the agreement when you activate PCS Services or make any attempt to use our PCS Services (for example, attempting to place any call while on or roaming off the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network, using data services, etc.).
==========
We may change the Agreement at any time by giving you prior notice.
Any changes to the Agreement are effective when we publish them.
If you use our Services or make any payment to us on or after the effective date of the changes, you accept the changes.
If we change a material term of the Agreement and that change has a material adverse effect on you, you may terminate the Agreement without an early termination fee by calling 1-888-211-4727 within 30 days after the invoice date of the first invoice you receive after the changes go into effect.
==========
You understand and agree that taxes, Universal Service fees and other charges imposed by the government or based on government calculations may increase or decrease on a monthly basis, and that this paragraph does not apply to any increases in such taxes, Universal Service fees and other charges.
Provision of Service.
==========
Your purchase of a PCS Phone or other equipment does not mean that we must provide Services to you.
We may decide not to provide Services to you for any lawful reason.
We may request that you provide us with any information we reasonably require to determine whether you qualify for Services.
==========
Services in some areas are managed and provided under contract with Sprint by independent affiliates with access to the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network.
Some Services may not be available or may operate differently in certain affiliate markets or other areas.
==========
Credit Verification.
You must have and maintain satisfactory credit to receive and continue to receive Services.
We will verify your credit before agreeing to provide Services to you and we may verify your credit at any time while we provide Services to you.
Credit verification may include a review of credit reports that we receive from credit bureaus.
If at any time we determine, in our sole discretion, that payment for Services may not be made when due, we may suspend Services and require that you provide payment on account or a guarantee of payment before we resume Services.
==========
Service Plan.
You may be eligible for a fixed length PCS Service Plan ("Term Service Plan") or for a month-to-month Service Plan ("Non-Term Service Plan").
We determine the Service Plan for which you qualify.
Except as permitted by the Agreement, you must maintain service with us on your Term Service Plan for the minimum term 
associated with that Term Service Plan.
We may offer non-identical Service Plans to 
different individuals or entities.
==========
Services and coverage under some Service Plans may be more limited than available under other Service Plans.
Your Service Plan sets out the charges for Services and is your Service Plan until that Service Plan is changed, you switch to a different Service Plan, or your Services terminate.
Based on your credit rating or other factors, we may require that you make a deposit, prepayment, or a series of deposits or prepayments, or be subject to an account spending limit, before Services are activated or maintained.
==========
Changing Service Plans.
If you are on a Non-Term Service Plan, you may change to a different Service Plan for which you qualify.
==========
Any change is effective at the start of your next full invoicing cycle unless otherwise specified by us at the time that you place your change order.
If you change or add a different Service Plan or service feature and the change is effective prior to the start of your next full invoicing cycle, you will be invoiced a prorated amount.
We may require a service charge for implementing any change directed by you in addition to the charges associated with the Service Plan or optional service features you select.
If you are on a Term Service Plan and you want to change your service plan, you may be required to accept a new Term Service Plan and we may require you to pay the early termination fee set out in your Service Plan or other fee.
Termination.
==========
Non-Term Service Plan.
If you are on a Non-Term Service Plan, you may terminate Services at any time by giving us notice.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we may terminate Services at any time, with or without notice.

Termination by either of us may be with or without cause.
Termination.
Term Service Plan.
EXCEPT AS PERMITTED BY THE AGREEMENT, IF YOU TERMINATE YOUR TERM SERVICE PLAN BEFORE THE END OF THE TERM, OR IF WE TERMINATE SERVICES FOR CAUSE BEFORE THE END OF THE TERM, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR TERM SERVICE PLAN.
No early termination fee is charged if you terminate a Term Service Plan in accordance with the return policy associated with your Term Service Plan.
After the expiration of the term, the Terms relating to Non-Term Service Plans apply.

Use of Services and Equipment; Availability.
==========
You must be at least 18 years old to subscribe to our Services.
We may require you to provide proof of your age and identity.

Services and equipment may not be used for any unlawful, fraudulent or abusive purpose.
By requesting Services, you agree that you will not use Services and equipment in any unlawful, fraudulent or abusive manner.
You may not resell or lease Services or equipment to anyone.
==========
Coverage.
Most services are only available within the operating range of the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network(also see Roaming).
Coverage is not available everywhere.
Coverage and quality of Services may be affected by conditions within or beyond 
our control, including network problems, signal strength, your equipment, and atmospheric, geographic, or topographic conditions.
We do not guarantee service availability or that there will be no interruptions or delays in Services (e.g., dropped calls, blocked calls, etc.).
==========
Number.
We may change the phone number (“Number”) assigned to your PCS device without compensation by giving you prior notice.
You do not own the Number.
You may not modify the Number we program into any phone or other equipment, duplicate the Number to any device other than that authorized by us or, except as allowed for by law, transfer (port) the Number to any other individual or entity.
If you transfer the Number to another carrier, the terms of the Agreement (including the rights and obligations set forth in the Termination paragraphs) still apply.
==========
In certain instances, you may transfer a Number from another carrier to Sprint.
Sprint does not in any way guarantee that such transfers to (or from) Sprint will be successful.
If a transfer to Sprint is not successful, you will be responsible any discounts provided to you with the purchase of your PCS device.
See our printed in-store materials or visit www.SprintPCS.com for additional important information on Number transfers.
==========
Phone Activation Fee.
You may be required to pay a non-refundable phone activation fee when you activate a new Number, have us switch a Number to a different phone, have your current Number changed, we activate a different phone on your existing account or your Service Plan says so.
==========
Charges.
For most forms of wireless Service, your usage will be charged from the time you first initiate contact between your phone or other wireless device and the network until the network connection is broken, whether or not you are successful in connecting with the service with which you seek to connect, even if the connection is later broken or dropped.
An exception is that you are not charged for voice calls that are not completed.
You are charged for completed calls to your Number from the time shortly before the phone starts ringing until the call is terminated.
You will be charged peak rates for the entire duration of calls initiated during the peak time periods applicable to your Service.
You will be charged off-peak rates for the entire duration of calls initiated during the off-peak time periods applicable to your Service.
In addition to these usage charges, you may be charged for recurring monthly service charges, applicable local and long-distance toll charges, other usage charges, (including voicemail access, call waiting, call forwarding, etc.), connection fees, roaming charges, directory assistance, call completion charges, account review and management charges, optional features you select at an extra cost, 
surcharges related to government programs, and taxes.
Charges for most Services are incurred in one-minute increments, with partial minutes of use rounded up to the next highest minute.
You must pay, by each invoice due date, all charges for Services provided to the Number for each phone or other equipment that our records show you activated, no matter who actually uses or has possession of the phone or other equipment at the time Services are provided.
==========
PCS Vision (Third Generation) Wireless Charges.
For PCS Vision wireless services, you will be charged on a per kilobyte basis for data used, rather than for airtime used.
As long as your PCS Vision device is connected to the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network ("PCS Vision network"), you will be incurring data usage charges.
==========
You are responsible for all data activity from and directed to your PCS Phone, regardless of who initiates the activity.
We will invoice you for all data directed to the internet address (or “IP address”) assigned to your device in a given PCS Vision session, regardless of whether your device actually receives the data.
==========
You will be charged for data usage initiated by others as well as those you initiate.
You will be charged for additional data used in transporting and routing on the network.
==========
You will be charged for partial and interrupted data downloads or other use, including re-sent data, and for unsuccessful attempts to reach websites and use other applications and services, including those resulting from dropped network connections.
If you use a Premium Service (including services provided by third parties but for which you are billed on your PCS Invoice), you will be charged for data used in transport and routing in addition to the charge for the Premium Service.
The amount of data used and charged to you will vary widely, depending upon the specific PCS Vision wireless application or other service you use, the amount of data used in the specific application or service, and network congestion and other matters.
For this and other reasons, estimates of data usage – for example, the size of downloadable files – will vary from what you actually use.
You cannot receive incoming calls while using third generation services.
==========
Data usage will be rounded up to the next whole kilobyte.
Kilobyte usage will be rounded up to the next full cent.
==========
Rounding up will occur at the end of each separate session or each clock hour (at the top of each hour), if the session spans more than 1 clock hour.
When traveling on our PCS Vision network, a session may be ended and new session initiated, although no interruption to the actual data session will occur.
==========
Your invoice will not separately identify the number of kilobytes attributable to your use of specific sites, sessions or services used.
PCS Vision Premium Services.
Your PCS Vision wireless services may allow you to access or download premium content for an additional charge.
==========
Certain PCS Vision services (e.g., games, ringers and screen savers) primarily contain premium services content.
Access to and downloading of premium content is not included with PCS Vision services.
The additional charges for this premium content will be billed to you on your PCS Invoice.
You will be charged for this content (at rates and charges specified at the time of access or download) that will be in addition to data usage charges you will incur while connected to the enhanced PCS Vision network.
We provide no warranties and make no representations or claims with regard to third-party Premium Services.
In certain instances, subject to the terms of the content purchased, we may delete premium and non-premium items downloaded to available storage areas (e.g., your vault), including any pictures, games and other content.
==========
We may limit the amount of Premium Services you may purchase in a specific timeframe (month, week, day, or other time period).
We may suspend your use of Premium Services without prior consent or notice if we have reason to suspect fraudulent or unauthorized use of your Premium Services account, but we make no assurances that we will suspend your account.
==========
Other Terms Applicable to PCS Vision Usage.
Use of PCS Vision wireless services requires the purchase of a separate third generation wireless compatible phone or other device and is subject to any software, memory, storage or other limitation in the phone or other equipment.
Not all applications and services work, or work the same, on all third generation wireless phones and devices.
Check the materials accompanying your phone or device to determine which applications and services it will support.
==========
PCS Vision wireless services are not available while off the PCS Vision network.
PCS Vision services are not available for server devices or host computer applications, other systems that drive continuous heavy traffic or data sessions, or as substitutes for private lines or frame relay connections.
Unlimited PCS Vision plans/options are only available with phones or PCS smart phones where the device is not being used as a modem in connection with other equipment (e.g., computers, PDAs, etc.) through use of connection kits or other phone-to-computer/PDA accessories, or Bluetooth or other wireless technology.
==========
Sprint reserves the right to deny or to terminate service without notice for any misuse.
Sprint is not responsible for any opinions, advice, statements, services applications or other information provided by third parties and accessible through PCS Vision wireless services.
Neither Sprint nor its vendors or licensors guarantees the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of information that is obtained through the PCS Vision wireless services.
You are responsible for evaluating such content.
==========
Use of certain PCS Vision wireless services, including some messaging services, may result in the disclosure to others of your email address and other information about you in connection with your internet usage.
Your accessing of, or use of, third party sites or services accessible PCS Vision wireless services may require the disclosure of information about you, subject to the policies of those sites and services.
You consent to receiving advertising, warnings, alerts and other messages, including broadcast messages.
Your access to PCS Vision wireless services is controlled by a password.
==========
Voice Command.
PCS Voice Command is an optional service that allows you to place calls by using speech recognition technology.
Calls to 911 or similar emergency numbers cannot be placed through the Voice Command feature.
==========
Airtime and applicable long distance charges for a call completed from your Number using the Voice Command feature begin when you press or activate the TALK or similar key(s) and end when your call is terminated by hitting the END key or by returning to the Voice Command platform.
If you initiate and complete another call without leaving the Voice Command platform, a separate charge for that call will begin from the time the previous call was terminated.
Airtime and applicable long distance charges will be applied to the entire length of a completed call initiated from Voice Command.
Using Directory Assistance to input names into your Voice Command address book will incur additional charges.
==========
Invoicing.
Invoicing cycles are approximately 30 days in length.
==========
Invoicing cycles and dates may change from time to time.
Except as otherwise provided in your Service Plan, monthly recurring charges (MRCs) are invoiced one invoicing cycle in advance.
==========
Charges for Services are usually invoiced as soon as possible after the charges accrue.
We may, however, invoice you for usage and charges occurring before the invoicing cycle being invoiced, if they were not previously invoiced.
If you are invoiced for usage incurred during a prior invoicing cycle, those minutes will be applied to your Service Plan minutes for the current invoicing cycle.
However, if you change your PCS Service Plan between the time the usage was incurred and the beginning of the current invoicing cycle, those minutes from the prior invoicing cycle will be charged at the rate per minute for usage over included minutes provided in the Service Plan in effect at the time the usage was incurred.
==========
Payment.
If you have authorized payment for Services or equipment by credit card or by debiting a bank account, no additional notice or consent is required before we invoice the credit card or debit the bank account for all amounts due to us or billed by us on behalf of a third party.
You must promptly notify us of any change in your invoicing address or of the credit card or bank account used for payment.
We reserve the right to require payment by money order, cashier's check or other secured form of payment.
If we take action to receive payment beyond invoicing you for charges for Services or equipment, you must pay our costs and expenses of collection, including attorneys' fees and expenses, the fees of any collection agency and court costs.
==========
If we act as an invoicing agent for a third-party service provider, payments received are first applied to amounts due and owing to us and any remaining amounts are applied to sums due and owing to the third-party service provider.
We may immediately charge an additional fee for any check or other negotiable instrument endorsed by you and returned unpaid by a financial institution for any reason.
You may be charged fees for certain methods of payment.
Late Payment Charges.
Payment is past due if we do not receive it by the due date shown on your invoice.
Any payment for Services and equipment not made when due accrues late charges until paid at the rate of 5% per month or at the highest rate allowed by law.
Acceptance of late or partial payments (even if marked "paid in full") does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe us.
If your Service has been suspended due to non-payment, you may be charged a reactivation fee.
==========
Disputed Charges.
You must raise any dispute that you have about any charges invoiced to you within 15 days of the date of the invoice or you have accepted the invoice.
==========

Calls to our sales or general business offices are not notice of a dispute.
If disputed invoice procedures are described on the invoice, you must follow them.
==========

If we agree to provide Services to you on an Account Spending Limit basis, we will tell you your Account Spending Limit before we start Services to your Number, or as reasonably practicable after the limit is imposed.
If we require a deposit for you to establish or keep Services on an Account Spending Limit basis, we will hold the deposit as partial guarantee of payment for Services (see Deposits).
Charges for Services accrue against your Account Spending Limit as they are incurred.
==========
We may charge an initial ASL start up fee.
We may charge a monthly ASL service fee, in addition to your recurring monthly service charge.
==========
We may suspend Services to your Number without prior notice to you when your account balance reaches your Account Spending Limit.
Services are restored when you have paid any past due balance and pay a specified minimum amount to reduce your account balance below your Account Spending Limit.

Even if your bill is not past due, we may suspend services if your unpaid usage exceeds $125 or another amount to be determined by your past credit or usage history.

==========
The rate of interest, if any, on the deposit is subject to change.
We may mix deposits with our other funds.
==========
If Services are terminated for any reason, we may, without notice to you, apply your deposit toward payment of outstanding charges and return any excess to you at your last known address within 75 days after termination of Services.
If the U.S. Postal Service cannot deliver the money to you and returns it to us, we will hold it for you for one year from the date of return and, during that period, we may charge a servicing fee against the deposit balance.
==========
Any money held during this one-year period will not accrue interest for your benefit.
You forfeit any portion of the money left after the one-year period.
==========
Wireless Web and Voice Portal Services.
Wireless Web Services are part of the Services that can be obtained through Sprint.
Wireless Web Services are not available in all markets or while roaming off the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network.

Use of Wireless Web Services requires an Internet-ready PCS Phone or certain other equipment (or both) and is subject to any memory, storage or other limitation in the phone or other equipment.
Wireless Web Services are not available on PCS Vision phones or devices.
The Caller ID blocking feature is not available when using Wireless Web Services.
Any use of Wireless Web Services deducts from your Service Plan minutes.

You are charged for time spent connected to the Wireless Web or Voice Portal, including time spent browsing on the Internet or Voice Portal and reviewing or scrolling through Internet information on-line while still connected to the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network.
Not all Internet sites can be accessed and you may receive an error message if you attempt to access a site that cannot be accessed through Wireless Web Services.

You are responsible for evaluating such content.
==========
Taxes and Surcharges.
We invoice you for taxes, fees and other charges levied by or remitted directly to federal, state or local authorities, or foreign government on Services including, without limitation, sales, gross receipts, use, and excise taxes.
==========
If you claim any tax exemption, you must provide us with a valid tax-exempt document.
Any tax exemption applies only from the date we receive a valid tax-exempt document.
==========
We also invoice you for fees that we collect and remit to the government such as Universal Service, and for surcharges that we collect and keep to pay for the costs of complying with government mandates such as number pooling and portability, and Enhanced 911 service.
These charges are neither taxes nor government imposed assessments.
==========
Roaming.
Calls made while off the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network are "roaming" calls.
Your PCS Phone is specifically designed and engineered to work only on the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network.
It works on another CDMA PCS provider's system only when a roaming agreement is in place between Sprint and the other providers.
If your PCS Phone is a dual-mode phone, it works on both a CDMA PCS provider's system (in addition to the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network) and a wireless analog telecommunications provider's system only when roaming agreements are in place between Sprint and the other providers.
If we do not have a roaming agreement in place, you may be able to place roaming calls "manually" by using a valid credit card.
If there is a gap or other interruption of coverage within a PCS coverage area that prevents connection with the Sprint Nationwide PCS Network and your dual-band phone is set to roam automatically when outside PCS coverage, you may incur roaming fees within a PCS coverage area.
Certain features and services may not be available when roaming (including PCS Vision, voicemail, call waiting, call forwarding, etc.).
==========
Phones and Other Equipment.
Phones and other equipment may be purchased and returned as provided in the purchase documents.
We are not the manufacturer of the phones or other equipment.
The only warranties on the phones or other equipment are any limited warranties extended by the manufacturers.
We have no liability in connection with the phones and other equipment or for the manufacturers' acts or omissions.
Lost or Stolen Equipment.
If your phone or other equipment is lost or stolen, you must notify us by calling PCS Customer Service Solutions.
You are responsible for all charges for Services provided to the Number for the lost or stolen equipment before you notify us of the loss or theft.
We will deactivate Services to the Number upon notification to us of any loss or theft.
You may be required to provide evidence of the loss or theft (for example, a police report or sworn statement).
If the equipment is later found, we may require that you exchange it for another phone or other equipment before we reactivate Services (if we do reactivate Services), as well as require you to pay a reactivation fee.
==========
We will deactivate Services to any Number without prior notice to you if we suspect any unlawful or fraudulent use of the Number.
You agree to cooperate reasonably with us in investigating suspected unlawful or fraudulent use.
==========
Messages.
You will incur airtime usage charges when accessing your voicemail from your PCS Phone.
You may also incur charges in accessing text messages from your PCS Phone.
You may access your voicemail without incurring airtime usage charges by checking your voicemail from a wireline phone.
We may impose limits on the number of voicemail or text message that can be retained through your PCS account.
Audible or visual indicators of text or voicemail messages, including mailbox icons on your PCS Phone, may not always provide an up to date indication of new messages.
In certain instances, you may be required to manually reset or clear your mailbox indicator.
==========
Caller ID.
If you do not want people you call to receive the Number assigned to your phone, you must call PCS Customer Service Solutions for information about automatic Caller ID blocking.
The Number assigned to your phone can be blocked on a per-call basis by dialing *67 + Destination Number + TALK (or similar key), but Caller ID delivery resumes on the next call you make.
Caller ID display on incoming calls to your Number depends on receiving the information from the calling party.
==========
TTY Access.
A TTY (also known as TDD or Text Telephone) is a telecommunications device that allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who have speech or language disabilities, to communicate by telephone.
TTY doesn't work with all PCS Phones.
==========
If you have a PCS TTY-capable phone, it may not function effectively, or at all, when attempting 911 calls due to the equipment or software of the answering agency.
Therefore, a TTY device should not be relied on for 911 calls.
==========
Pay-Per-Call Service.
We will not complete calls from your Number to 900, 976 and similar numbers for pay-per-call services.
==========
International Calling.
You may be limited in the international destinations that you can call with Services.
You should contact PCS Customer Service Solutions for information about international destinations that you cannot call.
==========
Limitation of Liability.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, our sole liability to you for any loss or damage arising out of providing or failing to provide Services (including mistakes, omissions, interruptions, delays, errors, or defects) does not exceed (1) in cases related to a specific piece of equipment, the prorated MRC for Services to the piece of equipment during the affected period, or (2) in cases not related to a specific piece of equipment, the prorated MRCs for Services to you during the affected period.
Neither we nor our vendors, suppliers or licensors are liable for any damage arising out of or in connection with:
a) any act or omission of any telecommunications service or other service provider other than us;
b) any directory listing;
c) any dropped calls or inability to place or receive calls;

h) any interruption or failure of 911 or E911 emergency services or identification of the Number, address or name associated with any person accessing or attempting to access emergency services from your phone;
i) the installation or repair of any products or equipment by parties who are not our authorized employees or agents;
j) events due to factors beyond our control, including acts of God (including, without limitation, weather-related phenomena, fire or earthquake), war, riot, strike, or orders of governmental authority;
k) any act or omission of any third party or independent contractor that offers products or services in conjunction with or through the Services; or
l) your negligent or intentional act or omission.
==========
NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES, PHONES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
==========
THIS SECTION SURVIVES TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Indemnification.
You indemnify and defend us, our partners, directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any claim, action, damage, liability and expense arising out of or in connection with: (1) your acts or omissions that occur in connection with your use of the Services or equipment used in connection with the Services, and (2) any communications you make or receive using the Services.
This indemnification extends to and includes any attorney's fees and costs incurred by us arising from any actions or claims to which this indemnification applies, or from the contesting of the applicability of this provision.
This section survives termination of this Agreement.

MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES.
ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE OF ANY KIND BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND THE COMPANY AND/OR ANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, OR TORT, INCLUDING FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY AND REGARDLESS OF THE DATE OF ACCRUAL OF SUCH CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION AS PRESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.
==========
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, NOT STATE LAW, GOVERNS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A CLAIM IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION.
HOWEVER, NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL PRECLUDE THE CUSTOMER FROM RESOLVING ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT HE OR SHE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE.
==========
A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law will conduct the arbitration.
The arbitrator will be selected according to the rules of CPR or, alternatively, may be selected by agreement of the parties, who shall cooperate in good faith to select the arbitrator.
The arbitration will be conducted by, and under the then-applicable rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution.
==========
All expedited procedures prescribed by the applicable rules will apply.
Any required hearing fees and costs shall be paid by the parties as required by the applicable rules or as required by applicable law, but the arbitrator shall have the power to apportion such costs as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
==========
The arbitrator's decision and award will be final and binding (subject to the appeal clause below), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
An appeal may be taken under the CPR Arbitration Appeal Procedure from any final award of any arbitral panel in any arbitration arising out of or related to this agreement that is conducted in accordance with the requirements of such Appeal Procedure.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the appeal tribunal, the appeal shall be conducted at the place of the original arbitration.
If any party files a judicial or administrative action asserting a claim that is subject to arbitration and another party successfully stays such action or compels arbitration, the party filing that action must pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including attorney's fees.
