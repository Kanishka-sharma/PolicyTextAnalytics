How We Share and Use Information About You Within the Schwab Family of Companies
The term “Schwab” refers to a family of financial services companies that are owned by The Charles Schwab Corporation.
These companies are often referred to as “affiliates” and include, but are not limited to:
Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a broker-dealer
Charles Schwab Bank, a retail bank
Charles Schwab Trust Company, a division of Charles Schwab Bank
Charles Schwab, Hong Kong, Limited
Charles Schwab, U.K., Limited
Schwab Retirement Plan Services, Inc.
The 401(k) Companies, Inc.
==========
Many clients do business with more than one Schwab affiliate, creating an efficient, comprehensive financial relationship to meet individual needs.
When appropriate, Schwab may share information we collect about you within our family of companies to:
help provide you with better service or perform services on our behalf;
respond to communications from you (or as you authorize or request);
make it more convenient for you to open a new account.
Schwab may also allow an affiliate to provide you with information about its products and services that we believe may benefit or interest you.
You may instruct Schwab not to share information about you with our affiliates for certain purposes, as explained under “How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Information About You.”
How We Share Information About You Outside of the Schwab Family of Companies
We provide access to information about you to outside companies and other third parties in certain limited circumstances, including:
to help us process transactions for your account;
when we use another company to provide services for us, such as printing and mailing your account statements;
when we believe that disclosure is required or permitted under law.
For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, to perform credit/authentication checks, or for risk control.
==========
Schwab may also enter into a joint-marketing agreement with another financial institution in order to provide you with a Schwab-branded financial product or service.
We only make such agreements with companies that we believe can help us provide a financial product or service that will benefit you.
==========
You may instruct us not to share information about you with outside companies for this purpose, as explained under “How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Information About You.”
How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Information About You
If you prefer, you may choose to limit the information we share about you among our affiliates and outside companies for marketing purposes.
If you choose to do so, Schwab will not:
share with our affiliates consumer reports and other personal information about you that may be used to determine your eligibility for credit (for example, information about your income, profession or employment status);
allow our affiliates to market their financial products or services to you based on eligibility information they receive from us;
share personal information about you with an outside company for joint-marketing purposes.

Your choice will be applied to you as an individual and will automatically be extended to all of your accounts at Schwab.
==========
Joint account holders may instruct us on behalf of another account holder but only in relation to the joint account.
You may make your privacy choice at any time, and it will remain in effect until you tell Schwab to change it.
If you have previously given Schwab your privacy choice with respect to your current accounts, you do not need to provide it again.
If you exercise your privacy choice, Schwab will continue to share information among our affiliates that identifies you (such as your name and Social Security number), as well as information about your transactions and experiences with us.
In addition, Schwab affiliates may continue to use information about you to perform services on our behalf, to respond to communications from you, as you authorize or request, or, if you are their customer, to offer you products or services.
==========
We may also continue to share information about you with outside companies as permitted or required by law.
Company Mailing Choice
Unless we receive your objection, Schwab may be required under the provisions of Rule 14b-1 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to release your name, address and number of shares to the issuers of securities you hold.
If you object, you will not receive any corporate communications mailed out by the issuer other than regulatory mailings required to be sent out to all holders, which you will receive from us.
==========

State Laws
Schwab will comply with state laws that apply to the disclosure or use of information about you.
