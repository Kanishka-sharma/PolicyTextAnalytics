					Introduction and Overview
				


				This Privacy Policy (
				
					"Policy"
				
				) explains how your personal information is collected, used, shared and
				processed when accessing this website or using other services provided
				by its operator, including any written, electronic, and oral communications,
				online or offline, and purchases performed (collectively, the
				
					"Services"
				
				) as well as the rights and choices you have associated with that information.
The Services include any services provided via this website, located at
				us.SHEIN.com (the
				
					"Site"
				
				), our mobile applications (the
				
					"Apps"
				
				), our accounts and fan pages on social media platforms (the
				
					"Social Media Accounts"
				
				), and any other websites, pages, features, or content owned and operated
				by the Company that hyperlink to this Policy.
The company selling the products via the Site and Apps and providing the
				Services (and therefore, the payment collection entity) is SHEIN Distribution
				Corporation, 757 S. Alameda St., Suite 220, Los Angeles, CA 90021, acting
				as a joint controller of the information together with Roadget Business
				Pte. Ltd., 7 Temasek Boulevard, #12 07 Suntec Tower One, Singapore (038987).
==========
Therefore, the terms "Company", "we", "us" or "our" refer to different
				entities.
Please read our
					
						Terms and Conditions
					
					and this Policy before accessing or using our Services.
If you cannot
					agree with this Policy or the Terms and Conditions, please do not access
					or use our Services.
By using our Services, you accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy
				Policy on the site you are using.
==========
The Company is operating the Services and the sale of SHEIN brand products,
				and therefore, is the controller of your personal data, and is also responsible
				for processing and protecting your personal data.
The joint controllers stated above have entered into a joint controller
				agreement, allocating the essential responsibilities as follows: Roadget
				Business Pte. Ltd. will be responsible for operating the Site and providing
				for its security.
Shein Distribution Corporation will be responsible for
				using the Site in its respective territory to sell products to customers,
				collecting payment and processing returns.
The joint controllership agreement
				is necessary because of the aforementioned separation of the technical
				and commercial levels, while at the same time processing your data is necessary
				for both companies, respectively, to provide you with the overall Services
				(consisting of both the sales and the Site and Apps).
==========
Right to modify this Policy: We may change this Policy from time to time,
					to reflect how we are processing your data, and if we make changes, we
					will notify you by revising the effective date or last modified data at
					the top of this Policy.
If we make significant changes that materially
					affect your privacy rights, we will provide advanced notice and make that
					clear on the SHEIN website or other SHEIN services, or by some other means
					of contact such as email, so that you are able to review the changes before
					you continue to use the Services.
==========
Your continued access or use of our Services
					after receiving the notice of changes, constitutes your acknowledgement
					that you accept the updated Policy.
Instant information:
				
				In addition, we may provide you with real time disclosures or additional
				information about the personal information handling practices of specific
				parts of our Services.
Such notices may supplement this Policy or provide
				you with additional choices about how we process your personal information.
