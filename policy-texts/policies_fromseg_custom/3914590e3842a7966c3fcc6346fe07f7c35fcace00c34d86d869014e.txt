ABOUT CAFEMOM  
CafeMom is an online service for moms that allows our mom members to set up unique personal profiles and, through those profiles, to create an online network of other moms.
CafeMom members ("Members") can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and make new friends on the Site, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests.
To enrich our Members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other Members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends.
CafeMom members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other Members and CafeMom communicates with them.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
When you Register.
When you register with CafeMom, you create your own profile and privacy settings.
Your profile information, as well as your screen name and photo are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to allow you to connect with other CafeMom Members.
==========
Your real name is never displayed on the Site (unless you use it as your screen name), but your real name will be included in emails that you "send to a friend."
You can choose to allow Members to search for you by using your real name or most other information you have entered in your profile.
Please be aware that certain personal profile information is displayed for all Members and cannot be hidden.
Specifically, your screen name, photo, number of kids and the location entered on your profile are always displayed on the Site and therefore, are viewable by all users.
In addition, because this information is publicly displayed on the Site, it may appear in the results of searches conducted on Internet search engines while you are a Member of the Site and potentially for some time period after your membership is terminated, depending upon the search engine's indexing practices.
==========
By using the search functionality on the Site, CafeMom Members can find other moms with similar interests and challenges.
When you find other Members, you can view their personal profiles to find out more about them based on the information they have decided to share on the Site.
Journals and Photos.
As a CafeMom Member, you can share personal content, such as journals and photos.
Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally identifiable information may be accessible to Members and non-Members, and CafeMom has no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.
We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the public and private forums and interactive areas on our Site.
Please review our Terms of Service for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.
==========
We'll send you our email and newsletters.
CafeMom may send you service-related announcements and emails from time to time.
For instance, if a friend sends you a message or someone comments on your photos or journal, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact.
We may also use your information to send you e-newsletters, updates and communications about CafeMom.
We may ask you which newsletters you wish to receive.
You may change your newsletter preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account, which you can do by clicking on the "Edit Profile" button posted throughout the Site, or (ii) by opting-out of receiving future emails as described at the bottom of each communication from CafeMom.
==========
Sweepstakes and Promotions.
On occasion, we offer sweepstakes and other promotions in conjunction with a sponsor.
By participating in a promotion, you submit to that promotion's terms and conditions including providing us with permission, if required, to share your personally identifiable information with a particular sponsor.
==========
Third Party Offers.
On occasion, we are able to offer you special products or services through a relationship with a third party.
In those cases, the offer will be brought to you by CafeMom and fulfilled by the third party.
If you accept the offer, you will become a customer of the company that is fulfilling the offer and we will not have control over their use of the personally identifiable information that you provide to them when you accept the offer.
==========
Invite a Friend.
If you do become a Member, not only can you enjoy all of the benefits of membership, but you can also invite other individuals to join by providing us with their first names and email addresses.
Using the information you give us on these potential Members, we will send them an email invitation to join CafeMom.
The only way these individuals can become Members, however, is if they come to our Site and sign up themselves.
We do not use this information for other purposes.
==========
Legal Matters; Safety.
We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
Additionally, we may disclose your information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.
==========
Sale of Business or Assets.
In the event that CafeMom, substantially all of its assets, or a line of business are acquired or merged with another company, personally identifiable information of our Members may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction.
