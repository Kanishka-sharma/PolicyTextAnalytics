Forbes.com users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.
Gathering of Information
Voluntary Submission
Forbes.com does not collect personally identifying information about any individual Forbes.com website user except when knowingly provided by such individual.
For example, we may ask you for information, such as your e-mail address, zip code and the country in which you are viewing the website when you register to become a member of Forbes.com.
You may also provide information to Forbes.com in other contexts, including, for example, in order to register for Attach√© or to enter into a sweepstakes or promotion.
In the event you order something from Forbes.com or one of our sponsors, we may request additional personal information, such as your address, telephone number and credit card information, in order to complete the purchase.
==========
You always have the option not to provide the information we request.
If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Forbes.com website, but you may be unable to access certain options and services.
When you register or become a member of Forbes.com or provide information to Forbes.com in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information.
==========
Cookies
A cookie is a data file that certain websites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit such sites.
A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited.
Forbes.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns throughout the Forbes.com website and to remember your custom video playlists, job title, story ratings (if you have provided any), and membership status so that you don't have to login each time you visit the website.
We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user.
Business partners of Forbes.com and vendors providing hosting and other services for Forbes.com., as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements on our website may set their own unique cookies on your browser.
==========
We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain.
If you would like more information about this practice and about your option not to accept cookies placed by these companies, please click here.
Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies.
However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our website, you may not be able to use certain features of the site.

Log Files/Browser Level Information
Forbes.com Web servers automatically collect information about a site user's IP address, browser type and the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the website or not) and which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the website or not) by reading this information from the user's browser (information provided by every user's browser).
This information is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our website.
This information is automatically logged by most websites.
Forbes.com also uses a third party to collect information, including through the use of web beacons.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We employ and our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs).
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We and our third party advertising partners may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
In some instances clear gifs may also drop a cookie to enable us to retarget select users with relevant advertising by linking it with behavioral data aggregated by our 3rd party advertising partners.
==========
Log Files
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We and our third party advertising partners may link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
IP addresses may be tied to personally identifiable information to enable us to retarget select users with relevant advertising.
Use of Information
Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our website.
To Target Content
To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our website users prefer based upon traffic to those areas.
We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.
==========
To Provide Interactive Communications From Forbes.com
To enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications, such as our electronic newsletters, to the e-mail address that you provide to us.
Such interactive communications are provided only to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive them as part of their user profile.
From time to time we may provide e-mails highlighting new features, promotions or contests on the website to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile.
==========
To Provide Communications From Third Parties
We respect the privacy of our users and shall not disclose or distribute our user list to any third party, nor shall it permit anyone else to do so.
However, we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive third party information and offers as part of their user profile.
In those cases, your personal information is not transferred to the third party.
Control of Your Information
Users may change their user profile to stop receiving newsletters or marketing material from Forbes.com or on behalf of external third party business partners.
Users may choose to stop receiving such communications at any time by visiting the "edit my profile" page at http://www.forbes.com/membership/editprofile.jhtml, or by following instructions at the end of any e-mail.
==========
Sharing of Information
When you are on an area of Forbes.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Forbes.com as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Forbes.com.
If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service.
In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided directly to advertisers.
Aggregate, Anonymous Information With Advertisers
Forbes.com derives the majority of its revenue from advertising and sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users.
In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience.
We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.
==========
As Necessary to Provide Services to You
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of newsletter mailings, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services.
We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service.
In some instances, one of these companies may collect information directly from you (such as for credit card processing for purchase of archived articles).
==========
In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the external service provider.
In all cases, these companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
In The Event of Sale or Bankruptcy
The ownership of Forbes.com may change at some point in the future.
Should that occur, we want this site to be able to maintain a relationship with you.
In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change in control of Forbes.com LLC and/or Forbes.com your information may be shared with the person or business that owns or controls this site.
==========
Opting out of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be respected regarding the use of your information.
As Required By Law
Forbes.com may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Forbes.com or to protect and defend the rights or property of Forbes.com.
Security
Your information is stored on Forbes.com's servers located in the United States.
==========
We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers.
We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access.
We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.
However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
==========
Privacy of Children
Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us--including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.
How to Contact Us
If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to contact us by e-mail at privacy@forbes.net.
==========
We read every message submitted and try to reply promptly to every one.
How Will I Know if the Privacy Policy Is Changed?
This statement may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail.
