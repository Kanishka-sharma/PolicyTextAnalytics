DeepIntent: Ad Platform and Website Privacy Policies
The details of DeepIntent’s privacy statement are below.
If you have questions about our mobile and website security or our privacy policy online, please email contact@deepintent.com
This privacy policy applies to our corporate websites, or “Websites”, as well as to our advertising product and advertising landing pages (collectively “Product”).
PLATFORM PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy explains how DeepIntent, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our”) and our affiliates and subsidiaries collect, use, and share information transmitted from desktop or mobile devices (“Connected Devices”) via our desktop and mobile advertising services and advertising landing pages (“Services”).
OVERVIEW OF SERVICES
DeepIntent is a marketing and advertising technology platform specializing in audience insights and media buying.
Our Services combine data, technology, and strategy to help advertisers reach the audiences most likely to be interested in their products or services.
==========
If you visit the website, a site that belongs to a platform member, or use a mobile application of one of our platform members, that property will have its own privacy policy and practices.
You will need to refer to the member’s privacy policy for information about their data collection and use practices.
DeepIntent adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) and the European Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“EDAA”) self-regulatory principles.
==========
DATA COLLECTION & USAGE
We may collect non-personally identifiable information from Connected Devices using cookies, scripts, web beacons, or other similar techniques.
These technologies are used to collect digital actions of users that visit and use websites and applications, or interact with ads presented in websites and applications of our platform members.
We also receive other data (e.g., demographic information) from third parties that we combine with the data we collect through the Services.
The data we collect can include a device identifier, browser and operating system type and version, device type, and other data from or about a Connected Device, as well as information about users’ site visits and application use.
We may also receive data related to the location of a Connected Device from platform members and other parties.
==========
We may use data for purposes including analytics, research, reporting, Service enhancements and other business operations, frequency capping, and in multiple ways to make ads more relevant.
For instance, we may use the location related data to present ads from a local business or use that and other data we collect to deliver ads that the user may find more relevant to their interests.
Another example would be using this data to create “segments” – groups of users that are inferred to share similar interests.
==========
We may also sometimes collect information on behalf of our clients when asked to do so.
Such information may contain personally identifiable information (including name or phone number) or non-personally identifiable information that we collect and then provide to the client.
This data is retained subject to their privacy policy, and is used by us for reporting purposes.
In such cases, we will provide you with a link to the third party’s privacy policy and a mechanism to opt out of the collection of that data at the time of collection.
