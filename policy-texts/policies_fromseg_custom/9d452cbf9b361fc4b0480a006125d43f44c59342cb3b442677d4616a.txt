YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.
Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
Atom Entertainment qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.
Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail).

Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.
==========
1)	Single Opt-in Method:  In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.
The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Atom Entertainment will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Atom Entertainment to send text messages to him or her.
Atom Entertainment will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message.
The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Atom Entertainment or by sending a text message to Atom Entertainment that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".

The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service Agreement before the online registration process is completed.
Atom Entertainment will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Atom Entertainment to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).
The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Atom Entertainment's wireless marketing service.
Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.

==========
b.  Termination of Wireless Sites by User.
