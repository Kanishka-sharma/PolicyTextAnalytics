==========
How Does CaringBridge Use Journal Entries, Guestbook Entries and Photographs?
CaringBridge sites, by their very nature, contain a great deal of personal information about the author of the CaringBridge site, visitors to the CaringBridge site, and other individuals.
CaringBridge sites, including journal entries, guestbook entries, and photographs, may be viewed by anyone who has access to the CaringBridge site.
For this reason, we offer password protection and let the author of the CaringBridge site control the level of privacy that will apply to his or her CaringBridge site.
In general, CaringBridge does not use the personal information contained in journal entries, guestbook entries, or photographs, except to provide this online service to you, your friends and your family.
We do not have the resources to monitor every CaringBridge site and do not have the obligation to do so.
We do, however, reserve the right to review the content of any CaringBridge site, for example, if we receive a complaint about misuse of this Site or as part of a random spot check.
==========
We reserve the right to delete any journal entry, guestbook entry or photograph and to take legal action against anyone who violates our Terms of Service.
We reserve the right to disclose the content of any CaringBridge site in response to a subpoena or as required by applicable law.
Finally we reserve the right to disclose journal and guestbook entries, photographs, and other information posted on this Site with law enforcement authorities if, in our sole judgment, the content of any posting violates any applicable law.
==========
What Security steps does CaringBridge take to protect your personal information?
CaringBridge takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information.
The following is a summary of the measures that CaringBridge takes to protect your information.
Firewall protection
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption (for author profile, site creation and donation processing)
Restricted data center access
Restricted database access
Secure server dedicated to online donations to ensure financial and personal information is strictly guarded
Although we use security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, misuse or alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control.
Does CaringBridge Share Personal Information With Others?
==========
Third-Party Vendors.
CaringBridge shares personal information collected through this Site with third party vendors who act for or on behalf of CaringBridge.
For example, when you make an online donation to CaringBridge, a third party processes your donation on our behalf.
These third party vendors may need information about you in order to perform their functions.
These companies are not authorized to use your personal information for any other purpose.
==========
Sponsors.
CaringBridge sponsors include organizations, such as hospitals and other treatment facilities, who have paid a fee to provide this service.
If you have been served by one of our sponsors, you may identify that organization as your sponsor when you create a CaringBridge site.
If you identify a sponsor when you create a CaringBridge site, we may share the date you created the CaringBridge site, and information about activity levels on your CaringBridge site with that sponsor.
If you do not wish us to share this information with a sponsor, simply do not identify a sponsor when you create your CaringBridge site.
==========
Other Circumstances.
There may be some other, limited circumstances in which we may share or transfer the information in our databases or the content of a CaringBridge site to an unrelated third party, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, to enforce our Terms of Service, in response to a subpoena, to protect the security of this Site and the integrity of our databases, if we transfer the ownership or operation of this Site to another organization, if we merge with another organization, or in some similar event.
Where appropriate, before disclosing personal information to a third party, CaringBridge will contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that information against unauthorized use or disclosure.
==========

CaringBridge shares statistical information about the use of our site with our donors, sponsors and partners.
This information does not identify any individual personally.
Technical Information Collected Through CaringBridge.org
When you access this Site, we use standard web server technology to collect technical information, such as the name of your Internet service provider, its IP address, the name of your operating system (such as Windows® or MacIntosh®), your browser type (such as Netscape® or Internet Explorer®), the length of time you spend on our site during a visit, the pages you visit, and so on.
This information does not identify you personally, and we do not attempt to tie this technical information to any of the personal information you provide.
We use this information to improve this Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors.
Privacy Settings
Our goal is to balance our users’ need to find each other and communicate information and support against our users’ desire for a measure of privacy.
==========
We have found that
some of our authors prefer a completely open CaringBridge site that contains no restrictions regarding who may access the site,
some wish to simply have all visitors identify themselves,
some wish their CaringBridge site to be open to most people, but, for any number of reasons, wish to exclude certain specific individuals (“Blocked Visitors”), and
some wish to limit access to their CaringBridge site to family and close friends (“Approved Visitors”).
Because our authors have different preferences and needs, we let each author choose from a menu of privacy settings.
On June 1, 2005, we upgraded this Site.
CaringBridge sites created on or after June 1, 2005 have different privacy settings than the CaringBridge sites created before June 1, 2005.
Privacy settings for CaringBridge sites created on or after June 1, 2005
The author of a CaringBridge site created on or after June 1, 2005 may choose from the following menu of privacy settings:
Open Viewing:
Visitors must know the web address (“URL”) of the CaringBridge site to visit the site.
==========
In addition, if the author chooses to create a Visitor Password, visitors must know the Visitor Password to visit the CaringBridge site.
Visitors will not be required to register before viewing the CaringBridge site.
Visitors will, however, be required to register before they may post guestbook entries or tribute entries to the CaringBridge site.
Registration required:
Visitors must know the web address (“URL”) of the CaringBridge site to visit the site.
In addition, if the author chooses to create a Visitor Password, visitors must know the Visitor Password to visit the CaringBridge site.
Visitors will be required to register before viewing or posting entries to the CaringBridge site.
You may create an “Approved Visitor List” so that only those Visitors who are registered and on the Approved Visitor List may view or post entries to the CaringBridge site.
You may create a “Blocked Visitor List” so that Visitors who are registered and on the Blocked Visitor List will not have access to the CaringBridge site.
Privacy for CaringBridge sites created before June 1, 2005
The author of a CaringBridge site created before June 1, 2005 may choose from the following menu of privacy settings:
Level I. Visitors must know the web address (the (“URL”) of the CaringBridge site to view and post to the CaringBridge site.
Registration is not required.
Level II.
Visitors must know the web address (the (“URL”) of the CaringBridge site and the Visitor Username/Password to view and post to the CaringBridge site.
The author of the CaringBridge site chooses the Visitor Username/Password.
==========
Registration is not required.
The privacy level and settings for a CaringBridge may be changed at any time by the author.
Because of the private nature of a CaringBridge site, CaringBridge does not post a directory of CaringBridge sites.
Protect the Privacy of Your CaringBridge site and the CaringBridge sites You Visit
Every member of a caring community, including the author, family and all visitors, is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the web site address (“URL”), the author’s unique username/password, and any visitor password.
Our system provides a measure of privacy only if the web site address, the author's username/password, and the visitor password are not shared with others without the author’s permission.
CaringBridge has no way of knowing and will not be responsible or liable if the individual accessing a CaringBridge site obtained the web site address or the other settings through improper means.
In addition, individuals using this Site must understand that the Internet is inherently insecure and no web site operator can guarantee that a web site is secure.
CaringBridge does not warrant that this Site or any CaringBridge site is secure or “hackerproof” you use this Site solely at your own risk.
==========
Take Special Care to Protect Children Under the Age of Thirteen
Caring communities may include friends and family of all ages.
Special care must be taken to protect children under the age of 13.
For this reason, CaringBridge does not permit children to create or maintain their own CaringBridge sites—a parent or guardian must register as the author and take responsibility for the CaringBridge site.
We require that our authors and their visitors take similar precautions before giving a child under the age of 13 access to a CaringBridge site.
Neither authors nor visitors may provide the web site address or password for a CaringBridge site to a child under the age of 13 without the express consent of the child’s parent or guardian.
We recommend that parents and guardians instruct their children on the safe use of a CaringBridge site and supervise their children as necessary.
An excellent resource for teaching children to use the Internet safely is available at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html.

CaringBridge.org contains links to web sites that are not operated by CaringBridge.
The authors of CaringBridge sites frequently post links to third party sites on their CaringBridge sites.
These links are provided as a service and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party web sites nor any association with their operators.
