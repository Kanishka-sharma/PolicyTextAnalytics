IP Address Logging
DealTime logs IP addresses (your unique Internet address) for system administration purposes.
IP addresses are logged to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting so that we can update and improve the services we offer to you.
We do not link IP addresses to any information that could personally identify you.
This means that the path of your DealTime session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous.
Cookies
DealTime uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users.
A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our site.
You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., saved searches).

Sharing Information
Unless you give explicit permission (e.g., you opt to receive e-mail from partners and third parties), DealTime has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information (such as your e-mail address or mailing address), except when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights, safety or property of DealTime, our users, or others.
