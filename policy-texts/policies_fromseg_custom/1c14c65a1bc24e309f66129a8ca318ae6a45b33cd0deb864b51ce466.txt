This Privacy Policy only applies to the services of Localsensor.
It does not govern the use, practices or policies of our clients, our partners or any other parties.
About Localsensor
Localsensor B.V. is a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands, having its registered offices in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, at the Hogehilweg 19, 1101 CB.
Localsensor is registered with the Chamber of Commerce under number 55634958.
Localsensor is a mobile advertising technology company.
We help companies to plan, execute, evaluate and optimize location-related mobile advertising campaigns via our platform (the 'Platform').
Our clients are companies of all sorts that wish to provide you with mobile advertisements that are relevant and of interest to you.
Our business partners are publishers that serve you these advertisements on their mobile websites and in their mobile apps.
Localsensor’s Platform Privacy Practices
The advertisements served on your device by Localsensor are selected based on information provided by our business partners with your consent.
The information includes precise geographic location, device information and your use of websites and apps.
Information coming from our business partners is linked to a pseudonymous identifier of the device you are using.
==========
It is then used for anonymous profiling.
After processing the information coming from our business partners with the purpose of improving our profiles, the information is immediately and completely removed from our servers.
Based on the information associated with this pseudonymous identifier over time, Localsensor creates profiles that enable us to further specify what types of advertisements are relevant for the use associated with this pseudonymous identifier.
We use hashing, encryption, pseudonymisation and de-identification techniques to ensure that the information in our profile database can in no way be linked to you as a person.
==========
This allows us to only identify your device for the purposes of providing our service and prevents your information being used to identify you in real life, either by us, our clients or our business partners.
What information does Localsensor collect and process?
On the Platform we only collect and use non-personally identifying information (‘non-PII’) and we prohibit our clients from providing or otherwise using any personally identifying information (‘PII’) on the Platform.
We further require our business partners to only share non-PII if they have your consent.
Non-PII includes information regarding your device (such as pseudonymous identifier, operating system, network provider, device location, device model and mobile browser), information regarding the use of websites, apps and other services and profile information like age and gender.
On our Website (www.localsensor.com) we collect both non-PII and PII (like email-addresses and phone-numbers).
We will only collect PII on our website with your full consent.
For what purposes do we process information?
On our Platform, we use the non-PII we receive from our business partners for limited and well-defined purposes.
==========
First of all, after we receive the information, we use it to directly display mobile advertisements to you based on your interests, preferences and location(s) and our clients advertising objectives.
We then use the information to improve the profile that is connected to the pseudonymous identifier associated with your device.
This helps us to provide you with even more relevant advertisements in the future.
We provide our clients with filtering options to manage the advertisements that are displayed to you and to target specific audiences.
==========
Localsensor also analyzes the aggregated information we have in order to continuously improve our Platform.
We also generate and store anonymous statistical data at an aggregate level.
Localsensor will never add information to profiles to such a degree that identifiers can be linked to you as a person by way of combination of (meta)data.
==========
On our Website (www.localsensor.com) we use the PII provided by you only for purposes of contacting you or to send you newsletters with your full consent.
With whom do we share information?
We share the information we receive from our business partners with our advertising clients, but only at an aggregate, non-individual specific level.
Insofar as this is necessary for ad delivery and associated services, we also share information from our database with our publishing partners.
We share the information we process with trusted technology service providers and other third parties for reporting, accounting, analytics and other legitimate business purposes.
==========
We may disclose non-PII and PII when obligated to do so by law, for instance to law enforcement authorities, our legal advisers or other third parties.
We may also disclose information if this is necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our rights.
This may also include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
We may also share non-PII and PII in connection with a merger, a sale of assets or a financing or acquisition of all or part of our business to another company.
==========
Whenever we share your information for this reason we will ensure that the recipient uses all information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please note that once information is shared with a third party, our Privacy Policy does not cover this third party's processing of the information.
Any third parties to whom we may disclose any information may have their own privacy policies, which describe how they process the information.
Cookies
On the Platform, we do not collect information by use of cookies, beacons or the like.
It is however possible that our business partners use tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information about users who view or interact with these partners.
This Privacy Policy does not cover this conduct by our partners.
Please consult the relevant privacy policies of these partners for more information.
==========
On our Website we use Google Analytics cookies in order to collect data on the usage of the website and visits to the website.
Google Analytics stores a permanent cookie on the device you used to visit our website which is subsequently used to register your use of the website.
Google then analyzes the information and the results are given to Localsensor.
This enables us to get more insight in the way the website is used and, based on this information, to make adjustments to the website or the provided services.
Google can give this information to third parties if it is legally obligated to do so and/or if third parties are processing the information on behalf of Google.
Google can not use the information for other Google services.
==========
How do we protect information?
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect information against loss or any form of unlawful use.
For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to perform their services.
Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
==========
How long do we store information?
We will retain the information we receive from our business partners only for as long as is necessary to improve the profiles linked to pseudonymous identifiers.
Once the information has served its purpose, it is immediately deleted, including al geo-location data.
==========
Pseudonymous identifiers and the associated non-PII metadata are stored until the pseudonymous identifier has not been used via our business partners for more than one year.
Opting-out, viewing, changing and deleting your information
Because we cannot identify you, it is not possible to opt-out of the use on our Platform of the information we receive from our business partners.
We only process information we receive from our business partners.
Please consult the opt-out options that our business partners provide.
If you wish to know what information Localsensor has collected about you on our Website or if you wish to have this information changed or deleted, please contact us via privacy@localsensor.com.
Localsensor will provide you with the information within 4 weeks.
==========
Transfer of information to countries outside the EU
The following applies with regard to EU residents.
For technical and operational reasons, it may be necessary for your information to be transferred to (the servers of) companies affiliated to us located in the United States or other countries outside of the European Union.
If this is to happen, the information will also be saved in a foreign country.
Since legislation concerning data protection may then not offer the same protection as in the European Union, please be aware that non-PII and PII can be transferred to the United States or another country outside of Europe.
==========
Can this Privacy Policy be changed?
We reserve the right to change, update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time at our sole discretion, and will post any new Privacy Policy here.
Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately.
