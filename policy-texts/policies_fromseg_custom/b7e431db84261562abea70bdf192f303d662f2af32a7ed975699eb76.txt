Please read the following to understand our views 
and practices regarding personal information, and how they pertain to you as you use our various 
features and services.
This statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire Web site.

If 
you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact either The

WHAT INFORMATION DOES THE MOTLEY FOOL GATHER ABOUT YOU?
==========
We collect a limited amount of information about our readers, so that we can provide a 
site that is more interesting and useful, as well as provide advertising that is more appropriate for 
our readers.
The Motley Fool asks for your name, email address, and other personal information when 
you register to use our message boards, portfolios, or (eventually) chat areas, or if you sign up for 
any special or personalized service such as a subscription service.
We also may ask for such 
information at other times, such as whenever you enter sweepstakes or other promotions 
sponsored by The Motley Fool and/or our partners.
Sometimes we conduct surveys, too, 
although you don't have to respond to them.
We also collect IP addresses to help us understand how our audience uses our site, so that 
we can make our site better and improve our users' overall experience when they visit The 
Motley Fool.
==========
For these same reasons, if your browser is set up to accept them, we use a feature 
known as a "cookie."
Cookies contain bits of information that Web sites transfer to your 
computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.
Cookies can make the Web more useful by 
storing information about your preferences on a particular site such as ours.
Although we may 
assign your browser a cookie, it doesn't tell us who you are.
Only you can do that.
==========
HOW DOES THE MOTLEY FOOL USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
The Motley Fool collects personal information to provide you, the user, with the best and 
most personalized Web experience possible and to provide our advertisers with an efficient 
means to reach the right audience.
By knowing a little about you, The Motley Fool can deliver 
more relevant content and advertisements, and thus a better service to you while at our Web site.
==========
And it's free.
Sometimes we ask for personal information when providing special, personalized service.
If you don't want to give us that information, you certainly don't have to, but you may not be able 
to take advantage of certain products or services.
==========
For example, we can't ship a product to you 
unless you provide us with a shipping address; we can't track your personal stock portfolio unless 
you input the stocks you own.
Making A Purchase Through FoolMart

You may purchase our various products and merchandise through our FoolMart online 
store, www.foolmart.com.
If you place an order with FoolMart, we will collect personal 
information including your credit card number and shipping information and all of this 
information is encrypted, using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology.
==========
We will use this 
information only to fulfill your order and we will not share it with anyone outside of The Motley 
Fool, except as necessary to fulfill the order (for example, if we're shipping a Fool cap to you, 
we'll need to give your address to the fulfillment house and the U.S. postal service).
We'll use 
your information to contact you regarding your order should the need arise.
==========
We may also send 
you occasional notices about The Motley Fool or FoolMart products, unless you tell us not to.
If you wish to order online the books that are not published by The Motley Fool, those orders are 
filled by Amazon (www.amazon.com), which has its own privacy and data collection practices.
FoolMart does not collect, see or have access to any personal information you may provide to 
Amazon when purchasing these books.
==========
IP Addresses and Cookies

The Motley Fool collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and for 
studying how people use our site and how we can improve it.
Cookies are used on The Motley Fool in five main ways:

(1) We may use cookies to automatically access your previously stored account 
information when you log in to our site in order to deliver a better and more 
personalized service.
==========
(2) Cookies are used to estimate our audience size and usage patterns.
Each browser 
accessing The Motley Fool is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine 
usage patterns, and to help in targeting content and ads based on user interests.
(3) When you shop our FoolMart store, cookies help us keep track of your shopping cart 
and process your orders.
==========
(4) The Fool search engine uses cookies to expedite your search quickly through the 
many articles and board posts on our site.
(5) Advertising networks that serve ads onto our site may also use cookies but please 
note that we don't control, nor have access to those cookies.
Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to refuse 
cookies or to notify you when you've received one.
If you reject cookies, though, you will not be 
able to use certain areas of our site.
Even if you accept our cookies, unless you first tell us, we 
can't use them to find out who you really are and even then, it won't tell us what you're thinking, 
or to whom you're writing love letters.
==========
WILL THE MOTLEY FOOL DISCLOSE ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL 
INFORMATION?
The Motley Fool will not disclose any information about individual users, except as 
described in this Privacy Statement, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or 
to protect the rights or property of The Motley Fool.
We do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, only 
aggregate information.
==========
For example, we might tell advertisers that there are 120,000 Registered 
Fools in Metropolis, but we won't tell them that Superman is one of them, and we won't tell them 
that his email address is ckent@dailyplanet.com.
We may also use this aggregated information to 
help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want.
Advertisers may give us an ad and tell 
us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males in the 22314 zip code).
==========
The 
Motley Fool would then take the ad and display it to users who've told us they meet those 
criteria.
In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information.
Only 
The Motley Fool has access to individuals' accounts.
==========
We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, 35 million of our readers 
clicked on a message board advertisement last month) in order to describe our services to 
prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
We may disclose personal information in some limited circumstances, but we will 
specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a 
sweepstakes or some new service.
For example, if we're going to give personal information to 
the sponsor of a contest, we'll tell you that before you sign up for the contest, so that you can 
decide whether or not to enter.
==========
WILL THE MOTLEY FOOL USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR DIRECT MAILINGS?
If you register for our site or sign up for our personalized services, we will send you 
information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may 
interest you.
==========
Only The Motley Fool (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality 
agreements) will send you these direct mailings.
If you do not want to receive such offers and 
mailings, you can let us know by clicking the link below; or snail mail Privacy 
Pete at The Motley Fool, 123 N. Pitt Street; Alexandria, VA 22314.
We'll remove your name 
from our lists as soon as we can.
(It may take a little while.)

the unsubscribe link, which you will find on our email messages.

WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY?
The information you post on message boards, in chat rooms, and in such features as your 
Personal Profile or your Foolish Interview is visible to the public.
That's really the point of the 
profile, boards, chats, and interviews.
Please remember that whenever you disclose personal 
information publicly – for example, on message boards, through email, or in chat areas – that 
information can be collected and used by others.
In short, if you post personal information online 
that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
If you don't want strangers to send you email, don't post your email address on a message board.
Furthermore, while we do our best to protect your personal information, The Motley Fool 
cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your 
own risk.
==========
What does all this mean?
Just as in the investing world, you must protect yourself.
==========
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account 
information.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
==========
Many of our advertisers or partners, such as brokerages, merchants, or data providers link 
form our site to areas on their own sites where they sell their own goods and services.
If you 
follow these links from our site to theirs, you should be aware that these other sites have their 
privacy and data collection practices.
==========
The Motley Fool has no responsibility or liability for these 
independent policies.
For more information regarding a site and its privacy policies, check that 
site.
==========
Please note: once an account is created, we will send you a confirmation email 
acknowledging your new account to the address that you supplied us.
This email will give you 
the option to delete your account, in case you change your mind or in case you were not the one 
who created it in the first place.
You should keep the confirmation email as it will also contain 
information that will help you use our service.
