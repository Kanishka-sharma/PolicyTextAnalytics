YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, BY YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE RIGHTS ADDITIONAL TO THOSE CONTAINED HEREIN.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SECTION DOES NOT EXPAND OR LIMIT (i) ANY EXPRESS, WRITTEN PRODUCT WARRANTY OR RELATED DISCLAIMERS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY WHOLE FOODS MARKET PARTIES OR THEIR SUPPLIERS WITH REGARD TO A PHYSICAL PRODUCT SOLD BY WHOLE FOODS MARKET PARTIES TO YOU, OR ANY WARRANTY ON A PHYSICAL PRODUCT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW; (ii) WHOLE FOODS MARKET PARTIES’ LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY TO YOU CAUSED BY WHOLE FOODS MARKET PARTIES TO THE EXTENT NOT WAIVABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW; OR (iii) ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST WHOLE FOODS MARKET PARTIES THAT IS NOT WAIVABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
