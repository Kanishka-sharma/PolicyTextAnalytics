Privacy
CrownPeak Technology (“CrownPeak”) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
The following outlines our information gathering and dissemination practices; our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through this website www.crownpeak.com and other websites owned by CrownPeak accessible by our customers’ end users or by the general public.
These websites are collectively referred to in this privacy statement as “our website”, “this website” or their respective plurals.
Our use of information collected through our website shall be limited to the purposes outlined in the CrownPeak Services Agreement executed between CrownPeak and your company or, in the case of general public access, by the principles outlined in this privacy statement.
==========
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy statement and let us know if you have any questions.
Your privacy is important to us.
==========
To better protect your privacy we provide this statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
To make this statement easy to find, we make it available on our corporate website (http://www.crownpeak.com/privacy) and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
==========
To show our commitment to privacy, we have entered into three voluntary data privacy programs: the US-EU Safe Harbor, U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor and TRUSTe.
Our involvement and participation in these programs is described below.
==========
Safe Harbor
We follow privacy principles with respect to transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the twenty-seven member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and from Switzerland to the United States.
The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States (the “U.S.-EU Safe Harbor").
The EEA also has recognized the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47).
==========
The United States Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) of Switzerland have agreed on a similar set of principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under Swiss law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States (the “U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor”).
CrownPeak complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
CrownPeak has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view CrownPeak’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
==========
In compliance with the Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.
TRUSTe Privacy Seal
In addition, CrownPeak has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe Cloud Privacy program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.
TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.
==========
The TRUSTe program covers the collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our website and our CMS Platform.
The use of information collected through these services shall be limited either by the terms agreed to in contract between CrownPeak and its customers or as directly described in this privacy policy.

==========
It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, subpoena, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - for us to disclose your personal information.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our operations or those of our customers, and to protect your safety or the safety of others.
Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.

==========
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
==========
CrownPeak uses secure sockets layer (SSL) for securing communications and transactions across the Internet.
The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications between the browser and our web server.
Data transmitted over an SSL connection cannot be tampered with or forged without the two parties (you and CrownPeak) becoming immediately aware of the tampering.
==========
A key or padlock icon in the browser window identifies the security mode of most popular browsers.
When the browser is running in “normal” mode, the key is broken or the padlock is open.
==========
Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is now in “secure” mode.
SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption.
==========
CrownPeak uses certificates from well known providers of digital trust services that enable businesses and consumers to engage in commerce and communications with confidence.
For data collected by websites hosted by CrownPeak on behalf of its customers, CrownPeak ensures that all applicable Safe Harbor Principles are applied to the data for as long as it is hosted by CrownPeak and under CrownPeak’s control.
==========
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us.
For that reason, no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We and our third party tracking technology company use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are roughly the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based Emails to let us know which Emails have been opened by recipients.
==========
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
CrownPeak may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service.
==========
Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this privacy statement regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Licensees.
If we engage a third party to process your data on our behalf, that third party will also be bound by our privacy statement.
==========
CrownPeak will retain the personal data we collect from you for as long as needed to provide services to our customers or to support our own marketing programs as described above.
CrownPeak will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
==========
We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices.
If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective.
We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
