In addition, it is our policy not to share any data we collect with any third party companies, including service providers and advertising networks, other than our partners and clients.
Please note that at some of Simplifi’s partner or advertiser properties, users may be asked to register and provide personally identifiable data.
Although Simplifi is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers, the collection and use of such PII is controlled by the policies found on those sites.
Since Simplifi cannot control those third party sites, we recommend that you take appropriate steps to control the use of PII on third party sites.

==========
Non-Personal Information 
Passive Collection
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically.
This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
Tracking Technologies
Our third party vendors and we use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
In addition, we use persistent cookies to assist us with the collection and use of de-identified browsing data, including IP address and Cookie ID for online behavioral advertising (“OBA”) activities.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on a site.
Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
If you reject cookies, you may still navigate Websites, but your ability to use some areas of the site may be limited.
To learn more about our cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.
Local Storage
Our third party vendors may also use Local Storage/HTML5 to collect and store information in order to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity.
==========
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
Opting Out of Simplifi Cookies To Stop Receiving Online Behavioral Advertising From Us

If you would like to disable your unique Simplifi cookie, simply click here.
By doing so, Simplifi will replace your unique cookie with an “opt-out” cookie that will prevent us from serving you online behavioral advertising.
We will still collect and store information through such cookies for metrics and analytics purposes and we may still serve you advertising, but not based on such information.
==========
Because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser on your computer, you will need to disable the Simplifi cookie while using the other browser(s) in order to opt-out completely.
To do so, point each browser that you use to this page, and click on the disable link above.
Please note that you will need to set the Simplifi opt-out cookie again under the following circumstances: You buy a new computer or upgrade the browser of your existing computer.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) 

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the advertising content on our network of third-party sites.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personally identifiable information.
==========
In performing our Advertising Services, we collect non-personally identifiable consumer information in multiple ways, including:

on our own web sites
on the web sites of publishers or Advertising Customers that call our pixels (or “beacons”)
when we serve online advertisements, and
from third party providers

This de-identified data includes, but is not limited to, information such as a web visitor’s web pages which have been viewed by a web visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor.
As the Internet evolves, we may use different types of technologies to collect these types of de-identified, non-personally identifiable information.
The collection of this de-identified data allows us and our advertisers to better target advertising to user interests.
The data also allows us provide improvements to our services, for example, improving the effectiveness of the advertisements delivered to users and limiting the number of times a person sees a given advertisement.
Opting Out of Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) To Stop Receiving Behavioral Advertising From Us

If you do not want us to use de-identified data that relates to your use of the Internet to serve you online behavioral advertising, please click here: Opt-Out.
We will still collect and store information through such clear gifs for metrics and analytics purposes and we may still serve you advertising, but not based on such information.
JavaScript 

We also use JavaScript to assist us with the collection and use of de-identified browsing data, including IP address and Cookie ID for OBA activities.
Data Retention 

We will retain the information your provide to the Site for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
We retain the information we collect through our Advertising Services for 30 days.
==========
Security

Simplifi uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and to protect it against loss or unauthorized use or disclosure.
As the Internet is not 100% secure, we cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Simplifi and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission of information, Simplifi makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
==========
Information Sharing and Disclosure 

We will not sell, trade or share your Personal Information with other companies for their promotional purposes.
We share your Personal Information with our third party vendors who provide services on our behalf, such as an email marketing company who distributes our newsletters to our users, and our third party payment processors who process your transactions.
These companies are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Information that we collect through our Advertising Services is shared with and disclosed to our Advertising Customers to enable them to serve targeted advertisements to user devices based on the user’s browsing history and online activities.
As stated above, only de-identified, Non-Personal Information is collected by the Advertising Services.
==========
Simplifi may also disclose any information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Simplifi, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Simplifi; (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Simplifi, its websites or the public; (4) to provide updates and services that may be of interest to the customer; or (5) prevent online fraud or other cyber threats, for example through an online threat exchange, or to report, detect and/or prevent security events.
Simplifi is required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In the events above, you will be notified via email of such disclosure, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, in accordance with applicable law.
Sale of Assets 

In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets related to the business, we reserve the right to include, disclose and transfer any or all stored Non-Personal and Personal Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.
If Simplifi is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.
==========
International or Cross-Border Transfer of Your Personal Information and Your Express Agreement 

Given that the Internet operates in a global environment and that transfer of your data is necessary to provide you with requested services, to provide updates, to respond to your inquiries, and to provide Advertising Services, using the Internet to collect and process Personal Information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international, or cross-border, basis.
By providing Personal Information and/or by communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing and disclosure of your Personal Information in this way.
The Personal Information of users who are located outside the U.S. may be transferred outside of each eligible country to the U.S., where our servers are located and where it will be processed and stored on servers in the U.S.
The U.S. has not been recognized as providing an adequate level of protection according to EU data protection requirements, but we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that users’ Personal Information is treated securely in respect of such transfer and as described in this Privacy Policy.
By accessing the Site, using Advertising Services, providing Personal Information or sending us email, you expressly and unambiguously agree to such transfer, processing, storage and disclosure in countries outside the EU.
==========
Social Media Widgets

Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, and Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website.
These Features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.

Advertising Services; Collecting Information on Users’ Online Activities Across Devices Over Time

Simplifi provides its online Advertising Services to Advertising Customers through site retargeting, search retargeting, contextual retargeting, Facebook API and the collection of location data (“GeoFencing”) of Internet users.
These services are provided through third party websites owned and operated by our Advertising Customers who publish their own content on the Internet.
Through our Advertising Services, we collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information regarding users’ online activities over time and across non-affiliated web sites, mobile applications, or online services, as applicable, and across multiple devices.
We collect this information for the purposes of predicting user preferences or interests so our Ad Serving Customers can deliver advertising to a user’s computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from his/her online activities.

Mobile Advertising ID’s and Opting Out from Advertising Most devices come with an identifier for advertising purposes that allows advertisers to track and identify users’ consumer interests, and which also provide an opt out.
For iOS:Every iOS device comes with an identifier for advertising (IDFA), which has two key features:

It can be reset by the user at any time.
Users can opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called “Limit Ad Tracking” (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising.
