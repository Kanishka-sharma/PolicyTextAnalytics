What are cookies and online tracking technologies?
Web Browser Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is sent by a website to your computer or mobile device where it is stored by your web browser.
A cookie contains limited non-personal data, usually a unique identifier and the name of the site.
This enables a website to recognise you as you move around the site and/or each time you revisit.
==========
Cookies are used for a wide variety of purposes such as to keep you logged in or to remember what’s in your basket if you’re shopping online, to remember your preferences and settings, to analyse how the site is used by you, and to serve advertising to you.
Cookies may be served to you by the website you are visiting (a “first party cookie”) or by another organisation providing services to that website, such as an analytics company or advertising network (a “third party cookie”).
They will either be stored for the duration of your visit (a “session cookie”) or they will remain on your device for a fixed period, which could be months or even years, to remember you across multiple browsing sessions (a “persistent cookie”).
==========
Other types of local storage, such as Flash Cookies and HTML5 Storage
Many websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video and game content to their users.
Adobe utilise their own cookies which are used by the Flash Player to store data such as your preferences, and your viewing and browsing history.
HTML5 Storage is similar in concept to browser cookies in that the data is stored in your browser’s files, and it is used for similar purposes, however as this storage enables website publishers to store greater amounts of data, they will often use it to store usage data and preferences (alongside the unique ID usually stored in a cookie) instead of on their own systems.
==========
Tracking technologies: web beacons/GIFs, page tags, script
Web pages, emails and mobile apps may contain a small transparent image file or line of code to record how you interact with them.
They are often used in conjunction with web browser cookies (or the unique identifier of your mobile device) and they are used to help website and app publishers to better analyse and improve their services and to target advertising based on your browsing behaviour and interests.
For example by knowing which web pages you visit or which elements of a page you viewed, when and for how long, whether you viewed and/or clicked on an advert on the site or whether you opened or clicked on marketing emails sent to you.
==========
Tracking wia mobile apps
When you use our Mobile Apps we may record unique identifiers associated with your device (such as the device ID, IP address, MAC address or IMEI number), your activity within the App and your network location.
This information may be used to analyse and improve our services and, for Apps supported by advertising, to serve advertising to you.
For more information about information we collect from your use of our Apps, please see our Mobile Apps Privacy Policy.

How we use cookies on our online services
We use cookies and tracking technologies for a variety of reasons such as to enable us to recognise when you have logged in, to improve your experience of the services and to deliver advertising.
In particular, we use these technologies for:
·       Strictly Necessary Purposes: to keep you logged in, to facilitate a purchase, to improve the security of our services and for system administration, such as preventing fraudulent or disruptive activity;
·       Functionality Purposes: to remember your preferences and settings and other functionality you have requested such as remembering your username and password so that you do not need to login each time you visit;
·       Analytics and Performance-Related Purposes: to record what you like and don’t like on the website and the popularity of various elements of the website so that we can ensure that it works properly at points of high usage.
We also use analytics companies to gather information regarding users of our services on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website.
==========
·       Advertising Purposes: some of our websites contain advertising and all advertising that is served on our websites will be clearly marked with the word “Advertisement”.
Cookies and tracking technologies may sometimes be used to deliver advertising and marketing messages relevant to you - a common practice across the internet and known as online behavioural advertising.
More information about analytics and advertising is detailed below.
Analytics on our services
On our websites we use Google Analytics, and other similar services, to collect statistical information about how our websites are used.
They use information such as your IP address, browser type and unique identifiers stored in (first party) cookies on your device to record how you interact with our website.
On some services we also use Google Demographics and Interests data gathered via the Google DoubleClick cookie.
We only use this data in aggregate form and we do not merge it with any other data we hold, however it is important to note that these reports are derived from Google’s (third party) DoubleClick cookie and device identifiers, which are also used for advertising.
These analytical services help us to know how many users we have, which parts of our sites are most popular, what browsers are used (so we can maximise compatibility), the country or region where our users are located, and the demographics and interests of our users.
This enables us to better understand who is using our site and to ensure we are reaching our target demographic, and to improve and tailor our services accordingly.

Advertising on our services
Some of our services carry targeted or behavioural advertising, as well as non-targeted advertising, which helps us to pay for the delivery of these services to you.
Our advertising partners use cookies accompanying the adverts to enable them and their advertisers to monitor the effectiveness of their ads (e.g. by using statistical analysis cookies).
==========
We may also use cookies and your IP address to discover general information about which pages on our sites you visit and the country, city or region in which you are located.
We sometimes combine this with information provided to us by third parties, together this information enables you to be grouped with other people with similar interests and places you in a market segment, such as “travel”, “autos”, or .
We may then display advertisements which we believe people in your market segment will find relevant.
We believe this makes the advertising more interesting and useful to you, and also helps us increase the value we get out of the site from our advertisers, and therefore ultimately gives us a greater ability to invest in great content for the benefit of all users.
We may also allow advertisers to use their own marketing data to target advertising campaigns on this website and as a result you may see advertising based upon website content you have been viewing on another website.
For example, a retailer might use information about the products you browsed on their website in order to tailor their advert to you on this website.
This information is not shared with us and we do not share information with the advertiser about your browsing of our website.
It is important to note that at no time do we or our service providers attempt to identify you individually nor do we create a profile of you for the purposes of delivering advertising.
We are committed to following best practice in our use of online behavioural targeting technology and we at all times seek to comply with applicable regulatory frameworks, such as that of the European Digital Advertising Alliance.

Web browser cookies: You can choose how web browser cookies are handled by your device via your browser settings including to refuse or delete all cookies.
If you choose not to receive cookies at any time, the website may not function properly and certain services will not be provided.
Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences or follow the instructions provided at: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/, which provides information for the most common browsers.
Local Storage (Flash and HTML5): The most common browsers clear your locally stored data when you choose to delete/clear your cookies and web browsing data; consult the Help function of your browser for more details.
Alternatively, you can manage which websites can store information (and how much) in Flash cookies by visiting the settings panel on the Adobe website.
The ‘Do Not Track (DNT) function on your web browser
DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.
This website does not currently respond to DNT requests, however, you may opt-out of tracking for analytics and advertising purposes using the links provided above.
A uniform standard has not yet been adopted to determine how DNT requests should be interpreted and what actions should be taken by websites and third parties.
We will continue to review DNT and other new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once available.
