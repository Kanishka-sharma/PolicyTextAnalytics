Ogury Product Privacy Statement
Last Updated: 1 January 2020
Ogury Limited (“Ogury”, “we” or “us”) cares about its users’ privacy and is committed to clearly describing and disclosing its data practices.
Welcome to Ogury
Ogury is a mobile advertising technology company.
==========
We develop and maintain software code that mobile app publishers and developers ("Publishers") integrate into their apps ("Apps") to manage your consent choices and show ads which are placed by advertisers and advertising agencies (together “Partner(s)”).
We use this software code, together with tracking cookies, pixels and similar technologies (“Ogury Technologies”) to provide Ogury’s products for Publishers including Active Insights, Choice Manager and Intelligent Monetization and User Engagement – in this Privacy Statement, we call these solutions the “Ogury Product”.
After receiving user consent, Ogury collects certain data ("User Data") relating to the user of the tablet, mobile or handheld device (“Device”) on using the Ogury Technologies.
We may also supplement User Data obtained via Ogury Technologies with further data relating to Users obtained from other companies that share User Data with us.
The User Data we collect is described in this Privacy Statement (see the heading "What is User Data?")
, and we only collect User Data with consent from the relevant Device user.
==========
Your consent applies across to all Apps you have installed (or may in future install) that contain Ogury Technologies.
This Ogury Product Privacy Statement explains how Ogury collects, stores, uses, and shares User Data (including personal information) from users who have installed Apps on their Devices.
California residents can find details about their rights and how we comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) here.
==========

What Is User Data?
Ogury collects User Data through the Ogury Technologies as well as obtaining additional data from third parties, however, we do this only where Users have consented to this collection.
The User Data we collect comprises the following categories of information:
Usage Data
We collect data about how Users use their Devices, together with the applications and systems on those Devices – this information includes:
What websites Users have bookmarked in their mobile browser.
==========
Which websites/URLs Users have visited and information related to these URLs.
What applications are installed on the Users’ Device.
Users’ usage levels of these applications.
==========
The Usage Data collected by the Ogury Technologies is not limited to Usage Data that directly relates to the App in which the Ogury Technologies are integrated.
Rather, the Ogury Technologies collect Usage Data from all applications and systems on the Device on which an App is installed.
Technical Information
We collect technical Information relating to Users' Devices, that includes:
The type of Device being used (including manufacturer and model).
The version number of the Ogury Technologies used by the App.
A User’s network status (limited to connection type; gsm, 3G, 4G/wifi etc).
==========
Identifiers
Ogury links the Usage Data and Technical Information it collects listed above to certain device and user identifiers it collects from Users and their Devices, which include:
the User's email address & other mobile advertising identifiers on the Device (Ogury collects this information only where a User’s Device allows it through the Publisher Apps in order to derive insights such as gender and then we anonymise the email addresses after 3 days).
your Device’s unique Advertising ID, such as Google AAID or Apple IDFA.
==========
All User Data we collect is associated with these Identifiers.
Cross Device Linking
We also collect and infer data (either ourselves or from other companies) about the links between different Devices, such as a mobile phone and tablet, where we believe they are being used by single User.
==========
We do this using of cookies, Advertising IDs and other User Data we collect.
Ad engagement information
To enable Ogury and its Partners to provide more personalised Ogury ads to Users (as described in the "How is User Data used?"
section below) and to report ad engagement metrics back to our Partners, we collect information on how Users engage with Ogury ads that are displayed to them, including:
What each Ogury ad is about.
The format of each Ogury ad (e.g., text, image, or video).
Where the Ogury ad is displayed within an App or elsewhere.
==========
User interaction with the Ad (for example, clicks and how long the Ad was displayed for).
User interaction with Partner sites after clicking on an Ogury ad.
In addition, we combine this Ad Engagement Information with Usage Data collected about Users to determine what Users do when interacting with or after viewing each Ogury ad – for example, to identify whether a User proceeded to buy the product or services that were displayed to them in an Ogury ad.
Crash reporting information
To enable Ogury and its Partners to help to improve the Ogury Technologies and Product and resolve technical problems, we collect information in cases where the App has crashed, including: date and time of the crash, Advertising ID, API key, app package name and version, phone model, phone android version and a crash message.
==========
Other information
User Data includes any other information (including personal data) that may be submitted to us directly (for example, through a User submitted form or survey response).
Our policy towards children
In accordance with applicable European Union guidance on the practice, we do not knowingly collect User Data from children or use any User Data to target adverts to children.
Accordingly, we do not collect or use User Data to target Ogury ads to children under 16 years old.
==========
If you believe we have inadvertently collected User Data from or about a child, please contact us using the details provided under the heading "Contact Us" below.
How is User Data used?
In simple terms – User Data is used by Ogury and its Partners to (i) manage your privacy choices relating to Ogury, Publishers and Partners use of User Data; (ii) link your Devices and browsers; and (iii) select and serve to Users adverts based on how they use their Device.
==========
Adverts of this nature are commonly referred to as “interest-based advertisements” or “behavioural advertising”.
For more information on interest-based advertising, how it works, and information on choices about how Users can interact with it, Users can go to http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/.
This is a helpful guide made available by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance a cross-industry coalition of European-level associations with an interest in delivering a responsible European Self-Regulatory Programme for Online Behavioural Advertising, which benefits internet users with greater transparency, choice and control.
==========
We also use User Data to analyse the performance of Ogury ads and how Users interact with them and Partners’ websites, cap the number of times that Users see an Ogury Ad, so they do not see the same one too many times or too frequently.
User Data is also used to create aggregated compilations of Users which are “deidentified” for the purposes of reporting to Partners; in a manner which prevents that User Data from being associated with, or capable of being associated with, any particular Device, Partner or App (“Aggregated Data”).
In addition, Ogury also uses User Data for its internal purposes which may include:
performing analysis and research aimed at improving the Ogury Technologies and Products and the services and products Ogury provides to its Partners; and
ensuring we get paid properly by advertisers for the Ogury ads we deliver, and that we pay Publishers and other suppliers properly for the Ogury ads displayed in their Apps or websites; and
security and fraud detection (e.g. protecting against click-fraud and similar unlawful activities).
==========
Our approach to consent
We respect your right to privacy.
That's why we ask Users to give their consent before Ogury starts to collect any User Data from them.
In addition, Users may opt-out of such collection at any time by following the instructions outlined at the section titled “Opting Out of Ogury Interest-based Advertising”.
==========
Accordingly, when Users use a version of an App which contains the Ogury Technologies, a page is displayed which notifies them that, with their consent, certain User Data will be collected by the Ogury Technologies unless and until they subsequently opt-out from such collection.
So that Users are fully and properly informed about our data usage practices and how their User Data is collected, stored, used and shared, they are also provided with a link to this Privacy Statement.
If Users do not give consent, Ogury will not collect their User Data and will not deliver them targeted Ogury ads.
However, Users will still see advertisements in their App, but the advertisements they see will not be tailored to them based on their User Data.
We also keep records of the Advertising ID to allow us to identify which Users have opted out.
Ogury is a member of the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework and we may share your consent preferences with other IAB approved members in order to meet transparency and user choice requirements.
==========
