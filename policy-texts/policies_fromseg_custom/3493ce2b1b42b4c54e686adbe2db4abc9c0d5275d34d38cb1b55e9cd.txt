Cookies
A cookie is a small piece of computer code that enables Web servers to "identify" visitors.
When a user visits a Web site that uses cookie technology, the Web site adds a cookie to the user's browser that includes identification information, which is then stored on the user's desktop.
==========
Each time the user initiates a session on our Web site, the site sets the cookie in order to identify the user and his/her access privileges on the site.
Cookies can contain only as much information as you provide to the site.
You have the ability to delete cookie files from your hard drive at any time.
==========
However, you should know that cookies may be necessary to provide you access to content or features available on GartnerGroup Interactive.
GartnerGroup uses cookie technology to enable users who register to move quickly and securely through access-controlled areas of the site.
It also allows us to provide users with secure and authenticated access to GartnerGroup research that they own, allowing them to move freely between research articles without verifying their usernames each time.
Cookie technology also enables all registered users to take advantage of features on the site such as "Search", "Browse" and "Profiling" as well as customized features including "Personal Home Page", "E-mail Notification" and "Usage Reporting".

Data Security
GartnerGroup provides its registered users with a secure online experience by utilizing a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.
All user registration information is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to production systems.
==========
Passwords and credit card numbers are encrypted in GartnerGroup's secure database, which is also located behind a firewall.
All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted in GartnerGroup's database as stated above.
Accessing or Changing Your Personal Information
If you wish to modify your personal/registration information, you may do so at any time by visiting the Client Services page on GartnerGroup Interactive.
==========
Unsubscribing From an E-mail List
Even after submitting your E-mail address to receive one of our subscriber E-mails or Profiling notification E-mails, you have the option to opt-out at ANY TIME.
To unsubscribe from a subscriber E-mail list, send your request to unsubscribe@gartner.com.
