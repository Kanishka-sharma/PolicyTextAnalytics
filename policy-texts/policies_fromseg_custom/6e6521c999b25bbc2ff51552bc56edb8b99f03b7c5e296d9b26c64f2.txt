Opting-Out from Targeted Advertisements and Tracking on Websites
You can opt-out from tracking and Adform’s unique cookie identifiers here.
To do so, click the button at your right once and we will take all necessary means to ensure that no tracking is being applied.
Please be aware that:
1.
==========
Adform needs to set an anonymous “opt-out” cookie to indicate your decision not to be tracked.
Your opt-out will remain in effect only as long as this cookie is present in your browser and accessible to Adform.
2.
Cookies are browser and device-specific – opting out of tracking on this browser and device does not affect your settings on a secondary device and/or browser.
3.
Some browsers (e.g. Safari) limit cookie functionalities by default – in consequence, your opt-out may not work as intended.
4.
==========
When you opt-out, any data we hold will be disassociated from your browser and device and not used for ad targeting anymore.
You will still continue to see advertising – it may just be less relevant and useful to you than before.
Opting-Out from Advertising and Tracking in Mobile Applications 
For opt-out of ad tracking and targeting on many mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads, Android devices, TV streaming devices, or other Smart TV devices, you should preferably consult your device settings and instructions provided by the device manufacturer.
