Introduction
TRUSTe’s TRUSTed Data Program Requirements apply to companies who help in the optimization or serving of an online advertisement.
These Program Requirements set the standard for responsible third party data collection practices by Ad Companies addressing Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA).
This provides Ad Companies who lack a direct relationship with an Individual a way to demonstrate they use data collected from web sites or mobile applications, or data received from different sources in a manner that respects an Individual’s preference.
==========
The Trusted Data Program Requirements are based upon a philosophy of notice and choice that gives Individuals control over the use of their information for OBA purposes.
This is accomplished by providing:

Notice - in a contextually relevant manner; and
Choice – easy access to a preference mechanism for persisting and honoring an Individual’s OBA preferences

OBA practices and technologies, along with Individual preference management controls continue to evolve rapidly.
==========
Accordingly, TRUSTe may continue to refine and evolve the Trusted Data Program Requirements based on the changing requirements of global OBA compliance frameworks.
The Trusted Data Program is a single program that sets forth requirements consistent with regulatory guidelines such as the Federal Trade Commission’s Self-Regulatory Guidelines on OBA, and self-regulatory frameworks such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) OBA, multi-site, and mobile principles, and the European DAA and DAA Canada OBA Principles.
In addition, Ad Companies certified under these program requirements will be certified to a standard consistent with the Network Advertising Initiative’s 2013 Code of Conduct and Mobile Application Code.
Terms defined in Section III of these Program Requirements are bolded the first time they appear in this document.
==========
