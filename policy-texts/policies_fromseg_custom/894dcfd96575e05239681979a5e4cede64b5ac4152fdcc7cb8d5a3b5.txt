==========
BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS
7.1 Billing and Payments.
The Service is made available on a pay-as-you-go basis and is charged at the start of Your elected subscription term (generally monthly or annually).
If You do not provide Your credit card or other payment information to Zendesk before the expiration of any free trial period, Your account will be suspended until payment information and charge authorization are provided.
You will be promptly billed and, if applicable, any trial period will terminate.
==========
Thereafter, Your subscription will renew automatically based on Your plan’s renewal cycle.
The Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal).
The account owner will receive a receipt upon each payment received, or they may obtain a receipt from within the application to be able to track the status of Your subscription.
7.2 Modifying Your Subscription.
==========
If You choose to upgrade Your plan or number of agents during Your elected subscription period, any incremental cost will be prorated over the remaining term of the subscription period and charged to Your account.
Subsequently, You will be charged the adjusted rate on Your next billing cycle.
If You are on a monthly billing cycle, You will not see a prorated charge or credit in the current month, but Your new billing rate will be reflected on Your next monthly bill.
Regardless of Your billing cycle, there are no refunds or credits for partial months of Service, plan downgrades, or refunds for unused time if You close Your account before the end of Your subscription period.
No exceptions will be made in order to treat everyone equally and keep Our administrative costs low for the ultimate benefit of Our customer base.
Downgrading Your plan level may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of Your account and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss.
Zendesk reserves the right to contact You about special pricing if You maintain an exceptionally high number of end-users, an unusually high monthly ticket ratio per agent, an unusually high level of open tickets or other excessive stress on the Service.
7.3 Overdue charges.
If You fail to pay your subscription fee on time, or if Your credit card payment information is entered in error or does not go through for processing and You do not update payment information upon Our request, your entire subscription may be suspended or cancelled.
==========
7.4 Billing Privacy.
Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Zendesk.
For more information about Our billing practices and Your personal information please visit Our Privacy Policy.
==========
7.5 Taxes.
Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”).
You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against Zendesk based on its income.
We will invoice You for such Taxes if we believe we have a legal obligation to do so.
8.

VOICE FUNCTIONALITY
If Your plan allows You to use Our Zendesk Voice™ service, You understand and agree that (a) the Service is not intended to support or carry emergency calls to any emergency services such as public safety answering points, (b) Zendesk will not be held liable for any claim, damages or loss (and You hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action), arising from or relating to Your (or Your customers’) inability to use Your Service subscription to make such emergency calls, (c) You are solely responsible for Your operation of Zendesk Voice in compliance with all applicable laws in Your jurisdiction, including but not limited to telephone recording and wiretapping laws, and (d) You will defend, hold harmless and indemnify Zendesk from and against any third party claim arising from any of the foregoing.

If You cancel the Service before the end of Your current paid-up subscription period, Your cancellation will take effect immediately and You will not be charged again.
9.2 Zendesk reserves the right to (i) modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) and (ii) refuse any/all current and future use of the Service, suspend or terminate your account or any part thereof (or Your use of the Service), and remove and discard any of Your content within the Service if We believe that You have violated these Terms.
Zendesk will use all reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to warn You prior to suspension or termination of Your account.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, ZENDESK’S (INCLUDING ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES) AGGREGATE LIABILITY, FOR DAMAGES (MONETARY OR OTHERWISE) UNDER THESE TERMS CLAIMED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING FROM OUR SERVICE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF (I) ACTUAL DAMAGES INCURRED, OR (II) PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU FOR THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 11.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES CHARGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN.
