Introduction
NVIDIA® is committed to implementing appropriate protections for any Personal Information that our users share with us.
NVIDIA's Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy set forth our policies and procedures regarding our collection, use, and/or sharing of your Personal Information.
==========
What Information We May Collect
When users visit our website or mobile apps, we may collect "Personal Information," which is any information that can be used to identify a particular individual, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or other contact information.
In addition, we may collect information about your visits to our websites, including the pages you view, the links and ads you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with NVIDIA websites.
We may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our website, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our website and to which URL you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site.
When other non-public information, such as product preferences, hobbies or browsing history, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, that other information is treated as Personal Information.
Please note: The NVIDIA Online Store is managed independently by Digital River, Inc., and is subject exclusively to the Digital River Privacy Statement.

Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information
NVIDIA respects your choices about how your Personal Information is used when you register with us, elect to receive our newsletters, or provide us with Personal Information for other purposes.
If you choose not to provide any Personal Information when requested on the website, you can still enjoy most areas on the website.
However, you may be unable to access certain areas and services that require our interaction with you.
==========
Marketing communications.
You can opt-out of receiving communications from NVIDIA at any time by unsubscribing at http://www.nvidia.com/object/opt-out.html, or by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any e-mail you receive.
However, we may still send you updates to our Legal Notices, Online Privacy Policy, or regarding any account you have created with us.
Online advertising and other tracking.
==========
As discussed above, NVIDIA collects certain information about you when you visit our websites or services through technology like cookies, web beacons and similar tools.
Because we use this information only for internal and analytic purposes, your selection of the "Do Not Track" option provided by your browser will not have any effect on our collection of cookie information for these purposes.
The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device.
To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through browser settings.
We permit third party ad networks and social media companies to use cookies, plug-ins and other technology to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites when you visit our Site.
For example, we use advertising services provided by third party ad partners to employ cookies and other tracking technology to market our services to you on other websites.
==========
We do not control the opt-out mechanisms of these third party ad partners.
To avoid tracking by these third party ad partners, you can change your browser settings to reject cookies or to notify you when cookies are set and you could select the Do Not Track option on your browser, though we have no control over and cannot confirm whether these third parties honor the Do Not Track browser signal.
Additionally, many advertising companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) which provide opt-outs for member companies at www.networkadvertising.org/choices or www.aboutads.info/choices.

These social media sites may automatically record information about your browsing behavior every time you visit a site that has a social media button, regardless of whether you click on the button.
