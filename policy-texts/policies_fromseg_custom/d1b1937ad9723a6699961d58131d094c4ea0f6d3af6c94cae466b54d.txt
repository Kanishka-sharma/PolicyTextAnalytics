Microsoft.com Statement of Privacy
The Internet is an amazing tool.
With only a few mouse-clicks, 
you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and 
communicate with others around the world.
It's important to Microsoft to 
help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the 
Internet has to offer.
To protect your privacy, microsoft.com follows five principles in accordance 
with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.
==========
PRINCIPLE 1 - NOTICE
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you 
(Personal Information) or allows us to contact you.
Generally this information 
is requested when you are asked to register before downloading free software, 
entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters or joining a limited-access 
premium site.
We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes: 

To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
==========
To help you quickly find software, services or information on microsoft.com.
To help us create content most relevant to you.
To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and 
other new services from Microsoft.
PRINCIPLE 2 - CONSENT
If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still 
use most of microsoft.com.
But you will not be able to access areas that 
require registration.
==========
If you decide to register, you will be able to select the information you 
want to receive from microsoft.com by subscribing to various services, like 
our electronic newsletters.
If you do not want microsoft.com to communicate 
with you about other offers regarding Microsoft products, programs, events, 
or services by e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, you may visit the microsoft.com 
Profile Center, 
and establish your preferences in the  
Newsletters and Contact Options sections.
microsoft.com occasionally allows other companies to offer our registered 
customers information about their products and services, using postal mail 
only.
If you do not want to receive these offers, you should uncheck the 
Contact Options section stating, "Microsoft partners can send me postal mail 
about their services or products."
==========
PRINCIPLE 3 - ACCESS
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information 
is correct and current.
You may review and update this information at any 
time at the Profile Center.
The Profile Center is akin to a visitor center.
There, you can:

View and edit personal information you have already given us.
Tell us whether you want microsoft.com to send you marketing information, 
or whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail.
Subscribe or cancel subscriptions to electronic newsletters about our services and products.
==========
PRINCIPLE 4 - SECURITY
microsoft.com strictly protects the security of your personal information and 
honors your choices for its intended use.
We carefully protect your data 
from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or 
destruction.
PRINCIPLE 5 - ENFORCEMENT
If for some reason you believe microsoft.com has not adhered to these 
principles, please notify us by e-mail at 
homepage@microsoft.com, 
and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly.
==========
Be 
certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.
NOTICE TO PARENTS
Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children's privacy.
We 
encourage you to talk to your children about safe and responsible use of 
their Personal Information while using the Internet.
You can find a wealth of 
information at the microsoft.com Internet Safety site.
==========
ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION
When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your 
purchase electronically.
When you do, we merge your registration information 
with any information you've already left with us (we call that information 
your personal profile).
If you haven't previously registered with us, we 
create a personal profile for you from your product registration information.
If you ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the 
Profile Center 
and edit any of the Personal Information in your 
profile.
If you haven't already registered by giving us your e-mail address 
and a password, we will ask you to do so.
This ensures that only you can 
access your information.
CUSTOMER PROFILES
Microsoft uses Microsoft Passport as our log-on service.
When you sign on, 
you will be asked for an e-mail address and password to authenticate you.
Your Passport sign-on allows you access to Microsoft sites and many other 
participating sites on the Web.
Learn more about Passport and be sure to read how Passport protects your privacy.
==========
As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile.
Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps 
us ensure that only you can access your profile.
When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification 
number, then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive 
in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code.
This code is 
uniquely yours.
It enables seamless travel across Microsoft, allowing you 
to download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium sites 
without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already 
provided.
Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register - just 
use your Passport and password to identify yourself.
==========
Be sure to read our privacy FAQ below: 

Q: Does the site track my visit on Microsoft.com?
A:To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, microsoft.com collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies.
When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer’s machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously.
Clear gif technology, also known as a web beacon or action tag, assists in delivering the cookie.
This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a microsoft.com Web page.
We aggregate all usage information, which means we do not track individuals' use of the site.
We never share tracking information outside of Microsoft, and do not allow other companies to place clear gifs on our sites.
==========
Q: What is a cookie, and how does a cookie affect my privacy?
A: Please read our separate q/a about cookies.
It should help you 
understand how cookies help you navigate our site.
Q: How exactly does registration information help you provide me better 
content?
A: Today, the microsoft.com site is comprised of more than 700,000 Web pages 
of content.
That's equivalent to more than 700 very thick novels.
Finding 
what you need among those pages can be intimidating.
==========
But when you tell us 
about yourself - for example, that you're an IT professional - we can suggest 
content you might find useful.
The better we know you, the more specific 
information we can suggest.
If you want us to, we will also send you product 
or information updates that help you stay abreast of changes in your industry.
Q: How can I quit a registration wizard before finishing, and what happens to 
the information I've already typed in?
A: If you begin a microsoft.com registration form, then decide you don't want to finish it, 
just click the cancel button on the bottom of the page.
==========
You will be delivered 
to the entry page of the Profile Center.
None of the information entered on 
the page where you quit the wizard will be saved.
However, information 
entered on previous pages of that wizard, if any, will be saved in our 
database.
Q: What is microsoft.com doing to assure customers they will honor all the 
principles in the privacy policy?
==========
A: Microsoft is a member of TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit initiative 
that exists to help people feel confident about using the Internet for 
communication, shopping, research, and so on.

confidence by promoting the principles of disclosure and fair information 
practices among the Web sites that participate in the program.

can get anywhere.
