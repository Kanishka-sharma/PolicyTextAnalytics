You may opt-out of the tailoring of advertising based on information we collect.
==========
We also use technology services (for example, Google Adwords) to advertise to users of our Platform on websites owned or operated by other entities.

These technology services may include cookies to track your activities across time and services.

We may use data we receive these technology services to match multiple devices associated with the same identifier as devices belonging to the same user or household.
Where we are able to make such a match, we may use this information to deliver targeted advertisements across multiple devices on behalf of ourselves or other entities (“Interest-based Advertising”).
Any data collected by technology services will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of such technology services.

==========
We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Services or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”).

For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Service and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences.
Some technology services may provide us with their own data, which is then uploaded into another technology service for matching common factors between those datasets.
As indicated above, vendors may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.
We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
For Google Adwords, you can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.

==========
We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days.
We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request.
If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests to know or delete.
==========
Right to Opt-Out.
To the extent Food52 sells your personal information as the term “sell” is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by us to third parties at any time.
You may submit a request to opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information.
You may also submit a request to opt-out by emailing us at [email protected].
==========
We participate in the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s CCPA Compliance Framework for Publishers & Technology Companies (“IAB Framework”).
This means that where you exercise your right to opt-out of the sale your personal information by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information, to the extent we sell your personal information in order to deliver ads tailored to your interests, we will notify downstream participants of the IAB Framework that receive personal information about you to only use your personal information for the limited purposes that are permitted under the IAB Framework.
Please note that the scope of the IAB Framework opt-out may only apply to personal information from the specific browser or device from which you opt-out.
In addition, exercising your right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information does not mean that you will stop seeing ads or that you will stop seeing interest-based ads.
To learn more about interest-based advertising across sites and additional opt-out choices, please see the “Analytics and Advertising” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections above and the links set forth therein.
Where you opt-out of the sale for purposes of the CCPA, but do not opt-out of interest-based advertising more generally, you may continue to receive ads tailored to your interests based upon personal information not sold by us, sold to other IAB participants at least 90 days before you opted out, or sold by other sources from which you have not opted out.
We are not responsible for any downstream participants’ compliance with the IAB Framework or the accuracy of their privacy policies or statements regarding their opt-out options or programs.
==========
Authorized Agent.
You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.
However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.
Right to Non-Discrimination.
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any your rights.
==========
Financial Incentives.
Financial incentives are programs, benefits, or other offerings, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, or sale of personal information about them.
We may offer discounted prices to consumers who sign up to be on our mailing lists, or provide promotional discounts for participating in our “Refer a Friend” program.
In the “Refer a Friend” program you will receive $20 in shop credit when your friends register with Food52 and make their first purchase of $50 or more via your personal link.
All credits are subject to review and approval per our terms of service, and may be subject to minimum purchase restrictions.
==========
You are only eligible to receive shop credit for the first ten people who use your referral code.
After that you may still refer your friends and family, but you will not be eligible to receive additional shop credit.
You can opt-in to our mailing list or join our loyalty program by providing Food52 with the first and last names or email addresses for your friends in connection with our “Refer a Friend” program.
If you do so, you may be eligible for certain benefits associated with our Platform that may change from time to time.
==========
By providing us with first and last names or email addresses in connection with our “Refer a Friend” program, you thereby represent and warrant to us that you have the right to provide us with this information for use and disclosure as described in this Privacy Policy under all applicable laws.
We will use this information for the sole purpose of sending direct marketing emails to your friend, inviting him or her to use our Platform.
Our direct marketing emails always include an opportunity to unsubscribe from further emails.
If your friend chooses to become a Registered User, he or she will be required to accept our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy as part of the registration process.
We generally do not treat consumers differently if they exercise a right under California law.
For example, if you opt-out of our mailing list, you can continue to receive most discounted prices by emailing us at [email protected].
However, in certain circumstances, discounted prices will require you to be on our mailing list or a member of our loyalty program.

§
Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe.
==========
Roles.
Data protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”).
Food52 acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our websites, emails, and advertisements.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
Data protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data.
Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers, partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.
==========
Data Transfer and Privacy Shield.
If your data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate safeguards, such as the Privacy Shield Framework discussed below and/or Standard Contractual Clauses.
Food52 complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union member countries (including Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, respectively.
We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability (the “Privacy Shield Principles”).
In accordance with our obligations under Privacy Shield, and subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission, we hereby affirm our commitment to be subject to the Privacy Shield Principals for all personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland in reliance on Privacy Shield.
This means that, in addition to our other obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, we shall be liable to you for any third party agent to which we transfer your personal data and that processes such personal data in a manner that violates the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the resulting damages.
If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
==========
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.
EU and/or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us at [email protected].
We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints from EU and/or Swiss individuals under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by us, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint.
If these processes do not result in a resolution, you may also contact your local data protection authority, the US Department of Commerce, and/or the Federal Trade Commission for assistance.
Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.
==========
Your Data Subject Rights
If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you.
You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you.
In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
==========
Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.
You may exercise your rights by sending an email to [email protected], and we will respond to your request within 30 days.
We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request.
Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your requests.
If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
==========
Retention of Personal Data
We will retain your personal data in a form that identifies you to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
We may continue to retain and use information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, such as journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research, statistical analysis, compliance with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, preventing fraud, and enforcing our agreements.
Complaints.
If you have a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.
We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us.
To do so, please use the contact information located in the Contact Us section above.
