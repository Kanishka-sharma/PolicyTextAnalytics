What type of information does Kmart collect from children?
Some Kmart websites may collect online contact information from children under the age of 13 in order to respond once to a specific request from a child.
For example, some Kmart websites may allow children to submit questions and get a response from a Kmart expert.
Online contact information that is collected in this manner will be deleted after a response is made to the child.
==========
Some Kmart websites may collect online contact information from children under the age of 13 in order to respond more than once to a specific request from a child or to protect the safety of the child.
For example, some Kmart websites may collect online contact information to allow a child to sign up for an online newsletter.
Each Kmart website that collects such online contact information requires the child to provide either a parent's or guardian's e-mail address or a parent's or guardian's street address so that Kmart can send the child's parent or guardian a notice regarding Kmart children's online information practices.
In such situations, the contact information is only used to respond to the child's request and to notify the child's parent or guardian that the child contacted Kmart.
Kmart will not condition a child's participation in an activity on the provision of more information than is reasonably necessary for the activity.

How does Kmart obtain verifiable parental consent from parents or guardians?
Some Kmart websites may collect online contact information from children under the age of 13 for participation in promotions or ongoing programs.
Each Kmart website that collects such information uses reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting such information from a child.
Parents or guardians are required to demonstrate their consent for their child's participation in the promotion or program by submitting a signed consent form to Kmart, by calling an 800-number, by submitting a credit card number, or by submitting an e-mail message.
The method of parental consent will vary, depending upon the specific promotion or program.
Additional consent mechanisms may be used in the future.
==========
Whenever parental consent is obtained, the parent or guardian will be asked to choose or be given an identification code so that Kmart can identify and authenticate future requests from that parent or guardian.

How may I review the information that my child provided to Kmart?
Parents or guardians whose children have provided information to Kmart may review the information provided by their child by sending an e-mail message to help@Kmart.com or to the e-mail address listed on the Kmart.com site that collected their child's information.
For verification and security purposes, Kmart may request that such parental requests must contain the parent's or guardian's name and identification code as well as a valid e-mail address, a street address, or a phone number.
==========
Parents or guardians may also request that Kmart delete their child's information.
If such a parental request is received, Kmart will make all reasonable efforts to delete the information from its files.
