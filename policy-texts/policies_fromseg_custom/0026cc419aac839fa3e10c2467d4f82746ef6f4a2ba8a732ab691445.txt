What This Privacy Pledge Covers
This privacy pledge covers how Lulu treats personal information that Lulu collects and receives, including information related to your use of Lulu services.
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lulu does not own or control, or to people that Lulu does not employ or manage.
Information Collection and Use
General
Lulu may collect personal information when you register, when you use Lulu services, when you visit Lulu pages or the pages related to the content contained within Lulu.
Lulu may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
==========
When you register we ask for information such as your first and last name and email address.
If you register as a creator, we may request information about your address, occupation, industry, and information required to pay royalties.
Once you register with Lulu and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
Lulu collects information about your transactions with us and your use of the services that we offer.
==========
Lulu automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser settings, and pages requested.
Lulu also requires a cookie, used only to keep track of your login status.
Lulu uses information for the following general purposes:
To fulfill your requests for products and services;
To improve our services;
To contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
==========
To provide publisher correspondence via the Lulu Thank You Note program (included in our upcoming 9.2 release).
As part of this program, Lulu may send e-mails containing a message from the publisher to the content purchaser.
None of the purchaser's personal information is disclosed to the publisher through this program.
We simply forward the publisher's Thank You Note and contact information to the purchaser on their behalf.
Purchasers may opt out of receiving correspondence from this program at any time.
==========
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Lulu does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Lulu under confidentiality agreements.
These companies may use your personal information to help Lulu communicate with you.
However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information, nor do they have any right to contact you for matters not pertaining to Lulu.
Lulu does not share your information with third parties.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Lulu' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Lulu is acquired by or merged with another company.
In this event, Lulu will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy pledge.
If, as a registered creator, you enable your Thank You Note buyer notification option (included in our upcoming 9.2 release), you agree to permit Lulu to display the publisher name and e-mail address you provide on all Thank You Note correspondence to purchasers of your content.

You may delete your Lulu account by contacting support.
If you have published material to Lulu as a creator, that material may remain in some form on the site even after you retire it from public view, particularly if you have granted permission for it to be used as part of a collaborative project that exists elsewhere on the site.
Confidentiality and Security
We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.
