Eastman Kodak Company
Privacy Statement
At Kodak, we intend to give you a high level of control over any information that you provide to us.
In general, you can visit this site (www.kodak.com) without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.
There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address.
It is our intent to let you know before we collect any information from you online.
If you choose to give us information online that we may need — to correspond with you, to process an order or to provide you with software, for example — you can be assured that Kodak will let you know how we will use such information.
If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information distributed to others, or if you tell us that you do not wish to receive additional information from us, we will make every reasonable effort to honor your wishes.
Kodak is actively working with industry organizations to develop effective privacy policies for online marketing.
