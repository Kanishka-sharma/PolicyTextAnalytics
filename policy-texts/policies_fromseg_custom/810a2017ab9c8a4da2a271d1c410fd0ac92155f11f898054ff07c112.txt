Use of "cookies" at the SAE website
When you order products on the SAE website or log into specific areas of the site such as the online forums and member benefits area, our server puts a "cookie" on your computer.
In addition, the SAE website carries banner advertisements from third-party ad servers that may or may not use cookies.
==========
A cookie is a short line of code that takes up a miniscule amount of room on your hard drive.
Many websites use cookies to process online orders and maintain customer records.
SAE uses cookies to keep track of the products you are ordering on our site: the product code, description, price, and quantity.
We need these pieces of information to process your order online.
==========
They also help the server identify who you are and your role with SAE to provide you with appropriate access to various areas of the site (online forums, member benefits, etc.) SAE does not sell or make available to other organizations any of the information in the cookies that its server sets on your harddrive.
Cookies that are set by SAE servers to process your online product order expire automatically from your computer 30 days after being put there.
==========
This allows you to visit our site, add products to your shopping cart, and come back up to a month later and resume shopping without losing what's in your cart.
Of course, you can always empty your cart yourself.
==========
Cookies that are used as part of the site login process when you visit various areas of the site (forums, member benefits, etc.) expire when you close your browser.
You can disable the cookies function on your browser or erase the contents in your cookies file.
To do this, consult the help features in your program manager and browser.
The downside is that you won't be able to take advantage of our nifty online ordering system, participate in our onoline forums or access information you may otherwise be able to access (member benefits, for example).
