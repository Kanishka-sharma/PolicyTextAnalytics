Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers stored on to your browser when you access certain websites, including Oath Services.
Cookies allow a website to recognise a user's preferences as previously chosen by the user when they return to a site.
A cookie itself does not contain or collect information.
However, when it is read by a server in conjunction with a web browser it can help a website deliver a more user-friendly service for example, remembering previous purchases or account details.
Cookies are filed in the memory of your browser and each one typically contains:

The name of the server the cookie was sent from
The lifetime of the cookie
A value – usually a randomly generated unique number

The website server which sends the cookie uses this number to recognise you when you return to a site or browse from page to page.
Only the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie.
Cookies are central to the customisation of the internet and online behavioural advertising usually works using cookies.
There are two types of cookies: session and persistent.
Session cookies exist only during a user's online session and they disappear from the user's browser when the user closes his/her browser.
Persistent cookies stay on your browser after the browser has been closed.
==========
The cookies used on the Oath Services do not identify you personally.
They merely recognise your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily.
You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password (for example, when you register for an AOL user name), by responding to a promotional offer or by personalising a webpage.
Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit that Web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page.
Many websites may also use Flash cookies that operate similarly to browser cookies.
We use browser cookies to help recognize you as an Oath Services user.
We may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies in combination with your Oath information to enhance and personalise your experience on Oath Services, including:

to help authenticate you when you use Oath Services;
to remember your preferences and registration information;
to enable a shopping cart;
to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of Oath Services offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which Oath e-mails you open and act upon);
and to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through the Oath Services.
