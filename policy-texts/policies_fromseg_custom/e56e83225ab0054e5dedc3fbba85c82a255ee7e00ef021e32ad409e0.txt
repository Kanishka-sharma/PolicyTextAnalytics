 Why and how do we collect your personal data ?
3.1.
==========
What is a DSP (“ demand-side platform”) ?
A “demand-side platform” (or DSP platform), a category to which the Hawk platform, from TabMo is attached, is a service provider that offers its buyers (media agencies or advertisers), targeted advertising services.
For this, the DSP buys advertising space to editors (smartphone application, websites, etc.), that it sells then selectively to clients, in addressing them their most likely target audiences.
This method involves the identification of targeted audiences among the users of said sites or mobile applications, and therefore, the processing of several categories of personal data of these same users.
Thus TabMo is likely to identify some of your habits, characteristics, distinguishing features, deducted from your terminal activity (smartphone, tablet, computer).
3.2.
==========
What is personal data ?
Personal data means any information relating to a natural person from which said person can be identified either directly or indirectly .
The directly identifying data are, for instance, your first and last names.
Less identifying data can nevertheless be qualified as personal data, insofar as it provides information about you, in particular, when it is crossed with identifying data.
This is the case, for instance, with your geolocation history.
3.3.
==========
How do we collect your personal data ?
When you visit the website or mobile application of an editor, and when consent to it, TabMo may collect certain types of data personal about you, they deduced from the use of your terminal.
These personal data do not allow us to identify you directly .
