Protecting customers' privacy is important to Merrick Bank.
In order to help
            you understand what information we collect and how we use it, we have
            implemented this privacy policy.
What Information We Collect 
            We may collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from the following
            sources:


Information we receive from you, including information you provide on
               applications or other loan or account forms;
               Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others; and
               Information we receive from third parties, such as our affiliates or credit
                  bureaus.
"Nonpublic personal information" is information about you that we obtain in
            connection with providing a financial product or service to you.
For example,
            nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account
            balance and payment history.

            We may disclose all of the information that we collect about you and our former
            customers, as described above.
We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you and our former
            customers to the following types of "affiliates" (i.e., companies related to us
            by common control or ownership) and "nonaffiliated third parties" (i.e., third
            parties that are not members of our corporate family):

            Financial service providers such as VISA USA, Inc., MasterCard

If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you
            (and your authorized user or co-account holder, if applicable) or with respect
            to your account to such nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those
            disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other
            than disclosures permitted by law).
If you wish to opt out of disclosures to
            nonaffiliated third parties, you may do so by completing the online

            perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions

            information about your account (such as information we receive from you in
