At Marzen Media LLC d/b/a FantasyPros.com (“FantasyPros”, “we”, “us”), we are committed to you and to protecting your privacy rights.
We only collect and track the minimum information necessary to provide you with an enhanced user experience while visiting our website, FantasyPros.com (referred to as the “Website”), and using our associated mobile apps.
Our website and mobile apps are collectively referred to as the “Service”.
What information do we collect?
==========
Personal Information
FantasyPros offers a variety of free content and tools that do not require any sort of user registration, therefore no information is gathered from you.
However, in order to enhance your experience on our site, subscribe for premium membership, and access certain areas of our site, FantasyPros may require you to register for an account.
When you register for a FantasyPros account, you are asked to provide your name and email address in order for us to contact you and allow for account recovery in the event that you forget your password.
If you choose to register or connect using your Facebook account, you grant us access to your Facebook account’s associated name and email address only.
We do not store any other personal information from your Facebook account.
Types of Personal Data We Collect
FantasyPros collects Personal Data about you when you provide it directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners (e.g. companies with whom we integrate our Service), service providers (such as our advertising service providers) provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Service.
We collect the following Personal Data from you in connection with the Service:
Contact Information: information we collect to identify or contact you such as your first and last name and email address.
==========
For example, this is the basic information that we collect when you register for an account on our site.
Transaction Information: information related to transactions you conduct on the Service, including when you subscribe or sign up for a special offer, and your interactions with the Service (for example the functionality you use and the links clicked on the Service).
This information does not include financial information.
==========
User Account Information: information that identifies you to the Service, such as your user name, email address, password, and IP address.
For example, we use this information to authenticate you when you log in to the Service, and use the IP address to help maintain your web session security and account preferences while using the Service.
Device information: information about devices accessing the Service, including type of device, what operating system and version is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data.
User Content: to the extent that you choose to input Personal Data as part of the content, images, comments, and other information, and materials that you choose to post to or through the Service.
==========
League Information: many benefits offered on FantasyPros.com relies on customization of tools and information based on your fantasy sports league(s) and respective team(s).
In order to improve relevance of the tools and information you see, we ask you to provide us with access to import those leagues, typically by logging in to your league host or explicitly granting permission for our tools to access your data.
We do not store your login information on our servers, as we either get permission from you to access the league via an API or rely on the cookies of your league host to grant access.
==========
We request but do NOT store the following Personal Data from you when using our Service:
Financial Account Information: information that you provide in connection with your purchase of the Service (or a purchase made through the Service), including credit card number, credit card expiration date, and credit card verification code.

How we protect your information.
We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal information on our systems.
Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems.
==========
To ensure compliance with the latest security technology, we recommend using one of the following browsers and keeping them updated with the latest version.
Each of these browsers can be downloaded free of charge:
Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/
Mozilla Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
To ensure the highest level of security available today, we encrypt all Website communications with a secure 256-bit certificate.
If you do not have access to a browser that supports this encryption, your information may not be processed properly by our servers and may adversely affect your experience while using our Website or Service.
Alternately, it may not be securely transferred through your web browser to our servers.
When you submit information over the Internet to any website or entity, the information passes through multiple networks and systems.
Unfortunately, not all of these systems are under our control, and information may be intercepted.
While we do our best to protect your information, FantasyPros cannot ensure or warrant the security of your information that you transmit to us due to those circumstances.
You use our Website and Service at your own risk.
Additionally, by voluntarily posting anything in a public area of the Internet, including our Website or Service, you are making that information publicly available to others.
==========
You should always exercise caution when publicly disclosing any personal information.
Your personally identifiable information is stored in our secure database.
E-mail addresses are securely stored with our e-mail management partner, MailChimp.
Your password is encrypted using a 256-bit hashing algorithm.
==========

California-specific privacy rights
If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).
Categories of personal information we collect
Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about users.
Under the CCPA, we are also required to provide you with the “categories” of personal information we collect.
The categories we may collect are: identifiers (such as name and email address); commercial information (such as subscription data or league information); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or Services usage); geolocation information (e.g., your city and state based on IP address); inference data about you; and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.
How we use and disclose these categories of personal information
We use and disclose the categories of personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various business purposes we discuss throughout this Policy, and how you engage with the Service.
==========
Please see the relevant section(s) above for more information.
If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information.
Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request:
Information about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information.
==========
Such information is also set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.
Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
==========
The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.
We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law.
Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information or to comply with a legal obligation.
We will let you know where this is the case or if certain rights don’t apply in your country or state of residence.
==========
We also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which might include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address.
You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf.
In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such request or a power of attorney.
We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.
==========
Additionally, exercising your deletion right may mean that you may no longer be able to use the Service.
If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us via our web form here.
Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information
California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.
California law broadly defines “sale” in a way that includes when we share your information with third parties, such as sports leagues or teams, to provide you with offers and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.
==========
It also may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies IP address and/ or browsing behavior, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services.
Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.
Depending on what Services you use, we may provide the following categories of information to third parties for these purposes:
For online targeted advertising purposes: demographic and statistical information, user-generated content, device information and identifiers, connection and usage data, geolocation, and social media information.
For sharing with third parties to send you relevant offers and promotions: contact and account registration information; demographic and statistical information, user-generated content, and geolocation.
==========
If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined via our web form.
You can also submit a sale opt-out request by contacting our customer support team.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.
==========
