FUSIO PLATFORM: DATA PROCESSING
1.1 Purpose of data processing
The data is processed to allow our Customers to buy and release behavioral advertising and measure its performance through our Platform.
Behavioral advertising means information collected across multiple web sites, in app, that you visit in order to predict your preferences and to show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you
On request of our Customers, S4M can also perform cross-device attribution.
It is the measurement and reporting of conversions of ads as they take place after multiple engagements across different devices.
For example, a User may click on an ad on one device, but will finish the desired action on another device.
==========
Processing data also allow us to improve the technical functionality of our Platform, as well as our products and services.
1.2 Type of data processed
General.
S4M only processes data that are relevant for the performance of its Platform’s services, whether by nature or volume.
By delivering an ad to you via the Platform, S4M collects data about your mobile device (such as smartphone, tablet etc) using specific technology, as explained below.
==========
The Internet.
S4M services are provided thanks to the Internet.
Hence, the use of S4M services includes the processing of data found in every communication sent over the Internet, such as: browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); User-agent string (e.g operating system; operating system version); browser language (e.g., English or French); referrer addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) address.
==========
A browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.
Platform customers’ data.
When the Customer or Partner register to the Platform we ask for basic registration information, such as name, company, position, address, email address, phone, and other contact information.
We may ask for voluntary personal information at other times, including but not limited to when Customer or Partner report a problem with the Platform.
This type of information is deemed personal data and is used to contact Customer or Partner or determine its specific identity.
When other information is linked to this information, it also becomes personal data.
We may also automatically receive and record information in our server logs from Customer or Partner’s browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); User-agent string; browser language (e.g., English or French); device timestamp and time zone; Device screen size; Internet Protocol (IP) address, and other generally-accepted log information.
We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information.
==========
Customer or Partner can access or correct certain personal information, such as applicable passwords, directly in the Account sections of the Platform.
If Customer or Partner have provided personal data, such as his/her e-mail address when registering for our Platform, Customer or Partner may modify that information at any time by visiting your Account settings.
Notably, since we may use its User name as the account identifier, Customer or Partner may not be able to change its User name.
In addition, Customer or Partner can delete its account at any time.
In a such case, S4M acts as Controller (having the meaning set forth under article 4 of GDPR) and its legal basis is the conclusion of the contract with its Customer and/or Partner
Users data processed through the platform, including geolocation data.
==========
When an User views an ad on a site or app which uses our services, we collect information about the ad that he/she has viewed (e.g. advertiser’s name, type of advert, etc) and the web site or the app where the ad was delivered.
This information does not enable us to work out any Users identity in real life but does enable us to recognize from which advertisements Users are coming from thanks to the following main data collected: device timestamp and time zone, device type, network provider, Mobile advertising ID, IP address, the geolocation of used device such as Lat/long, user-agent string, operating system, operating system version, and screen size.
Depending on domestic regulation, these data may be considered as personal data, for example, like under the GDPR.
==========
We may specifically collect the information about the ad Users have viewed or clicked on.
We collect some or all of the following information about the ad Users have viewed, clicked on: (i) the content type of the ad (what the ad is about, e.g. games, finance, entertainment, news); (ii) the ad type (e.g. whether the ad is a text, image, rich media or video based ad); (iii) where the ad is being served (e.g. the address of the website on which the ad appears); and (iv) certain information about post-click activity in relation to the ad (e.g. whether you proceed to fill-in form, purchase the product or service advertised).
We may also collect information of the specific places (mostly area) that Users have visited during the period of the advertising campaign to measure the performance of the ads.
In some cases, we can collect, on behalf of our Customers your name, email address and other direct personal data when you fill out a questionnaire with such information.
IIn a such case, Customers, for whom the ad campaign is released by S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor (having the meaning set forth under article 4 of GDPR).
Cross Device Tracking.
To measure and report conversions of ads as they take place after multiple engagements across different devices, our third-party service providers, may set and/or access cookies or other data collection technology which collect information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, mobile websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of interest to you across those various devices.
Our Partners are using a probabilistic model by matching anonymous signals to try and identify a User.
These signals include:
Location (IP addresses)
Date
Conversion Type
Device IDs
Landing Page
Interests and web history
In a such case, Advertisers, for whom the ad campaign is released by S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor (having the meaning set forth under article 4 of GDPR).

The cookies contain a unique tracking ID per Ad placement and a session ID, and a User ID and will expire after 20 minutes.

1.3 Role of S4M as a Controller or Processor
If you are located in one of the countries of the European Economic Area, S4M may act a “controller” as defined under applicable law when processing your personal data.
S4M may also act as a “processor” as defined under applicable law to the extent that it processes your personal data on behalf of and at the instruction of another party, for example one of our Customers.
We are a data controller when we receive personal information:
from our measurement pixels on an advertiser website.
This is because we use this data for product improvement.
In this instance, we are an independent data controller with the advertiser
from the bid requests coming from a publisher website.
This is because we use this data for fraud detection and product improvement.
In this instance, we are an independent data controller with the publisher
We are a data processor for any other processing activities as we will follow our Customers instructions.
==========
Please note that if you wish to exercise any of your rights with any of our Customers, you must make your request directly to those Customers, based on information and procedures that they supply.
S4M Customers own the Platform data that they maintain in the Platform.
S4M does not control how those Customers use Platform data.
When acting as a data controller, S4M always relies on your consent to process personal information.
We also rely on our legitimate interest when we process aggregated data to improve our products
1.4 How data is collected
In order to serve our Customers, S4M collects data from the publishers through the RTB protocol (Bidstream) in order to display the ads.
==========
TheBidstream allows processing data that are directly related to the advertising campaign.
For example, S4M does not collect geolocation data on a permanent basis.
S4M processes data that are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of behavioural advertising which is why they are processed.
S4M is not an audience provider, instead S4M relies on Bidstream information and, upon Customer’s request, external data provider who are either already working with our Customers or one of our qualified Vendors.
Finally, for ads performance measurement and tracking, upon Customer’s request, S4M can use:
its own Javascript library to collect in-ad activities and advertiser’s website conversions
3rd party data from our qualified Vendors
In addition, for the post-click tracking (examples for landing or application installation), S4M requests to the Advertiser to implement the S4M Tracking Library only after the User consent obtention.
1.5 How data is shared and processed
S4M is a member of IAB Consent and Transparency framework and bases the consent obtention and verification on the IAB consent signal provided via the Bidstream by publishers selling their inventory.
This new organization allows us to check our Partners’ position and track the consent chain as well.
Data is shared with and processed by authorized person such as:
Platform Customers, who are Advertisers and their media agency, that use the platform to deliver advertisements for their own purpose (or on behalf of the advertiser);
S4M qualified Partners, who are companies contributing to improve the service (e.g. audience measurement, viewability measurement, fraud detection);
S4M authorized employees, who are the people who operate the Platform or process information disclosed from S4M Corporate Website and Social Network
These authorized persons are bound to S4M by a contract where the respect of data protection and confidentiality is a key engagement.
Our Partners are asked to provide detailed information on their Privacy and Security measures.
The list of our partners can be found here.

Mobile advertising IDs are unique identifiers that are associated with individual mobile devices.
They usually are user-resettable and are separate from hardware serial numbers.
They are not permanently tied to a mobile device, as Users can reset their Mobile advertising ID at any time for added security or opt out of ad tracking.
As a result, the Mobile advertising ID can no longer be easily linked to specific devices/users
Types of mobile advertising IDs:
Android ID is named GAID
Apple ID is named IDFA or IFA is an Apple Device ID released with iOS 6 and is a cross application / publisher identifier.
If you want to renew your profile used for behavioral advertising services, You can reset by yourself Your Mobile Advertising ID by following the processes described below:
IOs: go to “Settings” then “Privacy”, then “Advertising” and then “Reset Advertising ID” (see demo on Apple Support)
Android : go to “Settings” then “Google” then in “Ads” then “Reset Advertising ID” (see demo on Google Support)
Be aware.
Free media content is financed by advertising release.
