Collection of your Personal Information
We value your trust.
In order to honor that trust, Pluralsight adheres to ethical standards in gathering, using, and safeguarding
            any information you provide.
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you.
For example, when you register for an event, we will need your contact information as well as financial information such
            as a credit card number for billing.
We will retain your contact information in a user profile.
==========
As is true of most websites, we gather site-visitation data automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes
            internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,
            date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information
            without first asking your permission.
Use of your Personal Information
We use our log files which do not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements
            around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
==========
We will merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information
            in aggregate to provide more relevant content.
In some limited-entry sections of pluralsight.com, with your approval, we
            will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content.
If you
            decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information with site-visitation
            data.
==========
We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.
These companies do not retain, share,
            store or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
            is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on
            our website.
Control of your Personal Information
When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, pluralsight.com will not share that information with third
            parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed.
It will only be used for the purposes
            stated in this privacy policy.
==========
The vast majority of our communication with you will occur through our weblog syndication (RSS feeds).
This is naturally
            an optional service to which you can subscribe using a news aggregator of your choice.
Pluralsight will occasionally email notices such as date changes for events for which you have enrolled.
You will not be
            able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.
==========
Access to your Personal Information
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current.
If you have filled out
            a user profile, we will provide an obvious way for you to access and change your profile from our website.
We will even
            allow you to completely delete your profile, although this option will not be available if you are registered for pending
            events or services.
==========
Security of your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number
            and/or social security number) on our registration forms, your information is sent over an authenticated and encrypted connection
            using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
We store your personal information only on servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities, and use
            a variety of technologies and procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
