AIM Home > Terms of Service
Thank you for your interest in AOL® Instant Messenger™ ("AIM").
If you have registered with the AOL Network, please review the AOL Network's Registered User Terms of Service, which govern your registration and use of AIM and other services on the AOL Network.
If you have not registered with the AOL Network, the following terms and conditions govern your registration and use of AIM.
By using or registering for an AIM Product (defined below), you agree to these terms and conditions ("Terms of Service") and the AIM Privacy Policy.
==========
You agree to accept notices electronically.
Each time you use an AIM Product, you reaffirm your acceptance of the then-current Terms of Service.
If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms of Service, you may discontinue using the AIM Products.
==========
You cannot use or sign up for AIM Products until you have accepted these Terms of Service.
If you were an existing AIM user who registered with the Netscape Network, these Terms of Service supersede the Netscape Network's terms regarding your ongoing use of AIM.
Additionally, if you are a user of Enterprise AIM products or co-branded AIM Products, additional terms and privacy conditions may apply to your use of AIM.
==========
For purposes of these Terms of Service, the term "AIM Products" shall mean AIM software (whether preinstalled, on a medium or offered by download), AIM services, AIM websites (including, without limitation, AIM.COM and AIMTODAY.COM) and all other software, features, tools, web sites and services provided by or through AIM from AOL LLC and its business divisions (e.g., Netscape) (collectively "AOL") and AOL's third-party vendors.
You agree and understand that certain AIM Products, features and other premium services offered by or through AIM (including services from AOL) may be subject to additional terms and conditions or registration requirements.
You agree to abide by these additional terms and you further agree that a violation of those terms while you are accessing those products with your AIM Screen Name or through an AIM Product shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Service.
==========
AOL may change the Terms of Service at any time and in its sole discretion.
The modified Terms of Service will be effective immediately upon posting and you agree to the new posted Terms of Service by continuing your use of the AIM Products.
AOL will provide at least 30-days' notice before any material changes take effect.
If you do not agree with the modified Terms of Service, your only remedy is to discontinue using the AIM Products and cancel your registration.
The AIM Products are intended for general audiences.
You represent and warrant that you have adequate legal capacity to enter into binding agreements such as these Terms of Service.
==========
Some AIM Products may require the user to register and provide information to AOL, such as name, e-mail address, gender, date of birth, zip code (the "Registration Information").
If you register for any AIM Product, you agree to provide accurate and complete Registration Information and you agree to keep such information current.
You will need a valid form of identification to use AIM Products, such as a valid screen name issued by AOL or such other forms of user identification authorized by AOL (collectively, "Screen Name").
==========
You may use the Screen Name already assigned to you from AOL-authorized services, such as, AOL, CompuServe or Netscape.
If you do not have a Screen Name, you can register for a screen name on the AIM service.
You may not (1) select or use a Screen Name of another person with the intention of impersonating that person, (2) use a Screen Name of anyone else without authorization, (3) use a Screen Name in violation of the intellectual property rights of any person or (4) use a Screen Name that AOL considers in its sole discretion as being inappropriate.
==========
Unless you are a subscriber to an AOL® fee-based subscription service (including, CompuServe®, AOL® or Netscape®), you must use your Screen Names on a regular basis (e.g., log into an AIM Product) to keep your Screen Names and registration active.
AOL may cancel the registration and Screen Names and delete any e-mail or data any AIM Product of any registered user who does not have a current subscription or who AOL has determined in its sole discretion has not used such Screen Name for a period of ninety (90) days.
If your Screen Name is canceled, you will need to re-register for an AIM Product and obtain a new Screen Name to gain access to registration-based features and tools.
If the Screen Name that you previously used and which was canceled has not been taken by another registered user of AIM or any affiliated service including, without limitation, AOL, CompuServe or Netscape, you may re-register with your canceled Screen Name.
==========
You agree that AOL may deactivate any free e-mail accounts offered by AIM that you do not use or visit for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days.
You agree that AIM has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any e-mail messages on such deactivated e-mail accounts.
If your e-mail account is deactivated, you will need to reactivate an e-mail box or sign up a new account.
==========
The AIM Privacy Policy explains how AOL collects and uses information and the choices you have with that information.
You consent to AOL using your registration information and other information collected by AOL under the terms of the AIM Privacy Policy.
By registering with or using AIM Products, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information and the transfer of this information to the United States or other countries for the processing and storage by AOL.
Additionally, you agree that AOL may use the Screen Names and wallet services, or other similar technologies, to authenticate you on AIM, help store your registration and transaction-related information, and enable you to take advantage of offerings from AOL and its affiliated providers.
You are responsible for all activity made by you or anyone you allow to use your AIM account and Screen Name, including your family or friends.
You agree to keep confidential the passwords associated with your account.
You may not use AIM while driving, operating hazardous equipment, or engaging in other forms of hazardous activities.
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AOL for losses incurred by AOL or another party due to someone else using your account or password as a result of your failure to use reasonable care to keep your account information confidential or as a result of your failure to use reasonable care while using AIM Products.
==========
You are responsible for any materials you post or make available on or through the AIM Products, including message board posts, chat participation and homepages.
You are responsible for obtaining your own Internet access, such as maintaining all telephone, computer hardware and other equipment needed for access to and use of the AIM Products, and all charges related thereto.
Any telephone or other communications charges incurred by you to access AIM are your responsibility.
If you are accessing AIM through a telephone line, please call your local phone company to determine if the access numbers you select are subject to long distance or other toll charges at your location.
Also, your carrier, such as a wireless carrier, may charge service fees for alerts, text messaging (including receiving/sending instant messages and e-mail), web browsing and other services that require the use of airtime and wireless data services.
Check with your carrier to verify the fees that may apply to you.
==========
You may use AIM Products for lawful purposes only.
You may not post on or transmit through community areas (e.g., message boards, chat, e-mail, calendars, instant messaging products) or other means any material that (1) violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others, (2) is unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane, indecent or otherwise objectionable, (3) encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, (4) gives rise to civil liability, (5) violates any policies posted in any community areas or (6) otherwise violates any law.
You also may not undertake any conduct that, in AOL's judgment, restricts or inhibits any other user from using or enjoying the AIM Products, including without limitation the community areas.
You may not use AIM Products including communication tools such as e-mail, instant messaging and chat services to send unsolicited bulk communications, including through e-mail or instant messages.
Similarly, you may not authorize others to use your account or sub-accounts to send unsolicited bulk communications, or cause unsolicited bulk communications to be sent by someone else.
You may not harvest or collect information about AIM users from AIM Products, including Screen Names, and use that information for the purpose of sending unsolicited bulk communications.
Any violation of these provisions may result in immediate termination of your account and further legal action.
You agree that AOL may take any legal and technical remedies to prevent unsolicited bulk communications from entering, utilizing or remaining within AIM's networks.
==========
AOL, its vendors and AIM users who lawfully post content such as information, software, games, communications, photos, video, graphics, music, sound and other materials ("Content") on AIM Products own the property rights to that Content.
The Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, international treaties, laws and other proprietary rights, and also may have security components that protect digital information only as authorized by AOL or its vendors.
You agree that you will not take any action to interfere with AOL's or its vendors' ownership of or rights in the Content and you will not attempt to circumvent any mechanisms for preventing the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the Content.
==========
You may use Content available on the AIM Products only for personal, non-commercial purposes.
You may be given the opportunity to download certain Content such as music and photos, but you may do so only to the extent as authorized for that particular Content and only for your personal use.
You may not use the Content in a manner that exceeds the rights granted for your use of the Content, which includes unauthorized copying or distribution of the Content or creating an unauthorized derivative work.
As explained in detail in the AIM Privacy Policy, AOL does not read your private online communications when you use any of the communication tools on AIM Products.
If, however, you use these tools to post Content or other information to public areas on AIM Products (for example, in chat rooms or online message boards), other online users will have access to this information and Content.
You may only post Content to public areas on AIM Products that you created or which the owner of the Content has given you permission to post.
You may not post or distribute Content to public areas on AIM Products that is illegal or that violates these Terms of Service.
By posting or submitting Content to public areas of AIM Products, you represent and warrant that (i) you own all the rights to this Content or are authorized to use and distribute this Content to public areas of AIM Products and (ii) this Content does not and will not infringe any copyright or any other third-party right nor violate any applicable law or regulation.
You or the owner of the Content retain ownership of all right, title and interest in Content that you post to public areas of any AIM Product.
However, by submitting or posting Content to public areas of AIM Products (for example, posting a message on a message board or submitting your picture for the "Rate-A-Buddy" feature), you grant AOL, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees the irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to reproduce, display, perform, distribute, adapt and promote this Content in any medium.
==========
Once you submit or post Content to any public area on an AIM Product, AOL does not need to give you any further right to inspect or approve uses of such Content or to compensate you for any such uses.
AOL owns all right, title and interest in any compilation, collective work or other derivative work created by AOL using or incorporating Content posted to public areas of AIM Products.
AOL is not required to pre-screen Content available on the AIM Products, including the content of any messaging that occurs on or through the AIM service, although AOL reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion.
AOL is not liable for Content that is provided by others.
AOL reserves the right to remove Content that, in its sole judgment, does not meet its standards or does not comply with these Terms of Service, but AOL is not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such material.
AOL has the right at any time to change, modify, add to or discontinue or retire any aspect or feature of the AIM Products including, but not limited to, the software, community areas, Content, hours of availability, equipment needed for access or use, the maximum disk space that will be allotted on AOL servers on your behalf either cumulatively or for any particular service or the availability of AIM Products on any particular device or communications service.
AOL has no obligation to provide you with notice of any such changes.
AOL and its vendors grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable limited license to install the software and services distributed by AOL (including all software and services provided by a third-party vendor for AOL) in object code form only on any computer or device from which you wish to access the AIM service and all other AIM Products ("Software") and to use the Software for the sole and exclusive purposes of connecting to and using the AIM Products in accordance with these Terms of Service.
You may not sub-license, or charge others to use or access the Software without first obtaining written permission from AOL.
AOL occasionally will provide automatic upgrades to improve your online experience, such as virus and spam screening technologies, although these upgrades may not be consistent across all platform and devices.
You agree to accept and to take no action to interfere with such automatic upgrades, scanning, and related services.

Finally, you may not authorize or assist any third party to do any of the things described in this paragraph.

AIM may from time to time give you the opportunity to purchase or subscribe to products and premium services on AIM (collectively, "Premium Services").
You agree that your purchase or subscription of any Premium Service will be subject to additional terms and conditions that will supplement this agreement.
You can go to "My Account" on the AIM Product to get information about billing or to determine the status of your bill and the amount of any surcharge.
Any trial promotion (such as free trial time or trial access to a Premium Service) must be used within the specified time of the trial.
You must cancel your account before the end of the trial period to avoid being charged a membership fee.
Please note, however, that even during any free trial or other promotion, you will still be responsible for any purchases and surcharges incurred using your account and that you remain responsible for any telecommunications charges or internet access charges that you may incur while you use a Premium Service.
You must select a payment method to pay for your fees for any Premium Service and for all purchases made from AIM Products.
You must give AOL accurate billing and payment information and keep this information up-to-date through the "My Account" area on AIM Today.
You agree to pay AOL for all charges incurred under your account, including all applicable taxes, fees and surcharges.
You authorize AOL to charge your designated payment method for these charges.
==========
If AOL does not receive payment from your designated payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by AOL or its operators.
Every time you use an AIM Product, you reaffirm that (i) AOL (or its designated vendor acting as AOL's billing agent) is authorized to charge your designated payment method; (ii) AOL may submit charges incurred under your account for payment; and (iii) you will be responsible for such charges, even if your membership is canceled or terminated.
You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes, fees, surcharges and purchases made by you or anyone on your account.
==========

If you do not bring them to AOL's attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.
Fees charged for subscription plans are nonrefundable and due in advance unless provided otherwise in your subscription plan.
Under most monthly plans, your payment method will be charged automatically every month until such time that you cancel your subscription or AOL otherwise terminates your subscription.
Also, under most subscription plans, AOL will automatically renew your subscription and charge your payment method until such time that you cancel your subscription or AOL otherwise terminates your subscription.
==========
AOL, as an online business, transacts with its users electronically.
WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR ANY AIM PRODUCT, YOU CONSENT TO RECEIVE ELECTRONICALLY FROM AOL ANY PRIVACY OR OTHER NOTICES, AGREEMENTS, DISCLOSURES, REPORTS, DOCUMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, OR OTHER RECORDS (COLLECTIVELY, "NOTICES").
You agree that AOL generally can send you electronic Notices in either or both of the following ways: (1) to the e-mail address that you provided to AOL during registration or (2) AOL may post Notices on a welcoming screen or top page of the relevant AIM Product.
You agree that certain premium services may also have their own Notice procedures.
==========
You must check your designated e-mail address regularly for Notices.
You must have a personal computer with a modem connected to a communications source (telephone, wireless or broadband), a Windows-based operating system with an Internet browser or a Macintosh-based operating system with an Internet browser and Internet e-mail software in order to access electronic communications.
You will need a printer attached to your personal computer to print any Notices.
==========
You can retrieve an electronic copy and a printable version of the Terms of Service by clicking on the "Terms of Service" link on the home page of AIM.com or AIMToday.com.
The delivery of any Notice from AOL is effective when sent by AOL, regardless of whether you read the Notice when you receive it or whether you actually receive the delivery.
Your only method of withdrawing consent to receive Notices electronically is to terminate any subscriptions, services or other products provided under these Terms of Service.
A.
The provisions of these Terms of Service addressing disclaimers of representations and warranties, limitation of liability, indemnity obligations, intellectual property, Premium Services and governing law shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service, your Premium Services and your registration with the AIM Products.
B.
==========
These Terms of Service and any operating rules for any areas of functionality of the AIM Products established by AOL constitute the entire agreement between AOL and you regarding the subject matter of these Terms of Service, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements.
In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms of Service and any such other terms of use or operating rules of a specific AIM Product, these Terms of Service will supersede such other terms of service or operating rules.
The Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute under the Terms of Service and or your use of the AIM Products resides in the courts located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you further expressly agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.
The foregoing provision may not apply to you depending on the laws of your jurisdiction.
==========
No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
