VONAGE TERMS OF SERVICE

These Terms of Service constitute the agreement ("Agreement") between Vonage America Inc. ("we," "us" or "Vonage") and the user ("you," "user" or "Customer") of Vonage's communications services and any related products or services ("Service").
This Agreement governs both the Service and any devices, such as an IP phone, Vonage V-Phone™, Multimedia Terminal Adapter, Analog Telephone 
Adapter or any other IP connection device ("Device" or "Equipment"), used in conjunction with the Service and it applies to all lines on each Vonage account.
If you purchased Equipment from a retail store or a provider other than Vonage ("Retail Provider"), you are a "Retail Customer" for purposes of this Agreement.
BY ACTIVATING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND FULLY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1.
==========
EMERGENCY SERVICES - 911 DIALING 
1.1 911 Dialing.
Vonage 911 Dialing is different than traditional 911 service.
Most of our customers (other than customers using WiFi™, Vonage V-Phone, Softphone or another portable Device)

have access to either basic 911 or Enhanced 911 (E911) service.
With E911 service, when you dial 911, your telephone number and registered address 
is simultaneously sent to the local emergency center assigned to your location, and emergency operators have access to the information they need to send help and call you back if necessary.
Customers in locations 
where the emergency center is not equipped to receive, capture or retain

your telephone number and address have basic 911 or limited E911.
With basic 911 or limited E911, the local emergency operator answering the call may not have your call back number or your exact 
location, so you must be prepared to give them this information.
Until you give the operator your phone number, he/she may not be able to call you back or dispatch help if the call is dropped or disconnected, or if you are unable to speak.
==========
As additional local emergency centers become capable of receiving our customers' information, Vonage will automatically upgrade customers with basic 
911 to E911 service.
Vonage will not give you notice of the upgrade.
Certain customers do not have access to either basic 911 or E911.
If you don't have access to basic 911 or E911, your 911 call will be sent to the Vonage national emergency call center.
==========
A trained agent at 
the emergency call center will ask for the name, telephone number and location of the customer calling 911, and then contact the local emergency center for such customer in order to send help.
Examples of situations 
where 911 calls will be sent to the Vonage national emergency call center include when there is a problem validating a customer's address, the customer is identified with an international location, or the 
customer is located in an area that is not covered by the landline 911 network.
In addition, if you use certain portable Devices, your 911 calls will be routed to the Vonage 
national emergency call center.
Emergency personnel do not receive your phone number or physical location when your 911 call is routed to the Vonage national emergency call center.
You authorize us to disclose your name and address to third-parties involved with providing 911 Dialing to you, including, without limitation, call routers, call centers and local emergency centers.
==========
1.2 Notify All Users.
You should inform all household residents, guests and other third persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the Service of the important differences 
in and limitations of Vonage 911 Dialing as compared with basic 911 or E911.
The documentation that accompanies each Device will include a sticker concerning the potential non-availability of 
basic 911 or E911 (the "911 Sticker").
It is your responsibility, in accordance with the instructions that accompany each Device, to place the 911 Sticker on each Device that you use with the Service.
If you did not 
receive a 911 Sticker with your Device, or you require additional 911 Stickers, please contact our customer care department at 1-VONAGE-HELP.
==========
1.3 Registration of Physical Location Required.
For each phone line that you utilize with the Service, you must register with Vonage the physical location where you will be using the Service with that 
phone line.
Your initial location will be registered as a part of subscribing to the Service.
==========
It is incumbent on you to confirm the accuracy of your physical address via your online account if you have any changes, additions or transfers of phone numbers.
When you move the Device to another location, you must update your location.
If you do not update your location, 911 calls you make may be sent to an emergency center near your old address.
You may update a location by logging on to your online account.
For purposes of 911 Dialing, you may only register one location at a time for each phone line.
Regardless of what address you register for a portable device (e.g., WiFi, Vonage V-Phone or SoftPhone), emergency calls you make from these devices will be routed to the Vonage national emergency response center.
==========
1.4	Service Outages.
(a)	Service Outages Due to Power Failure or Disruption.
911 Dialing does not function in the event of a power failure or disruption.
If there is an interruption in the power supply, the Service, 
including 911 Dialing, will not function until power is restored.
Following a power failure or disruption, you may need to reset or reconfigure the Device prior to utilizing the Service, including 911 Dialing.
==========
(b)	Service Outages Due to Internet Outage or Suspension or Disconnection of Broadband Service or Internet Service Provider ("ISP") Service.
Service outages or suspensions or disconnections of service by your broadband provider or 
ISP will prevent all Service, including 911 Dialing, from functioning.
(c)	Service Outage Due to Disconnection of Your Vonage Account.
Service outages due to disconnection of your account will prevent all Service, including 911 Dialing, from functioning.
(d)	Service Outages Due to ISP or Broadband Provider Blocking of Ports or Other Acts.
Your ISP, broadband provider or other third party may intentionally or inadvertently block the ports over 
which the Service is provided or otherwise impede the usage of the Service.
If you suspect this has happened to you, you should alert us to this situation and we will work with you to attempt to resolve the issue.
==========
During the period 
that the ports are being blocked or your Service is impeded, your Service, including 911 
Dialing, may not function.
You acknowledge that Vonage is not responsible for the blocking of ports by any third party or any other impediment to your usage of the Service, and any 
loss of Service, including 911 Dialing, which may result.
In the event you lose service as a result of blocking of ports or any other impediment to your usage of the Service, you will continue to be responsible 
for payment of the Service charges unless and until you disconnect the Service in accordance with this Agreement.
==========
(e)	Other Service Outages.
If there is a Service outage for any reason, such outage will prevent all Service, including 911 Dialing, from functioning.
Such outages may occur for a variety of 
reasons, including, but not limited to, those reasons described elsewhere in this Agreement.
1.5	Network Congestion; Reduced Speed for Routing or Answering 911 Dialing Calls.
There may be a greater possibility of network congestion and/or reduced speed in the routing of a 911 Dialing 
call made utilizing the Service as compared to traditional 911 dialing over traditional public telephone networks.
==========
1.6 Disclaimer of Liability and Indemnification.
We do not have any control over whether, or the manner in which, calls using our 911 Dialing service are answered or addressed by any local emergency 
response center.
We disclaim all responsibility for the conduct of local emergency response centers and the national emergency calling center.
We rely on third parties to assist us in routing 911 Dialing calls 
to local emergency response centers and to a national emergency calling center.
We disclaim any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party data used to route calls is incorrect or yields 
an erroneous result.
==========
Neither Vonage nor its officers or employees may be held liable for any claim, damage, or loss, and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action, arising from or relating to 
our 911 Dialing service unless such claims or causes of action arose from our gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct.
You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Vonage, its officers, directors, 
employees, affiliates and agents and any other service provider who furnishes services to you in connection the Service, from any and all claims, losses, damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including, 
without limitation, attorneys fees) by, or on behalf of, you or any third party relating to the absence, failure or outage of the Service, including 911 Dialing, incorrectly routed 911 Dialing calls, and/or the 
inability of any user of the Service to be able to use 911 Dialing or access emergency service personnel.
1.7 Alternate 911 Arrangements.

services or disconnecting the Service.
