This includes delivering targeted advertising (which means customized advertising according to the
            advertisers’ users’ interests, geographic locations and more) which we infer from information we collect
            their interaction with sites and apps that use our Platform.
We offer solutions across our network of mobile
            publishers and app developers (our “Platform”).

COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
We use cookies to improve the website, monitor and analyze web traffic.
This allows us to better understand
            which sections of our website are more interesting to our visitors.
This also may help us understand certain
            aggregated geographic and demographic information about our visitors.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON OUR PLATFORM
When you view an advertisement using our Platform, we collect some or all of the following information: the
            type of content on the ad (e.g. product or service); the ad type (e.g. text, image, or video); the location of
            the ad being served (e.g. the address of the website on which the ad appears); and information on the post-click
            activity in relation to the ad (e.g. whether you proceed to purchase the product or service advertised).
Our
            partnering mobile publishers or app developers may also disclose to us information they have separately
            collected about you so that we can improve the relevance of the ads we serve on their behalf.
They do this
            in accordance with their own specific privacy policies and subject to their own applicable legal requirements.
We use the information they provide to us only to serve you with interest-based ads on their behalf.
==========
Sensitive
            data, which is Non-PII, such as viewing of sites with sexual content or information indicating a user’s
            specific medical condition, is not used by us to tailor ads from one site to others across our Platform.
Our Platform
            may provide information to publishers and app developers about how you use and engage with their app, as well as
            how sites or apps are performing across different handsets, including but not limited to tracking conversions
            across multiple advertising networks.
We obtain this information as a result of data being sent via our SDK
            embedded by the publisher or developer in the app.
Each publisher and app developer is responsible for obtaining all
            applicable consents to enable VideMob to collect information from your device.
5.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use PII information collected through our Site to operate and improve the Site; respond to your comments
            and questions and provide customer service; monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with
            our Site; prevent fraudulent transactions; provide and deliver your products and services and to send you
            related information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts and
            administrative messages; notify you about updates and news about our products and services; and link or combine with other
            information we get from third parties, to help understand your needs and provide you with better service.
We
            use your usage information to analyze our web traffic, to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site,
            to improve the Site and generally to make it appealing to as many users as possible.
==========
We use the information
            collected through our Platform to display interest-based advertising customised to individuals’ inferred
            interests, preferences and locations, and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and
            technologies.
The information we collect also helps us to provide filtering options for publishers and app developers to
            manage advertisements appearing on their sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for
            advertisers.
For example, this helps our publishers and app developers avoid presenting you with ads that
            you have already seen, as well as show you ads that match your interests.
6.
RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION
We do not retain any of your information on our servers, except for PII that you provide us when you register
            for a Publisher’s account (in order to be able to log in, access reports, etc.).

==========
HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

            with our publisher, app developer and advertiser clients (e.g. provide a report to a client on the number of its
            advertisements that were clicked).
We make the information anonymous and Non-PII prior to sharing it to
            preserve your anonymity.
Our clients use this anonymised information to better understand their site and app traffic
            usage so that they can refine and improve their services, including to limit the number of times a specific
            advertisement is presented to the same mobile device (frequency capping), provide an ad to only certain
            types of mobile devices.

Additionally, there may be times where we will need to disclose information to protect our
            system or our rights or to ensure your safety or the safety of others.

            other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
