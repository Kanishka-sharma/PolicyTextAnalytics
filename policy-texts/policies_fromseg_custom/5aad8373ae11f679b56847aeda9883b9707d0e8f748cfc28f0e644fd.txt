Comcast is a Member of TRUSTe




Comcast Cable Communications, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable

This includes the limitations which Comcast observes in
the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable subscriber information,
the type of personally identifiable information we collect, how we use subscriber
information, under what conditions we may disclose this information, the period

TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with Comcast to resolve your concerns.
Special Note:
The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the Service
by Comcast, and does not cover information that may be collected through software
used in connection with the Service.
==========
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any
other Web sites, products, or services, even if accessed through the Service
and even if co-branded with the Service.
You should read the privacy policies
of the Web sites you visit to learn how they treat your personal information.
Information Collection




The operating company subsidiary of Comcast Corporation that owns and/or operates
  the cable television system in your area pursuant to a cable television franchise
  with the local franchising authority (collectively, “Comcast,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
  is the owner of the information it collects on the Service.
Comcast collects
  information from you at several different points on the Service.
Some of this
  information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not.
Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular
  person.
Comcast uses its cable system to collect personally identifiable information
about our subscribers as necessary in order to render the Service and Service
features, to detect unauthorized reception or use of the Service, and as disclosed
in this Policy.
When you establish an account for the Service we collect information
such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as information
used for credit checks, billing, and payment, and other information we may need
to establish and service an account.
During the initial provisioning of the Service,
and any subsequent changes or updates to that provisioning, Comcast collects
technical information about your computer hardware and software, cable modem
and/or other cable service-related devices, and customization settings and preferences.
==========
Comcast also collects personally identifiable information about you when you
communicate with us for support, maintenance, and billing, send us e-mails, respond
to our surveys or e-mails, register for information, or participate in promotions
or contests, for example.
In addition, Comcast may combine personally identifiable
information, which we collect as part of our regular business records, with personally
identifiable information obtained from third parties for the purpose of creating
an enhanced personal database to use in marketing and other activities.
Information Use and Disclosure




Comcast uses personally identifiable information collected on the Service as
  necessary to render the Service and to:
  
install, operate, support, and maintain the Service;
 confirm that you are receiving the service requested and are
      properly billed for it;
identify you when changes are made to your Service account;
 make you aware of new products or services that may be of interest
      to you;
detect unauthorized reception, use, or abuse of the Service;
determine whether there are violations of any applicable policies and terms of service;
manage the Service network;
configure cable modems and/or other cable service-related devices;
      and
comply with law.
==========
Comcast also uses and discloses personally identifiable information for other
legitimate business activities related to the Service, including, for example:

billing and invoicing;
administration;
surveys;
collection of fees and charges;
marketing;
maintenance;
hardware and software upgrades; and
fraud prevention.
We sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates
or to others with or without your written consent if necessary to render the
Service or to conduct a legitimate business activity related to the Service.
For example, we may disclose your name, address, and other personally identifiable
information to a third party for technical support.
We sometimes also disclose
personally identifiable information about you to our employees, contractors,
and agents for Comcast’s internal business purposes, as well as to outside
auditors, professional advisors and service providers, potential business transition
partners, regulators, and franchise authorities.
Finally, we may disclose your
name and address to our affiliates or to others (for example, on a mailing list),
but you may prohibit or limit this kind of disclosure by following the instructions
in the Choice and Contact Preferences section of this Policy.
In no case, will
the disclosure of your name and address in this manner reveal, directly or indirectly,
the extent of any viewing or other use by you of the Service or the nature of
any transaction made by you over our cable system.
==========
Comcast considers subscribers’ personally identifiable information to be
confidential.
We will only disclose personally identifiable information to third
parties under an obligation of confidentiality and for a limited purpose consistent
with this Policy.
The frequency of any information disclosure varies in accordance
with our business activities and needs.
==========
Legal Disclaimer
Although we make every reasonable effort to preserve your privacy as described
in this Policy, we will disclose personally identifiable information about you
without your consent when required by law in order to comply with a valid legal
process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, for example.
We may
also use or disclose personally identifiable information about you without your
consent to protect our customers, employees, or property, in emergency situations,
to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with you, and for violations
of the Service’s terms of service and policies (including our Acceptable
Use Policy).
Transmission of Information
Comcast transmits personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information
about you over the Service when you send and receive e-mail, transfer and share
files, make files accessible, visit Web sites, or otherwise use the Service.
==========
Our transmission of this information is necessary to render the Service.
Comcast
uses third parties to deliver some features and functions of the Service, such
as support, e-mail, and web hosting, for example, and those third parties collect
or transmit personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information
about you.
These third parties are not permitted to use your personally identifiable
information except for the purpose of providing their services.
We will not read
your outgoing or incoming e-mail, private chat, or instant messages, but we (or
our third party providers) do store e-mail messages on computer systems for a
brief period of time.
We could be required to disclose these messages and communications
along with other personally identifiable information about you to comply with
law or to protect our Service as described in the Legal Disclaimer section of
this Policy.
==========
We also monitor the performance of our Service and your Service
connection in order to manage, maintain, and improve the Service and your connection
to it.
We (or our third party providers) use tools to help prevent and block “spam” e-mails,
viruses, and other harmful or unwanted communications and programs on the Service.
These tools may automatically scan your e-mails, file attachments, and other
files and communications in order to help us protect you and the Service against
these harmful or unwanted communications and programs.
==========
However, these tools do
not collect or disclose personally identifiable information about you.
Service Providers
We contract with third parties to provide specific services and features for
the Service.
For example, our newsgroups are provided by a third party.
==========
When
you use these particular services, generally you provide your name and specific
Service-related information directly to the third party service provider.
If
you become a customer of these third parties directly, then you will be subject
to their terms of service and privacy policies.
You should carefully read their
terms and policies to understand how they may use personally identifiable information
about you.
==========
Aggregate Information
Comcast or our contractors may from time to time share aggregate (non-personally
identifiable) information such as the number of Service subscribers who match
certain statistical profiles (for example, the number of subscribers in various
parts of the country) with our advertisers, content providers, or other third
parties with whom we have a relationship.
We will not provide our advertisers,
content providers, or these other third parties with personally identifiable
information about you unless we have received your consent first.
Likewise, Comcast
will not share personally identifiable information about where you go on the
Service or on the Web unless we have received your consent first.
We also use
aggregate information to better understand how the Service is being used, to
improve it, and for network management, bandwidth usage, maintenance, performance
measurement, and security.
==========
Third Party Advertisers
We use a third-party advertising company, DoubleClick, to serve certain ads when
you visit the Service’s Web site.
This company may use information (not
including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your
visit to the Service Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods
and services that may be of interest to you.
In the course of serving advertisements
to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” through
your browser.
==========
If you would like more information about this practice and to
know your choices about not having this information used by this company, please click here or go to http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.
Business Transitions
In the event Comcast (or its parent company) goes through a business transition,
such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of
its assets, subscribers’ personally identifiable information will, in most
instances, be part of the assets transferred.
If, as a result of the business
transition this Policy will be changed, you should refer to the Notification
of Changes to this Policy section.
Aggregate information may also be transferred
in connection with a business transition.
==========
Support Software and Configuration




Comcast uses information that you provide to Comcast’s support software
to assist you with technical support for the use of the Service.
When you make
use of the Comcast supplied support software and forward a request for assistance
or choose to chat with a technical support representative, the support software
records certain information relating to the request and interaction.
You have
the choice to provide any information to the support software or a support representative,
and you have the ability to confirm your decision before sending any information
to our systems.
The information collected by the support software is limited
to the hardware and software configurations of your computer systems and to any
e-mails you send or discussions you type during a live support session.
==========
This
information is available only to authorized personnel for maintaining and supporting
the use of the Service.
Comcast also provides customer contact and support pages
on the Service that you can use to communicate with Comcast about technical support.
Comcast uses the information provided by you on these pages to support your use
of the Service

In certain cases, at your request or with or without prior notice to you, Comcast
may configure your Service or Service-related equipment to resolve a technical
support issue or otherwise render or deliver the Service.
Preferences




We store information that you provide to personalize your settings on the Service
  so that you don’t have to change these settings each time you use the
  Service.
We do not share your preferences with third parties.
==========
Cookies




Cookies are small files stored on a computer's hard drive to simplify and improve
  a user’s Web experience.
A Web site may store information in a cookie
  about your computer configuration so that it can more efficiently provide information
  to you the next time you visit the site.
Or, your browser program might save
  a cookie with your username and password so that a Web site's server will automatically
  recognize you the next time you access the site.
==========
Comcast uses cookies to remember your username and password, if you choose to store them, from the home page of the Service at www.comcast.net.
Comcast also uses cookies to determine when your current session on the Service's Web site should be logged out after a period of no activity, as well as for efficient management of the servers providing our Web site including when you access the Personal Web Pages and Online Storage services.
Aside from this information, Comcast does not store your name or other personal information in cookies.
Some of our business relationships are with vendors who may use cookies (for example, search engines) or in connection with their own advertisers and other business partners.
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
==========
For more information about how these vendors and their business partners use cookies, and how you may be able to "opt-out" of those cookies, read the privacy policy that applies to each vendor's Web site.
This Policy covers the use of cookies by Comcast on the www.comcast.net Web site only; it does not cover the use of cookies by any other party or Web site unless stated otherwise.
Log Files and Web Site and E-mail Management




Like many Web sites, the Service’s Web site servers use log files.
==========
These logs record aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information about site usage such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service providers, referring/exit pages, pages accessed, platform types, date/time stamps, times of use, and numbers of clicks, for example.
This information is necessary to analyze trends, administer the Service’s Web site, balance web traffic, evaluate users’ electronic browsing in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information except as may be required to comply with law and as described in the Legal Disclaimer section.
==========
We use a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons/Web Bugs) with the log files for the Service’s Web site www.comcast.net.
These clear gifs are usually 1 by 1 pixel invisible images on our Web site’s pages.
When a user visits one of these Web pages, the clear gif contacts our Web servers and creates an entry in the log for the Web site www.comcast.net.
These clear gifs do not use personally identifiable information and they provide us with more accurate Web site visit and session information in the log files.
We also use clear gifs on the Service’s Web site to help format graphic elements.
We (or our third party providers) also use clear gifs in some of the e-mails that we send to you as described in this Policy.
==========
These clear gifs (also known as e-mail sensors) are small invisible images included in HTML-based e-mails.
These clear gifs have two functions.
First, they determine whether an e-mail recipient has opened a particular e-mail.
This helps us improve the wording of subject lines and content as well as determine readership levels.
Second, they determine whether an e-mail recipient is capable of receiving an HTML-based e-mail.
==========
This helps us customize e-mail content and improve your overall customer experience.
Comcast owns the information collected by using e-mail sensors, and our third party providers are obligated to keep this information confidential and not share this information with anyone else or use it for any other purpose.
If you do not want to receive e-mails that use e-mail sensors, you can set up your e-mail program so that it does not accept HTML-based e-mail, and instead uses only plain text format for e-mail.
==========
Finally, some of the content we make available over the Service’s Web site www.comcast.net may use clear gifs to protect against piracy of the content.
These clear gifs (also known as digital water marks) are usually 1 by 1 pixel invisible images that communicate with the content provider’s servers and send a content partner identification number specific to Comcast to the servers.
The content provider’s servers keep track of how many times the digital water mark is requested by each content partner’s Web site and from which uniform resource locator (“URL”) the content is being requested.
The digital water marks do not collect or send personally identifiable information about users of the Service’s Web site.
==========
Communications from Comcast




Special Offers and Updates
We send all new subscribers to the Service a welcome e-mail and sometimes other
information.
Subscribers who would like to receive information from us about
products, services, and special offers, promotions, and features may do so.
See
the Choice and Contact Preferences section of this Policy to learn how to opt
in or opt out of receiving these types of promotional communications.
==========
Service Announcements
We send subscribers Service-related announcements from time to time.
For example,
we may send you an e-mail announcement about a pricing change or a change in
operating policies.
You may not opt-out of these Service-related communications,
though you can deactivate your Service account if you wish.
If you fail to check
your Service account and primary e-mail address for Service-related announcements,
you may miss important information about the Service, including legal notices,
for example.
Customer Service
We communicate with you to provide requested services and support for questions
and issues relating to your Service account.
==========
We will reply to your requests for
customer service by e-mail, phone, discussion forum, or through any other reasonable
means.
Choice and Contact Preferences




We do not send e-mails with special offers, promotions, or features to Service subscribers unless you tell us you want to receive them.
You can request these e-mails by going to the Service Center page on the www.comcast.net Web site and changing your contact preferences on the E-mail Contact Preferences page.
We may ask for additional information on the E-mail Contact Preferences page such as your zip code, for example.
By providing this additional information to us we will be able to better inform you of the availability of special offers, promotions, and features in your area.
Subscribers who no longer wish to receive these e-mails may opt-out of receiving them by going to the same page and changing their contact preferences accordingly.
==========
You may also call 1-800-COMCAST to opt in or opt out of receiving other promotional
information and material from or on behalf of Comcast, and to prohibit or limit
our disclosure of your name and address as discussed in the Information Use and
Disclosure section of this Policy.
In the event Comcast transitions subscribers from another Internet service to
the Service, wherever feasible Comcast will transition subscribers’ existing
preferences and settings to the Service including those pertaining to subscriber
choice.
Once transitioned to the Service, subscribers can follow the instructions
in this Choice and Contact Preferences section of the Policy to change their
preferences and settings.
==========
Links




The Service’s Web site contains links to other sites.
Some of these other
sites may be co-branded with Comcast and may look like Service features, but
Comcast is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites.
We
encourage you to be aware when you leave our Web site and to read the privacy
policies of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information
about you , whether the site is co-branded with Comcast or not.
Security




Comcast takes reasonable security precautions to protect our subscribers’ personally
identifiable information that we collect on the Service from unauthorized access,
use, and disclosure.
For example, we store billing records on computers in a
controlled and secure environment.
However, Comcast cannot guarantee that our
security precautions will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use,
or disclose your personally identifiable information.
==========
Special Note: In no case will Comcast or one of
our authorized service providers ask you for your password in an e-mail or over
the telephone.
Do not give your password to anyone in an e-mail or over the telephone.
Correcting and Accessing Information




If your personally identifiable information changes, if you wish to confirm the
  accuracy of your personally identifiable information, or if you no longer want
  to subscribe to the Service, we provide a way to correct that information and
  a way to deactivate a Service account.
You can correct some personally identifiable
  information at the Member Services page accessible through the Service Center
  link at www.comcast.net.
Or, contact us by telephone at the contact information
  listed below to correct information or deactivate your Service account.
==========
In
  addition, you may examine and copy (at your cost) any personally identifiable
  information we collect and maintain relating to you at your local Comcast office
  upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours.
If you wish to inspect
  those records, please contact us by telephone at 1-800-COMCAST, giving us a
  reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information
  for review, and to arrange an appointment during regular business hours.
We
  will correct our records if you make a reasonable showing that any of the personally
  identifiable information we have collected about you is inaccurate.
You will
  only be permitted to examine records that contain information about you and
  no one else.
==========
Enforcement




You, as a subscriber to the Service, may enforce the limitations imposed on Comcast
  by applicable federal law with respect to the collection and disclosure of
  personally identifiable information about you, through a civil action under
  federal law, in addition to other rights and remedies that may be available
  to you under federal or other applicable laws.
Retention of Information




We will maintain most, if not all, of the personally identifiable information
  we have collected during the time you are a subscriber to the Service.
We generally
  will destroy this personally identifiable information after a reasonable period
  of time has elapsed following the termination of your Service account with
  us, if the purpose for which the information was collected has been accomplished
  and we no longer need to retain the information for legitimate business activities
  or compliance with law.
Notification of Changes to this Policy




If we decide to change this Policy, we will post those changes on the homepage
  of the Service Web site, or in other places we deem appropriate, so our subscribers
  are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances,
  if any, we disclose it.
We will use information in accordance with the Privacy
  Policy under which the information was collected.
Your decision to continue
  receiving the Service after we make any changes to this Policy shall be deemed
  to be your express consent to the changes in the revised Policy.

Special Note about Children



Consistent with the Federal Children's
          Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, Comcast will not knowingly collect
          personally identifiable information from children under the age of
          thirteen without first obtaining parental consent.
Children should
          always get permission from their parents before sending any information
          about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and telephone
        numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.
Revised and effective: August 2003
