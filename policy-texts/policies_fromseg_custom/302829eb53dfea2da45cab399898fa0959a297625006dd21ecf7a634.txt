Oracle Privacy Policy
Oracle Corporation and our subsidiaries and affiliates respect your preferences concerning the collection and use of your personal data.
Our goal is to deliver content targeted to the industry you work in, the products you use, the role you play in your organization, and your specific preferences.
In order to provide you with relevant information, fulfill your specific requests, and enhance your experience across our Web site, we may at times request personal information from you.
The information collected and how it is used will vary across the site.
This policy is our way of letting you know how we collect information, what we collect it for, and what choices you may have.
Your private information will be regarded with the utmost respect.
We are a global corporation, with customers in over 145 countries, and have developed global information practices to assure that your personal data is appropriately protected.
While our main data centers are in the USA, we will transfer information provided by customers to the appropriate Oracle office, distributor, or consultant to provide the necessary service or information requested by the customer.
==========
Oracle also provides links to non-Oracle sites we believe may be of interest to you.
These sites are provided as a convenience and are beyond our control.
You are advised to check the privacy policies of those sites before providing your personal information to them.

Note: www.oracle.com is the main gateway to Oracle Corporation on the Web, containing the general privacy policy for Oracle.com.
Because we have tried to simplify your access to our privacy policy, this policy describes the potential use of visitor information throughout the Oracle.com website.
Parts of the site may make far less use of personal information than we have outlined in the policy, but we wanted to provide you with an inclusive statement of our practices.
Two Oracle websites are excluded from this policy because they are too different in form and function to be accommodated in this policy.
==========
Those sites are:
think.com - a not-for-profit educational project that helps schools provide online learning environments for children;
exchange.oracle.com - An online commercial trading community, which includes hosted portals for other vendors, in which the main intent and benefit of the community is the exchange of information concerning business opportunities.
For your convenience, we have provided links to the think.com and exchange.oracle.com privacy policies.

Types of Data Collection
Oracle collects data from users in four main ways.
Registration screens and online forms
In the process of online purchases (transaction records) and sales inquiries
In e-mails sent to Oracle from users
Through automated means such as communications protocols and cookies
Oracle may receive data from you as part of the communication connection itself - the standard electronic greeting between your computer, the network, and our servers.
This information often consists of network routing (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), date and time.
==========
At this time our server will also query your computer to see if there are "cookies1" set by Oracle.com to facilitate log in or other site navigation procedures.
Some parts of the Oracle site use cookies to collect information about visitors' use of the Web site and to facilitate return visits.
The information collected from cookies is tracked to enhance security and to improve the functionality of the Web site by avoiding duplicate data entry, facilitating navigation, and increasing the relevance of content.
Cookies on the site may collect the following information: a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information used to personalize the content that is shown, and membership information to access Oracle's online communities.
Some cookies used by Oracle.com may remain on the user's computer after they leave the website, but each one is set to expire within 30 days2.
Cookies also serve as a convenience to users by creating a more streamlined login process, keeping track of shopping cart additions and preserving order information between sessions.
==========
In the future, as we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that information provided to you will be the most relevant to your needs.
You can set your Web browser to alert you when a cookie is being used.
You can also get information on the duration of the cookie, and to learn what server your information is being returned to.
You then have the opportunity to accept or reject the cookie.
Additionally, you may set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers.
Users may generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion.
In order to provide maximum site utility, Oracle also uses a tracking technique that uses embedded URLs3 to allow use of the site without cookies.
Embedded URLs manifest themselves as plain-text or encoded extensions to the URL that appears in the browser address or location toolbar.
This technology allows limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not identified to personal information and is not used beyond the session.
==========
While this increases your ability to surf the site, it does not replace the functionality or streamlining of cookies and may limit your use of many convenience features offered by the site.
To learn more about cookies and browser functionality relating to cookies please search for "cookies" in the help function of your browser.

The data we collect and how we use it
Oracle collects information from users for the following purposes:
To engage in transactions or communications.
Name, address, e-mail, purchase details, and credit card/payment information may be collected and stored as part of the transaction history.
The majority of the information collected under this category is business contact information.
Oracle may need to share some of this information (address, payment...) with delivery services, credit card clearing houses and other similarly situated third parties that are required to accomplish the transaction.
==========
To provide future service and support.
Information collected for this purpose is both contact information and information related to products and service/support requested.
This information is also used to provide service, product update, and similar notices.
==========
To select content.
Information may be collected to help create Web site content and navigation that is most relevant and user friendly.
This includes information collected as a result of site navigation as well as information provided in forms.
To respond to user inquiries and requests for information.
This information includes registrations for newsletters and specific requests for further information.
==========
To provide our customers with relevant product alerts and updates.
These updates are related to product releases, prices, terms and special offers.
These updates are only sent out as a result of the customer signing up for the relevant program or online account.
==========
To better tailor marketing to user needs.
We may use information from purchases and requirements to provide you with timely and pertinent notices of product releases and service developments that address your needs and requirements.
Marketing notices are subject to the general opt-out elections.
To better respond to requests for service or quotes for product and equipment purchase.
==========
Oracle will pass contact information to the appropriate Oracle sales person, distributor or consultant for follow-up related to your request.
Oracle may also ask if you wish to have your contact information shared with other selected partners that offer complementary products or services related to your inquiry.
While those partners have separate privacy policies, we ask them to limit the use of your personal information for purposes of responding to your request for service or information.
==========
To provide information on educational events or relevant partner products.
We occasionally co-sponsor events with partners that provide services of potential benefit to Oracle users.
We may provide information on such events and services to users that have provided information indicating interest in the subject matter or service.
To help assure respect of your information, we maintain control of the information and limit the use of the information by these partners.
To power joint sales or product promotions.
Oracle and its partners may engage in joint events or provide bundled products.
==========
Such promotions will always reference the partners involved4.
Both Oracle and the partner(s) will have access to that information.
While we carefully choose our partners, privacy is a very subjective concern and we advise you to review the privacy policies of these partners.
==========
To address performance and fix issues.
On occasion, patches and other fixes to software, such as security patches addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities, are developed by Oracle.
We may communicate the availability of these patches or fixes to registered owners of software and parties who have identified themselves to us as users or developers.
These communications will not contain marketing messages and will not be subject to general opt-out elections, due to the potential importance of these patches and fixes.
As a result of legal requirements, Oracle may be required to provide personally identifiable information to comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure or other legal process requirements.
3.
==========
Customization, Preferences and Opt Out
Oracle recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products.
Oracle.com allows you to opt out of any e-mail marketing that may result from use of the site.
Oracle allows visitors to self-select into communities as a way to provide initial customization to the Oracle web site.
There are also plans to allow users to determine the way requested information is delivered.
==========
Oracle only shares information with selected companies after providing users with an ability to either opt out of or opt into the sharing.
In some cases, where the service is designed to provide marketing, the opt out may be not to utilize the service.
The limitations to such opt outs/opt ins are in the case of joint sale or joint events where the information goes to both Oracle and the other party at the same time, where the customer has requested follow up which involves Oracle partners, and as needed with third parties required to accomplish the transaction including delivery and credit card clearing services.
As we further develop our preference tools we will endeavor to have our partners join in their use as well to provide the user with a more seamless and streamlined environment.
Please contact us if you believe you have mistakenly received information after opting out or if you would like to opt out of receiving information and have any trouble using the mechanisms provided on Oracle.com.
4.
==========
Access
Oracle has provided you with the ability to create an account or profile of information.
We maintain the information and allow you to update it at any time.
To change this information, please log in as usual and follow the prompts to "update my profile."
We continue to work on these methods to increase the scope of information that you may access and update.
Please contact us should you require further assistance concerning your information or if you have trouble accessing your profile.
==========
While the majority of questions and issues related to access can be handled quickly, a few complex requests may take more research and time.
In such cases, access issues will either be addressed within thirty days or you will be contacted as to the nature of the problem and appropriate next steps.
5.
==========
Advertising
Oracle permits a limited amount of sponsorships and advertisements on its Web sites.
No personally identifiable information is passed back to the advertisers as part of this process, but aggregate profile information, such as user community, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user.
The privacy practices of advertisers, like other external links, are beyond the control of Oracle and you should review the privacy policy of any associated site before providing any personal information.
6.
==========
Security
Oracle is concerned with the security of the personally identifiable information we have collected and has in place reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to that information.
These measures include - policies, procedures, and technical elements relating to data access controls.
In addition, Oracle uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive data such as credit card details.

==========
Compliance Issues
Oracle has appointed a Chief Privacy Officer, Joseph Alhadeff.
