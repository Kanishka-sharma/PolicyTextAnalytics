Our system is hosted by service providers whom we consider to have good reputations for both security and a robust protocol, which further protects our systems.

With whom is your personal information shared?
We may disclose depersonalised data (such as aggregated statistics) about the users of our site in order to describe our sales, customers, traffic patterns and other site information to prospective partners, advertisers, investors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

in the administration of justice; 
where we have to defend ourselves legally; or 
in complying with the mandatory requirements of a government department collecting information on employee benefits.
IP Addresses and Cookies
We may collect information about your computer including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type for system administration as part of our audit trail process.
==========
In addition we obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that.

However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our site if you do so.
==========
Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web.

More information



Google Analytics
__utmb and __utmc
These cookies work in tandem to calculate visit length.
Google __utmb cookie demarks the exact arrival time, then Google __utmc registers the precise exit time of the user.
Because __utmb counts entrance visits, it is a session cookie, and expires at the end of the session, e.g. when the user leaves the page.
A timestamp of 30 minutes must pass before Google cookie __utmc expires.
Given__utmc cannot tell if a browser or website session ends.
==========
Therefore, if no new page view is recorded in 30 minutes the cookie is expired.
Ditto


Google Analytics
__utmc
Cookie __utmz monitors the HTTP Referrer and notes where a visitor arrived from, with the referrer siloed into type Cookie __utmz monitors the HTTP Referrer and notes where a visitor arrived from, with the referrer siloed into type (Search engine (organic or cpc), direct, social and unaccounted).
From the HTTP Referrer the   __utmz Cookie also registers, what keyword generated the visit plus geolocation data.
This cookie lasts six months.
==========
In tracking terms this Cookie is perhaps the most important as it will tell you about your traffic and help with conversion information such as what source / medium / keyword to attribute for a Goal Conversion.
Ditto


Google Analytics
