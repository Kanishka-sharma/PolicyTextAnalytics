Information We Collect and How We Use The Information
DNS Services Customers
OpenDNS runs a Domain Name System (DNS) service.
==========
DNS translates a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) that allows your system to access the domain over the network.
OpenDNS' DNS service collects the date and time of each DNS request and the domain name requested ("Statistics").
Statistics are not personally identifiable but are correlated to your IP address and your account if you have signed up for one.
OpenDNS uses Statistics to provide you with the DNS service and for internal analysis.
In addition, OpenDNS also collects potentially personally-identifying information like the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from which DNS requests are made.
For its DNS services, OpenDNS temporarily stores logs to monitor and improve our quality of service, and to collect high-level aggregate Statistics.
==========
For customers without an account, OpenDNS generally removes the IP address from its logs within 2 business days, except for backup or archival copies which are not generally accessed in the normal course of business.
For customers with an account, such Statistics and data may be stored for as long as the account is open (although, customers with an account may also choose, at any time, to have DNS data purged automatically from within their account).
For customers using OpenDNS optional features such as "Shortcuts", typo correction and content filtering, DNS requests for certain domains may be directed through an HTTP proxy or other server.
The data from the HTTP proxy or other server is generally kept for approximately 24 hours for technical reasons, except for backup or archival copies which are not generally accessed in the normal course of business.
==========
Additional Information You Provide To Us and Your DNS Services Account Information
We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way.
For example, in order to use certain services or functions of our websites, such as the OpenDNS Community or OpenDNS Dashboard or to subscribe to RSS feeds from our website or to set up an account, open a support ticket, request more information, to attend a webinar or request white papers you may be required to register with a username, email address and password on the OpenDNS website.
OpenDNS collects such information and uses such information only insofar as is it deems reasonably necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user's interaction with OpenDNS, such as, to enable you to submit postings to the forums and for us to manage your account and send you notices regarding your account.
If you use our tell a friend functionality, we may also collect your friend's email address and any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily include in your email message to your friend and we will use such information solely to send the one time email to your friend.
We store the information for the purpose of tracking the success of the referral program.
If you submit a lead to the OpenDNS website, we may collect your name, company name, phone number, email address and address and we may use this information to provide you with notices regarding products and services you may wish to purchase in the future and for internal analysis.
For our paid products, we also collect your billing information such as your credit card number and billing address to enable us to bill you for our services.
==========
You can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain activities.
Aggregate Information
OpenDNS may aggregate non-personally-identifying information about the behavior of visitors to its websites and customers of its DNS services.
For example, OpenDNS may monitor which domains are most requested by its customers, or how many phishing attempts were blocked by its services.
OpenDNS may display this information publicly or provide it to others in a non-personally identifiable aggregated form (e.g. statistical form).
We may also receive and store certain other types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you interact with us, including, without limitation, the sort of information that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
==========
OpenDNS' purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how OpenDNS' visitors use its websites.
From time to time, OpenDNS may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
OpenDNS also collects potentially personally-identifying information like the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of website visitors and the Statistics as described above.
==========
Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
OpenDNS uses cookies to help OpenDNS identify and track visitors, their usage of OpenDNS websites, and their website access preferences.
OpenDNS visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OpenDNS's websites, with the drawback that certain features of OpenDNS's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
==========
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website.
OpenDNS does not control cookies in third party ads, and online visitors are encouraged to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.
The ads appearing on OpenDNS sites may be delivered to you by third-party advertising companies.
These companies may use information about your visits to these and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on the OpenDNS sites and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit the following web site http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.
==========
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
==========
Deleting an OpenDNS account.
All statistics and logs collected on behalf of an account holder are purged upon deletion of an OpenDNS account, although OpenDNS may retain such information for longer periods of time as part of its archival and back-up emergency systems.
Information on such archival and back-up systems is stored and is not accessed in the course of normal business information.
If your OpenDNS account is deleted, your postings to the OpenDNS websites (such as, in the OpenDNS Community) will still be available on the OpenDNS websites but they will only be associated with a random identifier in place of your name.
You should be aware, however, that third party search engine results may still show your postings with your username if they have stored such information in their cached web pages or indices.
Updating, Correcting, or Deleting Personally Identifiable Information
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or delete it by making the change within your edit account information page or by emailing our Customer Support at contact@opendns.com.
==========
We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We require our advertising, search and security provider(s) to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do.
