DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES


         The OSDN Sites are owned and operated by OSDN for the purpose of
         software development, discussion, implementation and innovation (the

The OSDN Sites provide technology news,
         tools, products and education for the IT and developer community.
4.
==========
REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS



         When requested, each OSDN Site user must: (1) personally provide true,
         accurate, current and complete information on the OSDN Site's
         registration form (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (2)
         maintain and promptly update the Registration Data as necessary to
         keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If, after
         investigation, OSDN has reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's
         information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, OSDN may
         suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all
         current or future use of the OSDN Sites (or any portion thereof) by
         that user other than as expressly provided herein.
Each user will receive passwords and account designations upon
         completing certain OSDN Site registration processes and is wholly
         responsible for maintaining the confidentiality thereof and wholly
         liable for all activities occurring thereunder.
==========
OSDN cannot and will
         not be liable for any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to
         comply with this Section 4, including any loss or damage arising from
         any user's failure to: (1) immediately notify OSDN of any unauthorized
         use of his or her password or account or any other breach of security;
         and (2) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end
         of each session.
OSDN handles user Registration Data in accordance with the OSDN
         Sites' Privacy
         Policy.

==========
CONTENT


         All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs,
         graphics, video, messages, or any other materials whatsoever
         (collectively, "Content"), whether publicly posted or privately
         transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such
         Content originated.
This means that the user, and not OSDN, is
         entirely responsible for all Content that he or she uploads, posts,
         emails or otherwise transmits via the OSDN Sites.
No user shall
         transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities
         on OSDN Sites that, in the judgment of OSDN, is likely to be
         prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws
         governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the
         transmission of obscenity, or the permissible uses of intellectual
         property.
OSDN reserves the right to refuse or delete any Content of which it
         becomes aware and reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose.
==========
In
         addition, OSDN shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its
         sole discretion to refuse or delete any Content that it reasonably
         considers to violate the Terms or be otherwise illegal.
OSDN, in its
         sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also
         disclose Content if required to do so by law or judicial or
         governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful by OSDN to
         protect the rights, property, or personal safety of OSDN Sites'
         users and the public.
OSDN does not control the Content posted to the
         OSDN Sites and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or
         quality of such Content.
Under no circumstances will OSDN be liable
         in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability
         for any errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage
         of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted,
         emailed or otherwise transmitted via OSDN Sites.
Each user, by using OSDN Sites, may be exposed to Content that is
         offensive, indecent or objectionable.
Each user must evaluate, and
         bear all risks associated with the use of any Content, including any
         reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.

         subject to the terms of any applicable license.
With respect to Content posted to private areas of the OSDN Site
         SourceForge.net (e.g., private development tools or mail), the

         shall be subject to the appropriate license applicable to such
         Content, or to such other licensing arrangements as may be approved by
         OSDN as applicable to such Content.

GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE


         OSDN may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the
         OSDN Sites.

TERMINATION


         OSDN may terminate a user's account in OSDN's absolute

         violation of these Terms; (2) abuse of site resources or attempt to
         gain unauthorized entry to the site or site resources; (3) use of an

         immediately deactivate or delete user's account and/or bar any further
         access to such files.
OSDN shall not be liable to any user or other
         third party for any termination of that user's access or account
         hereunder.
In addition, a user's request for termination will
         result in deactivation but not necessarily deletion of the account.
OSDN reserves the right to delete, or not delete, a user's
         account at OSDN's sole discretion, as well as to delete, or not
         delete, content at OSDN's sole discretion.

         After receiving a claim of infringement, OSDN will process and
         investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate
         actions under the DMCA and other applicable intellectual property
         laws.
Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying
         with the DMCA, OSDN will act expeditiously to remove or disable access
         to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject
         of infringing activity, and will act expeditiously to remove or
         disable access to any reference or link to material or activity that
         is claimed to be infringing.
OSDN will take reasonable steps to
         expeditiously notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled
         access to such material.
==========
Upon receipt of a proper counter notification under the DMCA, OSDN
         will promptly provide the person who provided the initial notification
         of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification and
         inform that person that it will replace the removed material or cease
         disabling access to it in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days.
Additionally, OSDN will replace the removed material and cease
         disabling access to it ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days
         following receipt of the counter notice, unless OSDN's
         designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted
         the initial notification that such person has filed an action seeking
         a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing
         activity relating to the material on the OSDN system or network.
You may provide us with a counter notification by providing our
         copyright agent the following information in writing:

         (2)    identification of the material that has been removed or to
         which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material
         appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled, including
         the full URL;
      



         (3)    a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith
         belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of
         mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or
         disabled;
      


         (4)    your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that
         you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the
         judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address
         is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which
         OSDN may be found and that you will accept service of process from the
         person who provided the initial notification of infringement.

         The Terms constitute the entire agreement between each user and OSDN
         and govern each user's use of OSDN Sites, superseding any prior

         conditions that may apply when that user uses affiliate services,
         third party content or third party software.

         that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'
         intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of
         the Terms remain in full force and effect.
