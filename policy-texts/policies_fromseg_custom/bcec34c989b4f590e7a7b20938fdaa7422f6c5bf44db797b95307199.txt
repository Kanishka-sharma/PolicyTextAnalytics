About Terminus
Terminus is an online advertising and technology platform headquartered in the United States which helps advertisers connect with consumers who are interested or could benefit from the advertisers’ products.
Terminus runs a buying platform for media and data.
==========
Our Technology allows our clients to buy ad space on websites for online advertising and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that media.
When ad space on a website is bought or sold (usually to an advertiser or ad agency by a web publisher) the Technology, as an agent for our clients, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet users who visit that site.
Generally, an Internet user’s computer comes into contact with Terminus when a user views an ad delivered or serviced by, or with, our Technology.
If you would prefer not to have Terminus serve you relevant ads, you may opt-out here: Opt Out of Relevant Advertising.
==========
Please see the section “Your Rights and Choices” below for more information.
What information we collect and how it is collected
We may collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) that visitors to our website voluntarily provide to us when contacting us with questions regarding our service, requesting a demonstration of our product, creating a user account for our products and services, requesting newsletters or applying for a position with us.
==========
Such information includes name, company name, email address, phone number, and payment card information and billing address when purchasing a service.
Account holders must provide their email and password to log in to the application.
If you inquire about a career at Terminus, you have the option of sending to us a cover letter and resume containing PII about you and which we will use solely for employment evaluation purposes.
==========
Providing this information is completely voluntary.
Please do not submit sensitive personal information to us.
==========
Our Website and Technology collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”), including, but not limited to, your IP host address, sites visited, ads seen, the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, search keywords and your computer’s operating system.
We may also collect Non-PII from clients or other third parties.
The collection tools for this Non-PII include the following:
Cookies.
Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics.
This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, making the website easier to use, measuring the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailoring their website (including the ads and offers they receive) to better match a user’s interests and preferences.
Our website sends a small amount of data, including an anonymous unique identifier, to your browser (the “cookie”), in order to allow you to access or use our service (if you are a registered user), or to navigate through the pages of our website.
==========
The cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive.
If you disable your browser’s ability to accept cookies from our site, you may not be able to access or use our website or service.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
==========
See also “Your Rights and Choices” below.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.
==========
Log Data.
We may collect certain Non-PII through our Website regarding your use of the Website, such as IP addresses, browser types, domain names, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
Such Non-PII, however, may be linked to PII.
==========
Web Beacons.
We may also use a “web beacon”(or clear gif) technology to help us understand your web browsing interest on our sites and interaction with our email marketing communications.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Information collection by clear gifs may be linked to PII.
==========
Social Media Widgets.
Some pages of our Website may include third party social media widgets that you may choose to use to allow the exchange of your information between those third party social media sites and our Website.
These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
==========
The use of the foregoing collection tools may fall under the definition of “sale” of information under the California Consumer Protection Act.
This “sale” of information is not part of service and product offerings to our customers, but rather applies only to our marketing websites and our own use of cookies for website visitors.
Therefore, a, ‘Do Not Sell My Personal Information’ link is on our marketing websites located at: https://terminus.com/donotsell and https://flipmyfunnel.com/donotsell.
==========
The use of cookies by our partners and service providers is not covered by this Policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
==========
Our Website, our services, and behavioral advertising are not directed to children under 18.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18.
Our Website does not collect any age identifying information.
If you have reason to believe we may have the personal information of a minor, please email us at support@terminus.com and we will remove such information from our systems.
We also do not collect or use financial account numbers, Social Security numbers, pharmaceutical prescriptions, medical records or any sensitive information about a specific individual for online behavioral advertising.
If you would prefer not to have Terminus serve you relevant ads, you may opt-out here: Opt Out of Relevant Advertising.
Please see “Your Rights and Choices” for more information.
How we use the information
We use collected information: (i) to provide you with our products and services; (ii) for billing, identification and authentication purposes; (iii) to administer and improve our service and website; (iv) for internal research, benchmarking and product improvement; (v) to respond to your requests and queries; (vi) perform our contractual and legal obligations we have to our customers, governmental authorities or other third parties; and (vii) for other legitimate business purposes.
==========
We use your email address to send to you service-related announcements on the rare occasion when it is necessary to do so.
For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
==========
Our Technology uses Non-PII to target and serve relevant advertising to consumers and to perform attribution analysis or other analytics regarding advertising audiences.
We use Non-PII collected from our Website visitors, subject to the users’ opt-out preferences, to analyze trends, administer the site, streamline website usability, track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
==========
The use of cookies (including the information obtained by them and the use of the cookie-derived information) by our partners and service providers is not covered by this Policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
==========
With whom we may share information
We may also disclose your personal information (within or outside your country of residence):

to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as sending email communications and processing billing and payments on our behalf.
These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us;
when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, where the transfer of your information to the new company occurs to continue providing you products and services.
==========
We may share aggregated, non-personal information with clients in connection with reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis.
In some instances we may share client contact information in an offline process that includes PII—like name, email address and company—with select service providers and partners of Terminus who provide relevant services for our clients.
==========
None of this PII is tied to any user activity in our Technology.
