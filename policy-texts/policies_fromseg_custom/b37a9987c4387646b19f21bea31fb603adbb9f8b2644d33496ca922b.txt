Effective Date: September 22, 2020
Sovrn Holdings, Inc. with our affiliates (including those not under the Sovrn brand, and collectively, “Sovrn” or “we”) provides advertising technologies that allow websites and other internet-connected services to generate revenue by showing advertisements to their users, and allow marketers and other advertisers to show advertisements to individuals online who may be interested in their products or services.
We also help our data partners meet their product and development needs by providing access to unique, diverse, and engagement-driven data from our network of 40,000+ high quality, content-rich, and independent Publishers.
This includes providing data to our clients (who are advertisers, brands, retailers, and other businesses) to target their own advertising based on such information (referred to as “Interest-based Advertising”).
==========
Specific to Sovrn Commerce, Publishers add links on locations including, but not limited to, webpages, sites, software, social media, and mobile applications to merchant destinations.
When a Reader clicks through Sovrn Commerce affiliated links to a merchant destination and then makes a purchase or submits a lead, the Publisher that generated the traffic is paid a referral fee or commission.
We also provide services to analyze the effectiveness of these services through ad reporting, attribution, and analytics.
Together, the activities described above are collectively known as “Sovrn Services”.
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how Sovrn collects, uses, and shares information from Publishers and about Readers in connection with Sovrn Services.
Our goal is to be transparent about our business by describing our technology and services in simple terms.
==========
If unsure about any of the information provided, please reach out to privacy@sovrn.com.
Sovrn Services contain links to websites or content operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control.
We encourage review of the privacy policies of such third-party websites and content before disclosing any information to them.
For information on how we collect, use and disclose information through other corporate activities, such as on our corporate website, please see the Sovrn Website Privacy Policy.
Capitalized terms are defined in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise indicated.
==========
Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the following terms:

“Publishers” are websites or publications that use Sovrn Services, or natural persons who interact with Sovrn on behalf of such websites or publications.
“Readers” are individuals  who visit our Publishers’ websites.
“Personal Information” means any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person, such as contact information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and/or phone number), and/or information that uniquely and persistently identifies a browser or device such as an IP address, mobile advertising identifier, cookie identifier, or email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, or combination of information about a browser or device (such as IP address and browser type/settings).
As explained below, Sovrn Services do not collect types of Personal Information about Readers that can be used to identify specific individuals.
“Non-Personal Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to Personal Information including aggregate or de-identified information.
Our Commitment to Good Advertising Practices
Information We Collect

Sovrn Services collects both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
Sovrn does not collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) about Readers such as names, email addresses (when collected these are hashed so that they are no longer readable), physical addresses, or phone numbers.
==========
The information we collect allows us to see the browsing habits at an individual level, but we do not attempt to identify the exact individual who is browsing.
The following provides more detail on the types of Personal Information we collect and use in conjunction with the Sovrn Services:


Cookie ID
A randomly generated identifier (created by Sovrn) that is stored on a browser and allows us to understand Reader browsing behavior, without knowing the exact identity of the individual.
Device information
Device information can include your browser agent, browser type, operating system, device type, use of ad blocking tools, and information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices.
==========
Hashed email
Hashing is a way of making a piece of data, like an email address, into a hexadecimal string so that it is no longer readable.
Each email address has its own unique hexadecimal string that remains consistent no matter where the email address is used.
IP address
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to each device connected to a computer network that allows the device to communicate on the Internet.
Most IP addresses are dynamic, meaning they change every time the device is restarted.
General location information
Using your IP address and third-party services, we may collect general location information such as your country, city or state.
Collecting this information not only supports our services, but helps us to understand your data rights.
==========
Mobile advertising ID
In mobile apps, we use identifiers provided by the mobile device’s operating system that can be reset by users.
Typical advertising IDs are AdID (Android) and IDFA (Apple).
Mobile advertising IDs allow developers and marketers to track activity associated with a specific device for advertising purposes.
They’re also used to enhance serving and targeting capabilities.
==========
Precise location information
Precise location information may include, for example, data obtained from cell tower or Wi-Fi triangulation techniques, or latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS technology, if such data is sufficiently precise to locate a specific device.
How We Collect Information

Directly from Readers
The Personal Information we gather about browsing preferences using technologies such as cookies and tracking pixels helps us provide Sovrn Services to our Publishers, which in turn provides meaningful Interest-based Advertising to Readers.
Directly from Publishers
Publishers provide Personal Information when registering to use Sovrn Services.
Alternatively, Publishers may register for Sovrn Services using an existing Google account, in which case Sovrn will receive personal information from Google as defined by Google’s privacy policy.
==========
Personal Information collected at registration may include:  a valid email address, username and password, first and last name, telephone number, website(s) URLs, software, mobile applications, log-in IP address(es), physical address, ZIP code, and country of residence for the Publisher contact.
We collect Publisher payment information from those who purchase Sovrn Services.
Sovrn provides a third-party service to manage revenue payments to Publishers.
This service also provides transactional information to Sovrn for financial reporting purposes.
We may also collect and categorize information about the content on Publisher pages integrated with Sovrn Services and link this information to Personal Information collected through the delivery of Sovrn Services.
A Publisher may also choose to provide us with log-in credentials for accounts with third-party services such as online advertising providers, in order for Sovrn to provide services, such as reporting, based on information from those third-party services.
Publishers can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but this may limit the features of the Sovrn Services available for use.
Information Collected Through Internet-Connected Technology
As Publishers use the Sovrn Services or Readers browse websites within the Sovrn Publisher network, we may also collect web viewing and search activities across non-affiliated websites (including websites accessed through your television) and mobile applications (“apps”) over time.
==========
This information may be linked to Personal Information that identifies a browser or device, typically through cookies or tracking pixels/web beacons.
Cookies
The term ‘cookies’ is used as an umbrella term for various technologies used to identify browsers, such as HTML cookies, Flash cookies, or scripts.
For convenience, these technologies are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “cookies”.
We set cookies (where allowed) for first-time visitors to any of the sites that deploy Sovrn Services.
If our cookie is already set on a browser, we recognize a returning visitor and log data using the existing cookie.
Visitors may be able to use tools provided by browsers to configure a browser to decline to receive cookies or to clear cookies, which will result in us treating the Reader as a new visitor when encountering the Services.
==========
However, in order to stop Interest-based Advertising by Sovrn, individuals must explicitly opt-out as described in the “How to Opt-Out” section.
Sovrn may store cookies on your device:

For Publishers, to allow you to use our Sovrn Services, and access secure areas of the Sovrn Services.
Without these cookies, it is not possible to load or offer key functionalities on our website, such as logging in to your account, displaying dynamic elements or uploading information.
For both Publishers and Readers, for statistical purposes and to analyze and improve the use and performance of our Sovrn Services and to do the same for our Publishers’ websites.
For Readers, to support the Sovrn Services that are described in this policy, such as for our analytics and data services and to provide Readers with Interest-based Advertising, including through Google’s Exchange Bidding service, and the ability to opt out of such advertising as further described in this Privacy Policy.
Sovrn Services may use both session cookies (which expire once the web browser is closed) and persistent cookies (which stay on a device until deleted).
For more information about how cookies are used or what information we collect, please see our Cookie Notice.
Some of our business partners (for example, Google Analytics) or clients may set or use their own cookies on our Publisher websites or through the Services we provide.
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
==========
Some of our business partners may engage in cross-device mapping.
In other words, our business partners may link the cookie data we gather to device identifiers concerning the same user.
Our business partners may then share the cross-device mapping or other user data with us, for the purpose of Interest-based Advertising.
==========
Tracking Pixels (or Web Beacons)
Web beacons or “pixels” are electronic images that may be used on Publisher website(s) or in emails sent in Publisher campaigns.
We use tracking pixels to collect hashed emails, deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and effectiveness of offers, and tell whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
Information from Third-Party Sources

How to Opt-Out

Readers
Opting Out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising:
Sovrn collects, uses, and discloses web viewing data, app usage data, hashed emails, and precise location data across non-affiliated sites and apps over time for the purpose of delivering Interest-based Advertising to this device or different devices.
Readers can choose to opt out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising activities on their browser(s) or device(s).
==========
Your opt-out choice will apply to the browser or device where you make the choice.
This means that Sovrn will not deliver Interest-based Advertising to this browser or device and we will not otherwise use or transfer data collected on this browser or device for Interest-based Advertising.
Readers who wish to opt out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from a browser for Interest-based Advertising purposes can visit https://www.aboutads.info/ to learn more about Interest-based Advertising and to exercise opt-out choice with respect to Sovrn and other companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program.
Readers who wish to opt-out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from apps on a mobile device for Interest-based Advertising purposes can download the DAA’s AppChoices app.
When using the opt-out tools above, choice will be effective only on the browser or device where choice has been exercised.
If using a different device or browser, the opt-out choice(s) will need to be renewed for the new device or browser.
Our opt-out tool for browsers is cookie-based, so that an opt-out choice can only be honored if a browser is set to accept third-party cookies.
If the opt-out cookie is deleted, then the opt-out choice(s) must be renewed.
==========
Opting out of Interest-based Advertising does not prevent data collection–we may continue to collect, use and transfer such data for other purposes such as contextual advertising based on a current visit to a website, fraud prevention, improving site performance and other purposes referred to in this Privacy Policy.
Opting out also will not stop advertising from appearing in a browser.
After opting-out, Readers may receive advertising from Sovrn Services when visiting websites of a Publisher who uses our Services, but that advertising will not be interest-based.
After opting out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising, Readers may also continue to receive Interest-based Advertising through other companies.
Using ‘Do Not Track’ Signals
Sovrn Services are designed to respect ‘Do Not Track’ (or “DNT”) signals from your browser.

Personal Data Rights

Information for Residents of European Countries: Data Subject Rights
If located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland (the “European Countries”), individuals have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of Personal Information.
Role of Sovrn as a Controller or Processor
If located in one of the European Countries, Sovrn may act as a “controller” as defined under applicable law when processing Personal Information.
Sovrn may also act as a “processor” as defined under applicable law to the extent that we process Personal Information on behalf of and at the instruction of another party, for example a Sovrn client.
Legal Basis for Processing
Sovrn’s legal basis for processing Personal Information depends upon the specific context in which we collect or use it.
We rely on data subject (as defined under applicable law) consent to process Personal Information for Interest-Based Advertising, which we require Publishers using Sovrn Services to obtain for us.
In some cases, we may rely on our legitimate interests to collect and use Personal Information, except where our interests are overridden by data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
For example, we will process Personal Information collected from Interest-Based Advertising in order to improve the Sovrn Services for our Publishers.
==========
Our legitimate interests are described in greater detail in the “How We Use Information” section of this Privacy Policy.
These legitimate interests include the operation of our business and the provision of Sovrn Services to our Publishers as required by our agreements with them.
Additionally, we may have a legal obligation to process Personal Information (such as for fraud prevention).
==========
Exercising Data Subject Rights
Individuals may be entitled to exercise certain data subject rights available under applicable laws.
These rights may include the right to request access to Personal Information we hold.
Individuals may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of Personal Information, such as profiling we perform for the purposes of direct marketing and interest-based advertising.
Individuals may also have the right to ask that your Personal Information be corrected, erased, or transferred to another party.
Where we have asked for consent to process data, consent may be withdrawn.
Anyone afforded any of these rights may exercise them by visiting our privacy center, or by contacting privacy@sovrn.com.
These rights may be limited in some situations–for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process data.
In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if consent is withdrawn.
In other instances, we may provide the requested information with some portions redacted in order to adhere to obligations of confidentiality to others.
Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, provision of Personal Information is mandatory; in all other cases, provision of requested Personal Information is optional.
==========
Data Transfers
Sovrn is a global company headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, with data centers located in the United States and Europe.
By visiting Publisher’s sites who are using Sovrn Services, Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us, our affiliates, and by those third parties with whom we may share your information, some of which are located outside of the European Countries.
These countries (including the United States) may have data protection or other laws that differ from those in European Countries.
We ensure that where Sovrn or third-party service providers receive Personal Information outside of the EEA, appropriate safeguards are in place under European data protection legislation.
Sovrn may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
Sovrn is  registered as a vendor with, and supports and encourages our clients to use, the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (the “IAB Industry Framework”) to provide data subjects with dynamic transparency into and choice about the various vendors our clients use to serve you ads, including Sovrn Services.
When visiting a website, the IAB Industry Framework is designed to allow a Publisher the means to choose which registered vendors they wish to allow to access a device and process Personal Information, and provide dynamic transparency and choice about each of these vendors (either an opportunity for an individual to consent to the vendor or opt out of data processing by the vendor, depending on that vendor’s legal basis and processing activities).
==========
Questions or Complaints
Individuals located in one of the European Countries who have questions or concerns about how we process Personal Information may contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@sovrn.com.
If we are not able to resolve the issue, individuals have the right to lodge a complaint with their local data privacy authority.
For contact details of local Data Protection Authorities, please visit the European Data Protection Board member list.
