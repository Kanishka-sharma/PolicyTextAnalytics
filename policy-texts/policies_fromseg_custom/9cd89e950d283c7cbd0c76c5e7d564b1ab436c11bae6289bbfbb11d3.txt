GE APPLIANCES CONSUMER PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE INTERNET
The General Electric Company ("GE") is sensitive to your privacy issues on the Internet.
We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you which we receive via the Internet.
OUR GENERAL POLICY
When it comes to consumer data collected electronically, GE Appliances strives to provide notice, choice, access and security-in precisely the ways described below.
In general, you, as an existing or new consumer-customer, can visit GE on the World Wide Web without saying who you are or revealing any information about yourself.
==========
Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses.
This information may be aggregated on a "no names" basis to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc.
GE uses this data to measure the use of, and improve the content of, our sites.
HOW YOUR CONSUMER DATA MAY BE USED 
There are times when GE Appliances may collect information from you, such as your name and street and/or e-mail address.
==========
When information is requested, we will try to let you know, at the time of collection, how we will use it.
Usually, the personal information we collect is used only to respond to your inquiry, process an order, allow you to access specific account information, or advise you of special promotions, discounts and updates.
Individual information may be shared within the GE family of companies to better serve our customers' interests and needs.
Occasionally, we may make e-mail addresses available to our carefully selected business partners--other reputable organizations or companies (both GE and non-GE) whose products or services we believe you may find interesting or useful.
If you register with one of GEA's websites online, we may use this information to provide you with custom information about GE's offering in support of your business needs.
==========
Technologies such as "cookies" or "web trackers" may be used to provide you with tailored information.
A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize when you return.
You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
Other new and innovative technologies which may enable us to customize our offerings to better meet our consumers' needs may be used if and as they become available.
==========
NON-CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS
GE Appliances engages regularly in electronic communications with persons and entities other than consumer end-users.
This includes communication with business entities with whom GEA has an existing or prospective business relationship and their employees or agents.
In order to avoid possible confusion, the privacy options set forth below are not meant to apply to communications generated in the "business-to-business" or B2B environment.
In addition, communications utilizing GE-provided computer equipment and/or e-mail addresses are considered non-consumer usage and are therefore not encompassed by the GEA Privacy Options.
YOUR GE APPLIANCES PRIVACY OPTIONS 
GE Appliances recognizes that some consumers providing personal information may wish to exercise choice over how that information is used.
