Any graphics, text, files, or any other content submitted, transmitted, or uploaded to the public areas of the Website or through the Website by Users ("User Submissions"), or other material that You make accessible to others directly, becomes published and public information that is not protected as "Personally Identifiable Information."
Be aware that if your User Submissions includes personal information, such as your name and email address, other Users will have access to it and it will not be protected Personally Identifiable Information.
