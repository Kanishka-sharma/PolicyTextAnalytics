One of ShareThis’ guiding principles is to give our users and publishers complete and clear information on how we collect data, and to let people know, in simple terms, how they can manage their privacy choices.
Our Guiding Principles



Be transparent.
ShareThis believes in sharing our data practices with our publishers, consumers and advertisers.
In short, our goal is to give consumers tools that help them manage their data and privacy decisions.
As our products and services evolve, we have introduced additional opt out tools to give consumers immediate and greater flexibility to take control of their privacy online.
Respect the user.
ShareThis believes that when a consumer opts out of being tracked, they are opted out.

We are in the business of understanding social behavior across the web, but we do not share usage information with any third party and we do not sell access to our raw data.
ShareThis does not use or share with any third parties sensitive health-related or finance-related data that we collect and which could be considered Personally Identifiable Information.

We save aggregate data anonymously for up to twelve months, but only for publisher analytics purposes.
We ask our publishers  and our publishers ask us  to agree to keep information about our respective users confidential.
