PASSIVE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

	        In addition to the information that you provide to us when you register for a user account, we collect information about the URLs, titles and content of the web pages and other information you save to Pocket.

We also collect information about your use of the Pocket Technologies, such as what you have read or viewed, which device you used to have accessed such content, what you choose to save to Pocket, and what you choose to share with others.
We compile aggregated data by combining information from many users, without including any information that could be used to identify you or anyone else by name.
==========
In addition to the methods described above, we may also collect information using cookies or other technologies.
Cookies are small files stored on your device or hard drive that assist us in providing customized services; for example, the use of cookies allows us to reduce the frequency with which you will need to enter your username or password.
Additionally, in some cases, certain functionalities are only feasible through the use of a cookie.
You may decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features, you may be required to enter your password more frequently during a session, and you may be unable to install or use certain Pocket Technologies.
Cookies and other technologies make our Pocket Technologies easier to use and help us customize and personalize the services we provide based on your interests and activities.
==========
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN

	    	The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and other laws have been established to protect the privacy of minors.
We will not knowingly collect any personal information from young people under the age of 13, and none of the Pocket Technologies are intended to attract or be used by anyone under the age of 13.
USE OF INFORMATION

	    	We use the information we collect to provide our services, such as saving videos, articles or other content to Pocket and making such content available to you at a later time on any device that you use to access the Pocket Technologies.
In addition, if you choose to share content with another person, we will use the information we collect to provide that service.
We also use the information that you provide and that we collect to determine the format in which our content will be delivered to you, which may differ depending on your device, and to provide other services based on the options you have selected in the Pocket application.
We use the information you provide to operate and improve the Pocket Technologies, and to deliver the other products and services we offer.
For example, we may use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, to provide customer support and to supply any products or services you have requested.
==========
You may also opt in to receive communications from third parties that use the Pocket Technologies in conjunction with their products and services.
If you request information through the use of the Pocket Technologies, you may be contacted by us or by a third party to follow up on your request.
For example, if you submit a question or make an inquiry through the Pocket website, you will use the information you provide in order to respond.
==========
We use non-identifying, aggregated information to analyze the manner in which the Pocket Technologies are used.
Such aggregated information includes the manner in which videos, articles or content has been accessed, saved and shared.
We may use aggregated information to offer a list of top sites or content, or to make suggestions to our users or to report on usage and trends.
We may also analyze and use aggregated information to improve the products and services that we offer, and to develop new products and services.
==========
THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

	    	We work with hundreds of third-party applications and a wide variety of devices and platforms.
Although the Pocket Technologies may be used in conjunction with such third-party products and services, we are not affiliated with, and have no control over, such third parties.
The Pocket Technologies also enable you to share videos, articles and information with persons over whom we have no control.
==========
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
To the extent that you or we disclose your information to any third parties, including any third parties that provide products or services used in conjunction with the Pocket Technologies, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of your information.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.
Please check the privacy policy of each third-party provider of products or services.
==========
SHARING OF INFORMATION

	    	If you choose to make the content you save publicly available, we may share that information with others in accordance with the options you select.
If you request or consent to be contacted by a third party that is offering products or services in conjunction with the Pocket Technologies, we will provide that third party with your personally identifiable and other information so that they can contact you.
We will not, however, share your contact information with any third parties unless you ask us to do so or provide consent for the disclosure.
==========
We also share aggregated data and related usage information with third parties, including content providers, website operators, advertisers and publishers, but this aggregate information does not contain any personal information which can identify you or any other individual user.
The sharing of aggregated data may include reports provided to third parties based on the information we collect and analyze.
We do not control how third parties disclose or use the information we share with them.
We may provide your information to our affiliates, each of which will abide by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
We may also work with third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the products and services that we provide to you, and we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers.
The internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide to them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.
In the event that we, our affiliates or certain of our assets or our affiliates assets are acquired, user information may be included among the transferred assets.
If this does occur, your information will remain subject to the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, unless our successor amends this policy as provided below.
==========
Although we strive to protect the personal information of our users, we will release personal information if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary.
Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect as a result of your use of the Pocket Technologies.
Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
==========
SECURITY

	    	We have agreements with third parties and have adopted other security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control or under the control of our service providers.
Your personally identifiable information is protected by utilizing both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your information is stored.
It is possible, however, that a third party will circumvent such security measures, and we do not guarantee that our security measures will successfully prevent third parties from accessing the information we collect.
==========
OPT-OUT

	    	If you choose to make certain information public or otherwise consent to our disclosure of information as set forth above, but later wish to opt out and withdraw such consent, you may do so by changing your settings at http://getpocket.com/privacy_controls.
However, if you wish to stop receiving communications from a third party to whom we provided your information prior to your withdrawal of consent, you must contact that third party directly, as we have no control over their communications or use of your information.
Please take this into consideration before consenting to disclosure of your information to such third parties.
If you have signed up to receive email from us and would like to avoid receiving such email in the future, you may opt-out of receiving it by using the unsubscribe feature on any of our email correspondence.
We will try to communicate with you only according to your instructions, although it may take some time to process your request.

You may do so by logging in and choosing the option for "Edit My Account."
