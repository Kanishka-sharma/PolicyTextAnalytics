Scroll Privacy Policy
Effective July 9, 2018
Welcome to Scroll’s Privacy Policy.
Privacy and transparency are central elements of Scroll’s values and product, and we want you to understand how we collect, store and use your data to deliver the Scroll experience across our partners’ sites.
If you have any questions as you’re reading through this, please contact us at privacy@scroll.com.
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of our Website(s), our mobile apps and any associated services (collectively, the “Services”).
==========
Our values
We believe journalism should make money by creating the best possible content for readers.
It should make money by engaging you with that content, not distracting you from it.
We built Scroll to enable frictionless access to a thriving free press, funded by more than just advertising dollars.
You should have the option to pay directly for a great content experience instead of having advertising and your user data fund it.
You should get that experience wherever and however you consume content.
You should have the ability to determine how your most personal data is shared.
==========
How the service works
Summary
Scroll works everywhere you read content within the Scroll network.
As a subscriber, when you visit a participating publisher’s site, they will determine whether you’re logged in to Scroll via a cookie or similar technology.
If you’re logged in, the publisher will serve you a more private, ad-free experience, defined by our partnership agreement with them.
==========
Scroll will measure the amount of time you spend with the content and serve an element on each page which (a) signals to you that you’re logged in to Scroll and on a partner page and (b) provides unique ways to interact with the content.
How the cookies work
When you log in to scroll.com on any browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Facebook, Twitter), Scroll will set a Scroll cookie or cookies identifying the logged-in account.
As you visit publisher sites in Scroll's Network, this (third-party) cookie will be used to obtain a publisher cookie, set as a (first-party) cookie on the publisher's domain, which indicates you should receive an ad-free experience and contains an identifier but does not identify you across surfaces to that publisher.
In some cases, Scroll may use additional cookies or use browser storage on publisher sites that contain identifiers that Scroll can use to establish and confirm your identity as a Scroll subscriber, but that the publisher cannot.
At any point, you can log in to or log out from scroll.com on each or every device on which you use Scroll.
==========
However, in order to to obtain the benefits of an ad-free environment, you’ll need to remain logged in with cookies enabled.
When you log out, all Scroll cookies are deleted immediately.
Publisher cookies and other publisher-site identifiers set by Scroll will remain until you revisit their site or until a certain amount of time has passed in accordance with our policies.
At any time, you may turn on or off various services provided or powered by Scroll , such as email newsletters, mobile notifications and similar communications from the Service.
==========
A brief word from our lawyers
If you do not agree to any terms or conditions, you should not use the Services.
As set forth in the Terms of Service, you agree that any dispute over the terms contained in this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, or any other agreement we have with you, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or other third parties we don’t own or control, including our participating publishers or other partners.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies and statements of these third parties to understand their information practices.
==========
Our Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Scroll Network and Services.
What information we collect and how we use it
From you directly
Registration – Your validated email address gives you access to the Scroll network.
At this time, a separate password is not required and no other personal information is needed to register for Scroll.
Payment – When you subscribe to Scroll, your payment information will be sent directly to Stripe, our third-party payment processor.
We do not retain the credit card number or similar payment details.
We will keep your zip code to calculate our sales tax liability and we may utilize this information so that Scroll or our partners can bring you relevant content.
Stripe’s processing of your payment information is governed by its Privacy Policy.
If in the future we offer additional Services that require you to provide additional PII, we will seek and obtain your prior consent.
At any time, you can rescind this consent by notifying us privacy@scroll.com.
==========
From your use of the Scroll Network and Services
As you visit participating publisher sites in the Scroll Network and Services, we will use cookies and other tracking technologies to capture the amount of time you spend and your completion percentage within each URL, article, video, or other content.
We use this information to:
Determine how much of your payment should go to each participating publisher site you visit.
Provide you a history of your reading across all devices.
Power recommendations and other features
Improve the provided Service using anonymous and aggregated data
Enforce our contractual rights with our participating publishers.
==========
We also collect certain log information regarding your access and use of the Scroll Network and Services.
This log information includes your IP address, device information such as browser or phone type, the URL or screen visited, and referring URL.
This log information is used to measure how Scroll is discovered by new users, to see how Scroll is used by our subscribers, to identify possible abuse, and to diagnose technical problems, among other purposes.
==========
Additionally, we use Google Analytics and other, similar services to help us analyze and understand usage of the Services and on our participating publisher sites.
What participating publishers may and may not collect
Our agreements with our partner publishers require them, to the extent they control, to provide their content to Scroll subscribers in an ad-free environment.
In addition these agreements limit their ability to use services that collect and share browsing data for advertising.
==========
This is unique for Scroll subscribers and core to our promise of delivering a more private experience to our users.
Participating publishers may still use cookies or other technologies and services to gather analytics about visits to their sites and improve the user experience.
You are advised to review their Terms of Service or similar document for more information on how they use cookies, etc.
==========
Participating publishers may also collect certain PII about Scroll subscribers that access their sites via the Scroll Network for purposes of providing this access.
However, our agreements prohibit participating publishers from disclosing your PII to unaffiliated third parties, such as for marketing purposes or online advertising.
What information we share and why
We share usage data about our subscribers on the Scroll Network and the Services with participating publishers and partners in four ways:
Monthly payments - We pay participating publishers each month based on how much you and other Scroll subscribers consume their content.
To explain these payments, we provide them with anonymized data as to what percentage of each subscriber’s time is spent viewing their content for each month.
Aggregated Anonymous data – We also provide participating publishers aggregated anonymous user data regarding their performance, in total and by individual piece of content, compared to other participating publishers.
For example, we may tell News Today that their average time per article is 0:45 which is in the 85th percentile of the Scroll network.
These metrics help them project how much money they may earn from Scroll, understand how their content is performing as compared to their peers and competitors, and create and serve better content to improve subscribers’ engagement.
==========
Your PII only with your permission - If you want to share any personal information, including your browsing history across our network, with our partners, we will give you the ability to authorize that.
We will also give you tools to manage what you’ve authorized so that you can stop sharing that data at any point.
At that time, the partner is contractually required to delete any data you’ve shared through Scroll.
==========
A brief word from our lawyers
In addition, we may also share your information with law enforcement agencies.
For example, to determine whether there has been misuse of the web site or other systems, we may report PII and other information shared with us to law enforcement officials.
We may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or subpoena (reserving the right, however, to oppose any such requests if we deem legally justified) or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our related organizations, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, to enforce our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against third party claims or allegations, and to protect the security or integrity of our web site or the Services.
We may transfer your information in the event of a sale, merger, assignment, or transfer of our assets.
==========
Keeping Your Information Secure
We keep your information on secured servers and use reasonable and industry-standard administrative and technical measures to safeguard your PII from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, and destruction.
For example, the service is only available over HTTPS encryption, and we continuously monitor our services for potential abuse.
Employee access to data is tightly controlled and monitored.
==========
Our participating publishers and other partners are contractually required to maintain the security of your information, and our credit card processing vendor uses industry-leading security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete.
Some final words from our lawyers
Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
==========
Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under thirteen (13) years of age.
You must be at least 13 years old to use the Services or to comment on any portion of the Website.
If you are not 13 years old, please do not send any personal information about yourself or attempt to sign up for any of the Services.
==========
Other Terms
If you are a California resident, California’s “Shine-The-Light” law permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your PII to a third party for the third party's direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
However, we do not rent, sell or otherwise make available your PII to others for marketing purposes.
In addition, we currently do not honor Do Not Track signals.
==========
The Scroll Network and Services are operated and hosted in the United States.
By using these services, you consent to having your PII transferred to and processed in the United States.
If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will reside on servers hosted by third-party providers located in the United States.
The Scroll Network and Services operate in accordance with the privacy laws of the United States; however, some publisher sites may be located outside the United States and, therefore, subject to that jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
Although we will collect and use your information only as stated in this Privacy Policy, United States law governing the protection of personal information may not be the same as those in other jurisdictions, including in your home country.
