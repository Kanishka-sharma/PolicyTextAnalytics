Automatic Data Collection

Listening Activity: We keep track of your listening activity.
We collect information about stations,
            favorites, artists and tracks you have listened to or in which you have expressed an interest.
Information about your computer or device: We may also collect information about the computer, mobile
            or other devices you use to access the Service.
For example, our servers receive and record information
            about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, operating system, browser type,
            and other software or hardware information.
If you access the Service from a mobile or other device, unless
            you register, we may assign a unique device identifier for that device.
Location-based information: On our Site, we do not collect your zip code, postal code, city or country
            unless you choose to provide this information to us at registration.
Your general geo-location is collected
            at regular intervals if you use the Service on your mobile device.
==========
We collect this information to provide
            content and services that are customized for your geographic area.
Tracking technology: We use what are commonly called "cookies" on our Site.
A cookie is a piece of
            information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site.
These
            cookies help us improve the Service, provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site
            usage more accurately.
For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access
            the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the
            Site.
We may also be able to capture other data such as searches conducted and results, date, time, and
            connection speed.
In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect personal information except
            with your permission.
==========
On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar.
Please refer
            to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and
            how to turn cookies off.
We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take
            advantage of some of the Site’s features.
Third parties, including advertisers and third-party advertising
            companies, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Service may also use cookies,
            and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy
            practices.
Our use of the information we collect

            We use the information that we collect for the following purposes:
        

To personalize and customize the advertising and the content you see.
==========
To improve and enhance the listener experience.
We use tracking information to determine how
                well each page and station performs overall based on aggregate listener demographics and traffic
                patterns to those pages and stations.
This helps us build a better service for you.

                newsletters and enabling you to participate in polls, contests, and boards.
To send you information about topics or content that we think will be of interest to you based on
                your preferences, habits or geographic location.
To send you information about the latest developments and features on our Service.
==========
To provide technical support.
How the information we collect is shared

            We are not in the business of selling your information.
We consider this information to be a vital part of
            our relationship with you.
==========
There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your personal
            information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
        

Information you allow us to share when you register with us, or through a subsequent affirmative
                election.
Information used when we hire or partner with third parties to provide business-related services on
                our behalf, such as mailing information, maintaining databases, processing payments, sweepstakes
                management and prize fulfillment, data processing, customer/support services and other products
                or services that we choose to make available to our registered listeners.
When we employ another
                company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they
                need to perform their specific function.
We may share your information in connection with a merger between TuneIn and another entity,
                or in the event of a transfer of all or some of our assets to another company.
We may share information with our subsidiaries and affiliates for purposes consistent with this
                Privacy Policy.
We may share your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
                action is necessary in order to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect or defend our legal
                rights or property as well as those of our business partners, employees, agents and contractors
                (including enforcement of our agreements); (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal
                safety of users or the public; (iv) protect against fraud or risk management purposes; or (v) protect
                against legal liability.
==========
Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data

            We also receive and store certain non-personally identifiable information.
Such information, which is
            collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
We may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and
            maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers.
We may use such information and pool it with
            other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to
            each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use
            and interact with the Service.
Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
            Service, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the
            personal information and other information provided to us.
==========
This research may be compiled and analyzed
            on an aggregate basis.
We may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with our affiliates, agents
            and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you
            personally.
We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and
            prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
==========
The use and disclosure of this non-personally identifiable information is not subject to restrictions under this
            Privacy Policy.
Your Choices

            You can visit the Site without providing any personal information.
If you choose not to provide any
            personal information, you may not be able to use certain features of our Service.
Exclusions

            This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personal data collected by TuneIn other than personal data
            collected through the Service.
This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you
            provide to us through the Service or through any other means.

This includes, but is not limited to,
            information posted to any public areas of the Service, such as bulletin boards (collectively, “Public Areas”),
            any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions
            (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”).
All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-
            confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited
            Information without limitation or attribution.
How we protect your information

            We have taken reasonable steps to protect the personal information provided via the Service from loss,
            misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
However, no Internet, email or other
            electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what
            information you send to us in this way.
==========
Consent to processing

            If you use the Service outside of the United States, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the
            transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such personal information in
            the United States and other countries or territories.
The laws on holding personal information in the United
            States may vary and be less stringent than laws of your state or country.
Children

            We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
If you are under
            the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Service.
We encourage parents
            and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by
            instructing their children never to provide personal information through the TuneIn Service without their
            permission.
If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information
            to us through our Service, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our
            databases.
==========
Links to Other Web Sites

            This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service.
The TuneIn Service may contain links to other web sites
            not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Sites”).
The policies and procedures we described here
            do not apply to the Third Party Sites.
The links from the Service do not imply that we endorse or have
            reviewed the Third Party Sites.
We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy
            policies.

            communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our email mailing lists, please contact us as
            indicated below.
Note however, that certain communications, such as push notifications, require you to change the settings on your device if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications.
Note that on occasion we send service-related announcements, such as disruption
            notifications, and you may not be able to opt- out of these communications.
