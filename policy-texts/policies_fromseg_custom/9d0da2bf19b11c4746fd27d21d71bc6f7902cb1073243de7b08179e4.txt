Verve Group, Inc. and VGI CTV, Inc. (together “Verve”) are committed to protecting consumer privacy and to clearly informing users about the collection and use of information.
This Advertising and Data Services Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Verve processes personal information when providing advertising, measurement, and related services to our clients (“Services”).
This Policy also describes your choices over such processing.
==========
This Policy does not describe how we process personal information relating to our website.
For information on how we process personal information relating to our website please read our Website Privacy Policy.
“Personal Information” is information that identifies you or your household or can be reasonably linked directly or indirectly with you or your household.
This Policy does not apply to anonymous, de-identified, or aggregate personal information as defined under applicable law.
Collecting Personal Information 
We collect Personal Information when you knowingly and voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you provide us feedback or request information from us.
This Personal Information will only be processed in connection with your feedback or request.
==========
Verve may identify your device and collect Personal Information using an operating system supplied ID such as Apple’s Advertising Identifier, Google’s Advertising Identifier, or a randomly assigned unique identifier (“Device Identifier”).
The advertisements delivered by Verve may include forms or other prompts that allow you to opt-in to share data.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from any child under 13 years of age.
==========
If we are informed or become aware that our Services are being used on a site or app directed at children, we will restrict the use of ad serving information to uses permitted under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
a) Location Data 
In order to make advertising messages as relevant as possible, precise location data associated with Device Identifiers may be used for targeting ads and as input into location targeting segments based on the characteristics of locations.
Location data is also used to count impressions, clicks, and other metrics to model household locations for the purposes of demonstrating marketing impact of advertiser campaigns.
Location data that you provide to an app or web site may be provided to Verve for ad serving or reporting purposes.
==========
In addition, supplemental information may also be used such as a device’s speed of movement and positioning, proximity of nearby devices, or similar information available from an operating system.
You can opt-out of the use of precise data for location-based tracking by using the settings available on your mobile device.
Ads will continue to be selected for you based on more general information, such as location that can be inferred from Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other data.
==========
b) Cookies 
We collect information automatically when you use our Services through mobile websites or HTML by using log files and alpha-numeric identifiers known as “cookies” that are usually stored with the device’s web browser.
This includes your IP address, browser type, browser language, device type and version, the date and time of your request, amount of data transferred, the source of your request (page referrer), and the nature of the content delivered to you.
==========
We generally use cookies to help with customer tracking.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and/or persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience.
Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following the directions in your internet browser.
We also use log files and cookies to improve the quality of Services and pages you have visited.
==========
In addition to the Device Identifiers described above, Verve will collect information about the type of app you are using and details such as IP address, device type, carrier, and operating system.
Verve utilizes this information to uniquely identify mobile devices to deliver targeted marketing messages to consumers.
We believe that the presentation of relevant marketing messages assists in providing a more meaningful mobile web experience.
For example, this technology enables Verve to limit the number of times a specific message is presented to a consumer (frequency capping), to support product category preferential marketing and to deliver advertising based on your location.
==========
c) Web Beacons 
We may permit publishers and advertisers to use a software technology called pixels (a.k.a., web beacons), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, used to report non-personal individual or aggregate information and help us better manage content on our Services.
In addition, we may use pixels in our advertisements to let us know which ads have been viewed or to help tailor advertising.
==========
d) Information from Third Parties 
Our business partners may also collect the Personal Information from you using a variety of technologies, including cookies, software development kits, and other digital trackers deployed on websites, mobile applications, or other digital services.
They may share this information about your devices with us.
