By participating in the Council of Better 
								Business Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet 
								the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have 
								it verified by BBBOnLine.

==========
This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains the type of

								WhitePages ("MyWP").
MyWP and the WhitePages Network offers an electronic information 
								service provided by W3 Data which allows you to access a list of names, addresses, telephone 
								numbers and other information compiled from telephone company databases (the "Service").
Please read the following Privacy Policy carefully before using the Service or using the 
								WhitePages Network.
If you use MyWP or use the WhitePages Network, you will be bound 
								by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time so you should 
								check it frequently.

MYWP COLLECTS AND STORES INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VIEW AND THE DATA 
								YOU ENTER IN ONLINE FORMS AND SEARCHES.
ALTHOUGH W3 DATA DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO 
								ANALYZE INTERNET USAGE DATA TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF ANY MYWP USER, 
								SOME INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE SERVICE IS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE.
W3 DATA AGGREGATES 
								AND ANALYZES THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO IMPROVE ITS SERVICE AND TO PREPARE REPORTS 
								ABOUT AGGREGATE INTERNET USAGE AND YOUR DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE LOOK-UP HABITS.
IN ADDITION, 
								WHEN YOU PERFORM SEARCHES USING MYWP YOUR SEARCH RESULTS WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO 
								AND LOGGED BY W3 DATA AND MAY BE CORRELATED BY W3 DATA WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE 
								INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED TO W3 DATA.
What types of information does W3 Data collect?
If you are visiting the WhitePages Network, we collect the following information: the full Uniform Resource 
								Locator ("URL") of the Web page from which you came to the WhitePages Network; your Internet 
								Protocol ("IP") address, which may include a domain name; the date and time for each page you view; the 
								name of and information about any advertisement that brought you to the WhitePages Network; searches 
								you perform, links you click on; and computer and connection information such as browser type and 
								version, operating system, and platform.
We also transmit cookies to your computer so we can track the 
								pages of our Web site that you view and the order in which you view them.
==========
If you e-mail W3 Data we collect your message, the recipient e-mail address(es), and 
								your e-mail address for the purpose of sending the e-mail.
We do not send other 
								e-mail to these address(es).
If you use MyWP, we collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the registration 
								process, which can include your e-mail address as well as demographic information such as 
								gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and country.
==========
We also collect the name of 
								and information about any advertisement that brought you to the WhitePages Network.
Any e-mail 
								address that you give us during the registration process is kept separate from information collected 
								during your use of the Service and is not used to correlate your identity to Internet usage path.
Demographic information is correlated to Internet usage collected during your use of the Service, 
								but we do not attempt to determine your identity by analyzing this information.
==========
When you use the Services, we transmit cookies to the hard drive of your computer.
These cookies 
								assign your Web browser a unique series of numbers, letters, or characters that enable W3 Data's 
								servers to recognize and identify your Web browser when you are using the Service.
They also 
								enable W3 Data to track and store information about your Internet usage path while using the 
								Service.
See below for more information about how W3 Data uses this data.
==========
When you use the Service, we collect information about the Web sites you visit (e.g., by clicking on advertisements) 
								and the pages you view on the WhitePages Network.
This information allows us to build our 
								database of information about related Web pages.
Thus, for every Web page you view while 
								using the Service, the Service transmits and stores the following information from your 
								computer to W3 Data:
									
your IP address, which may include a domain name;
the full URL of the Web page you are visiting;
general information about your browser;
general information about your computer's operating system;
your cookie number; and
the date and time the above information is logged.
All of the above information is logged together in a single data string for each Web page you visit.
Each string is logged in our database.
==========
Does W3 Data collect personally identifiable information?
The URLs we collect through the Service sometimes contain personal information about you.
For example, when you enter information on a Web page (e.g., when you complete an online 
								registration form or advertisement form) the operator of the Web site may insert that information 
								into its URL for that or the next page.
This information often appears after a question mark ("?")
in the URL, although it can appear in other places.
==========
This means that your name, your address, your 
								e-mail address, or similar information you might consider private or personally identifiable 
								which you enter into a Web page sometimes becomes part of a URL that is then transmitted to 
								Service and automatically stored in W3 Data databases.
This can also occur with words, 
								topics, products, or phrases you enter into search engines - whether those engines are 
								provided by the Service itself or found elsewhere on the Internet - while using the Service.
W3 Data has no control over what information third party Web sites put into their URLs or 
								where they put it, and any information in each URL is collected and stored by W3 Data 
								when you are using the Service.
W3 Data analyzes its logs of usage path collected from users to determine Internet usage in the 
								aggregate.
Further, by storing this information with users' cookie numbers, W3 Data correlates 
								each user's usage path information and demographic information to each other.
All transmissions between you and W3 Data, including e-mail messages, URLs, cookie identification 
								numbers, usage paths, and any personally identifiable information they might contain, pass 
								through many third party machines, operating systems, programs, browsers, Internet servers, 
								networks, routers, Ethernet switches, ISPs, proxy servers, intranets, the public telephone 
								systems, or other devices, any of which may create activity logs containing such transmissions.
==========
What does W3 Data do with the information it collects?
If you gave us your e-mail address when you registered, we may use it to send you W3 Data newsletters, 
								product updates, service-related information, and other offers and information from W3 Data or its business 
								partners.
W3 Data also may contact you by e-mail to respond to any customer service inquiries you submit.
We do not disclose your e-mail address to business partners or to anyone other than employees and agents 
								working for or on behalf of W3 Data, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements.
We 
								do not use your e-mail address to correlate your identity to your Internet usage paths.
If you do not want to receive 
								W3 Data newsletters, offers, or product and service information, simply click the unsubscribe link at the bottom
								of the unwanted e-mail message or change your preferences by going to 
								www.whitepages.com/my/login, 
								logging in, and clicking on the "Edit Profile" link in the top right navigation bar.
==========
We use cookies for such functions as verifying that you are a Service user and counting and tracking your Web 
								site visits.
We further use cookies to determine the number of visitors that came to the WhitePages Network 
								through a particular advertisement.
Your cookie number is also used to create usage paths and to correlate 
								those with any demographic information you provide, but we do not use your cookies or usage paths to attempt
								 to determine your identity.
==========
We use IP addresses to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Web site.
Your IP address also is used by W3 Data to gather broad demographic information, such as 
								your general geographic location and Internet Service Provider.
IP addresses are further used 
								to help determine the number of Service users.
==========
This demographic information may also be used 
								by W3 Data to analyze aggregate Internet usage behavior.
How does W3 Data share the information it collects?
W3 Data does not intentionally disclose personally identifying information collected from 
								any user to any third party without the user's consent.
We provide "stripped" usage path information and demographic information to researchers.
They use it to prepare analyses of aggregate Internet patterns and trends.
Such analyses 
								are used in research and commercial reports provided to third parties.
We disclose any information we possess in response to subpoenas, court orders, or 
								legal requirements, and such information might be used by the receiving party to determine 
								your identity, your Internet usage, or other things about you.
We generally do not inform 
								users of such requests for information, although we might try to do so in some cases.
==========
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, 
								such as technical support services.
To perform those functions, it may be necessary 
								for them to obtain access to W3 Data's databases and servers, which may contain 
								personally identifying information about users.
They may not use such access or 
								information for any purpose other than that for which they are retained.
In the event that W3 Data or substantially all of its assets are sold or acquired, 
								all information collected by W3 Data would be transferred to the acquiring party.
In any such transfer, however, such information would remain subject to any 
								applicable terms and conditions, including the terms of this Privacy Policy and any 
								amendment thereto.
==========
How can I view or edit my account information?
You can view or edit your MyWP account information at any time.
In order to view 
								or edit your information, login to MyWP.
Once logged in, select "Edit Profile" in the 
								top right navigation bar to view or change the information contained in your profile.
==========
How is your information protected?
W3 Data uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect 
								its databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, 
								misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data.
These risks, 
								however, cannot be completely eliminated and W3 Data therefore cannot guarantee 
								complete security.
