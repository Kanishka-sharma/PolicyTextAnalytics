The Zero Hedge site utilizes two distinct forms of cookies: 
1.
The cookies our Content Management System ("CMS") issues track information to operate the site, which includes allowing users to login and comment.
2.
==========
Third party cookies issued by third party vendors or for statistics purposes.
Among the latter, Zero Hedge utilizes various services around the web, such as (but not limited to), Google Ads and StatCounter, both of which issue cookies.
Because we don't work at any of those 3rd party companies, we're not sure what they're doing, or which cookies they're issuing at any given point.
==========
However, Google may use cookies to track website traffic.
Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site, and/or other sites on the internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the ads preference manager.
(Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting aboutads.info.)
==========
As to the former, the Zero Hedge CMS issues cookies to verify login and user ID across pages.
As a part of the session ID, we keep a copy of your IP address; this is standard behavior for our CMS.
==========
That said, it's entirely possible 3rd party cookies are keepings tabs of your time on the site (see above).
Fret not, however; if you don't want cookies to be used on Zero Hedge, read ahead.
