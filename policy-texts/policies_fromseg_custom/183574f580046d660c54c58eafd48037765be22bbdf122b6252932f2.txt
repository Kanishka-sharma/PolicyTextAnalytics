Therefore, we would like to share with you the following practices that govern how we collect, use, share and protect the information you provide to us through our website at www.6sense.com (“Website”) and other information that 6sense might collect regarding you and other individuals and companies.
We also describe the choices we offer, including how you can access and update or remove the information we have collected about you.
As used in this privacy policy, “personal information” means information that may be used to identify you personally, such as your name, street address, email or telephone number.
Personal Information We Collect and Use 

 Information Collected through our website.
6sense collects personal information from visitors to our Website that fill out the 6sense contact form.
The personal information collected via the contact form includes, for example, first and last name, address, telephone number, email address, job position and company name.
If you fill out the 6sense contact form or agree to participate in a survey or other marketing program, the personal information provided by you to 6sense could be used by us to initiate contact with you regarding your request for a quote, to process your order, deliver services and help provide better services to you, send you newsletters and updates and other information, update our records, communicate with you about 6sense’s and our customers’ products and services including new products and services which we think might interest you, invite you to participate in a product or service-related survey and generally maintain your accounts with us.
Subscriber Information and Publicly Identifiable Information.
==========
6sense provides an analytics-based solution aimed at helping its subscriber clients (“Subscribers”) predict whether business prospects are likely to become customers of our Subscribers.
We may receive data from our Subscribers regarding their prospective customers, such as sales data, web data/site activity data and lead information that is governed by our Subsciber’s privacy policies (collectively, “Subscriber Provided Information”).
==========
We also collect information through third party providers who gather such data from a variety of publicly available sources (“Publicly Identifiable Information”).
Such information could include for example, company name, name and title of the company’s officers and certain company employees, business phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, social media data and similar information obtained from the internet or published by third parties regarding such business prospects.
We may also collect non-personally identifiable information regarding business leads or other users through automated means, as described below.
==========
How We Use the Information We Collect
We may use the information you provide us through our Web page contact forms for purposes of communicating with you about 6sense products and services.
6sense may use Subscriber Provided Information to process data for our Subscribers and Publicly Identifiable Information to provide business-to-business contacts and enriched data to our Subscribers and for purposes of continuing to develop a robust solution.
==========
We limit our use of personal information to the information relevant for the purpose of our processing.
We further require any third party’s acting as a processor on our behalf to limit their use of personal information received from us to the purposes for which such information was provided.
Opt Out and Choice 
In connection with our use of your personal information to communicate with you, you will have the option of opting out and/or unsubscribing from 6sense’s emails and postal mailing lists.
You may also request to be removed from our database at any time via email at privacymanager@6sense.com and we will process your request as soon as reasonably possible.
==========
IMPORTANT NOTE: Subscribers may provide data to us for processing and 6sense data providers may collect information from the web that is not supplied directly by you to 6sense.
If you desire to correct, amend or delete personal information that was provided to us by such third parties (and not directly by you), you may contact us to access, correct or remove your information from our files.
==========
However, we also recommend that you contact the third-party website operators to whom you have provided such information under such third-parties’ privacy policies.
Please note that because searches conducted by third-party data aggregators may involve millions of new and old web pages every day, information about you may be acquired again by 6sense through third party aggregators.
==========
The best way to avoid having your information found by a search engine is to contact the operator of the website that contains the original source(s) of the information and ask for the operator to remove the displayed information from the web.
In addition, with respect to any personal data provided about you to us by our Subscribers, you should contact the applicable company to whom you provided the data (as the data provider) should you desire to correct, amend or delete such personal information.
==========

We do not collect sensitive personal information (such as medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of an individual), but if we were to do so, we would require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
