Basically speaking, there are two different types of Cookies: the so-called session Cookies and temporary/permanent Cookies stored on your data carriers for a longer period or without limit.
This type of storage helps us design our Site and adjust our offers to match your preferences, making it easier for you to use them, meaning that, for example, certain input from you can be stored so that you are not required to enter it repeatedly.
