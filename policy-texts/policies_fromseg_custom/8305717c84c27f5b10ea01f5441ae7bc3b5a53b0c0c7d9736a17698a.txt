Notice of Important Changes to Meredith Visitor Agreement – Effective March 16, 2017
Dear Meredith Website User:
We are continuously growing and improving our family of sites and services to help you make the best of your food, family, lifestyle and home.
To support the changes to our sites and services, we’ve substantially revised and updated our Terms of Service Agreement (also called our “Visitor Agreement”) and these changes will become effective on March 16, 2017.
We have summarized some of the key changes below for your convenience, but we encourage you to review the full, updated version here.
By using our sites or services that display a link to our updated Terms of Service Agreement after March 16, 2017, you agree to our updated Terms of Service Agreement.
Key Updates:
Arbitration.
We’ve added an arbitration agreement that requires most disputes with our users to be resolved on an individual basis and through binding arbitration instead of in court.
Arbitration is a faster and more efficient way to resolve legal disputes, and it provides a good alternative to state or federal courts, where the process could take months or even years.
However, if you prefer to opt-out of the arbitration agreement, you can do so easily within 30 days of becoming subject to our updated Terms of Service Agreement.
Just follow the simple opt-out instructions in Section 15.6.
==========
E-commerce.
Because we’ve expanded the e-commerce features of our services, we’ve added terms that govern orders, payments, cancellations and other aspects of transactions with our sites.
Ratings and Reviews.
We’ve added terms to help ensure the user ratings and reviews you may see on our services are authentic and helpful to you, such as rules against posting reviews in exchange for payments or other benefits.
==========
Electronic Communications.
We want to keep up with technology and communicate with you in the most efficient and practical way, so we’ve clarified that we may communicate and transact with you electronically and that our electronic communications will have the same contractual and legal effect as if they were made “in writing.”
Additional Terms.
Our updated Agreement explains that you may be provided with additional site-specific terms and policies when you visit our sites, and that those additional terms are considered part of our Terms of Service Agreement.
Also, the updates explain that certain tools, features or offerings on our sites are provided by third-parties whose terms of service may differ from ours.
==========
Other Changes.
We reorganized, clarified or otherwise changed many other things about our Terms of Service Agreement with the goal of letting you know what to expect when using our sites and creating terms that are fair both to you and to us.
We encourage you to read the full version of our updated Terms of Service here.
If you have questions about our updated Terms of Service Agreement, please contact us at help@mymagazine.store.

Our Visitor Agreement is intended to make our sites safe and fun for everybody.
We invite you to bring to our attention any content on our sites you believe to be inaccurate, inappropriate or in violation of these rules.

Though we hope the advertisers, merchants and users you meet through our sites treat you honorably and fairly, we can't vouch for the information, goods, or services they offer.
Before you act on information you've found on or through any of our sites, confirm any facts that are important to your decision.

If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Meredith reserves the right to (i) cancel your order and provide you a refund for the amount paid for the Product (if the Product is a one-time order), (ii) substitute the Product with a similar Product (if the Product is subject to a subscription) or (iii) issue you a pro rata refund.

Dispute Resolution.
Please read the following arbitration agreement in this section ("Arbitration Agreement") carefully.
It requires you to arbitrate most disputes with Meredith and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
15.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
You agree that any dispute between you and us relating in any way to the Services, our advertising or marketing practices, any Products sold or distributed through the Services, or this Agreement, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Meredith may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
==========
This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.
IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH MEREDITH, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST MEREDITH ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.
INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING COVERED CLAIMS AGAINST MEREDITH ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
15.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
==========
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to John Zieser, General Counsel, Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.
Disputes involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS' most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
==========
JAMS's rules are also available at www.jamsadr.comor by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Meredith will pay them for you.
In addition, Meredith will reimburse all such JAMS' filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an amount in controversy totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
==========
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
15.3 Authority of Arbitrator.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Meredith.
==========
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
==========
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
==========
15.4 Waiver of Jury Trial.
YOU AND MEREDITH HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PERMITTED HEREIN) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
You and Meredith are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in section 15.1 above.
An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.
However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
