II.
==========
What information do we collect from you?
In order to provide Services and maintain our Sites, NetZero collects two types of information 
from its users and visitors: personal information and non-personal information.
Our primary goal in collecting these types of information from you is to 
provide you with a customized experience while using the Services on our Sites 
- not to raise concerns about the safety and security of your information.
Personal information.
Depending on the Service, we may collect personal 
information (including, but not limited to your name, address, zip code, country, phone 
number and e-mail address), demographic information (including, but not limited 
to your age, household size, income level, education, gender, information about 
your business and birth date), financial information (including, but not 
limited to your credit card information) and psychographic information 
(including, but not limited to your reason for Internet use, reason for  
use of the Services and the Sites and topics of interest to you).
Non-personal information.
This refers to information that by itself cannot be 
linked to your personal identity (such as your NetZero member number).
We 
automatically gather certain non-personal information about you based upon your 
activity on the Sites or the way you use our Services.
We also collect machine 
data (such as processor type and speed, account information, operating system 
type, internet connection speed, browser type, audio devices, modem devices, 
video cards and any software on your computer that may interact or interfere 
with our software or Services) and your web browsing information (such as a web 
Sites' Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which 
URL you next go to, access times on a URL, certain non-identifying purchase 
transaction details and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address from which 
you have accessed the Sites).
III.
==========
Where do we collect your information?
Registration and online forms.
We collect information that you submit on 
registration forms, surveys, questionnaires, responses to sweepstakes or other 
special offers, or other online forms or interactive portions of our Sites.
We 
may also collect information from users and visitors to our Sites regarding the 
referring URL, IP address, which browser a person used to come to the Sites and 
the pages of our Sites that a user or visitor viewed during one's visit.
Third-party sources.
We may gather new information or update existing information from 
other sources including, but not limited to, for example, verifying and 
updating your address using third-party services, using various methods to 
update your credit card expiration date or collecting or comparing information 
from our subsidiaries.
==========
Online surveys.
When you participate in an online survey sponsored by a NetZero entity or a 
trusted partner, we may ask you for certain information, for example, 
demographic information (like your zip code, age or income level) and your 
hobbies and interests in order to track responses.
Contests and Sweepstakes.
==========
We may run contests, sweepstakes and other 
promotions on our Sites or through our Services, in which we may request 
entrants to provide personal and/or contact information.
NetZero uses the information 
collected in the entry form to verify the entrant's identity, age and to 
communicate with entrants.
We will not knowingly permit children under the age 
of 13 to participate in contests or sweepstakes.
We may also co-sponsor a 
contest or sweepstakes with a trusted partner contractually obligated to 
protect your personal information with whom we will share information obtained 
as a result of participation in the contest or sweepstakes.
==========
Technical/Support Information.
If you contact us by e-mail or other means for 
technical support or information related to the Service, we may keep a record 
of your communication and its resolution.
Thus, if you report a problem with 
our Services or Sites, we may collect such Information in a file specific to 
you.
Moreover, if you contact us through our feedback area, we require your 
name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply.
Additionally, if other 
users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings 
on our Sites, we may keep the Information in a file specific to you and/or the 
investigation and action we take.
IV.
How is your information used?
==========
NetZero uses the Information it collects to provide you with more relevant services, 
including, online shopping, third-party offers, contests, promotions, surveys 
and advertising.
To accomplish this we may collect and perform research on the Information 
from our users and other parties that provide similar types of consumer information.
This research is compiled, analyzed and used to better serve our users, 
third-party advertisers, and trusted partners.
In particular, we have 
described below some of the ways we use the Information you provide: 


Personalize your experience.
Information is used to tailor your experience of 
our Services on the Sites, such as by displaying advertisements and content 
that might be of interest to you.
Respond to inquiries.
If you request information from us, then we will collect Information 
from you in order to respond to your requests or inquiries.
==========
Understand user needs and trends.
We use Information to do internal research on our 
users' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand and serve our 
users and visitors.
We also collect Information regarding the referring URL, 
your IP address, which browser you used to come to the Sites and the pages of 
our Sites that you viewed during your visit.
==========
E-mail and direct mail marketing.
You may agree to receive e-mail, 
advertisements and promotions from us, third-party advertisers, and trusted 
partners regarding products or services we believe you may be interested in, 
new features or products we are introducing, tips on product use, and 
promotions.
If you later decide that you wish to cease receiving such e-mail 
or direct mail marketing, you may do so at any time by opting-out of 
participation in these marketing activities.
==========
Since it is necessary for us to contact you regarding 
certain matters, you may not opt-out of receiving messages related to material 
company announcements or policy changes, or administrative matters relating to 
your account, like billing, collections, customer service or the like.
If you subscribe to a free or 
discounted version of a Service, you acknowledge that as a condition of 
receiving such free or discounted Service, you may be required to receive information 
and advertising related to products and services offered by NetZero.
You 
further acknowledge that any such advertisements and information may be an 
inseparable part of the free or discounted Service, and in order to opt-out of 
receipt you may be required to terminate the relevant Service.
==========
Diagnose service problems.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems 
with our Services, servers, software, and to administer our Sites.
We also 
review "log-file" data to monitor Sites performance and analyze traffic and 
usage patters of our Sites.
V. Do we monitor your online communications?
We will not intentionally monitor or disclose any 
private e-mail messages or online communication between you and a third party, 
although we reserve the right to monitor accounts that we believe, in our sole 
discretion, to be acting in violation of the Terms of Service or any applicable 
law or regulation; to protect the integrity of our Services or the Internet 
community as a whole; in an emergency situation; or pursuant to request of 
governmental or legal authority.
==========
VI.
Who is collecting your information?
NetZero takes great care to ensure our users' 
privacyâ€”but not every company has comparable policies.
While you are on the Sites 
or utilizing our Services we will be collecting Information, unless it is 
specifically stated otherwise.
==========
Some of our Services are offered in conjunction 
with third-party advertisers or our trusted partners in a co-branded manner.
When 
we offer you co-branded services or products and you respond with your information, 
we may share your personal information with our third-party co-branding partner.
Once you leave our Sites, we cannot assume any responsibility for any other content 
or practices of unaffiliated sites.
Providers of unaffiliated Internet sites or 
services have separate data and privacy practices independent of our Policy 
that govern the manner in which they use the information that you provide to 
them.
Even within our Sites, many of the features and much of the content is 
supplied by third parties (or jointly by NetZero and one or more third-party 
advertisers or trusted partners), each of which has its own privacy policies 
and practices, and the Sites may link to some pages provided by third-parties 
that are co-branded by us and the provider.
==========
VII.
With whom do we share your information?
Except as otherwise described in this Policy, we will 
not disclose or share your unaggregated personal information to an unaffiliated 
third party unless you consent to the disclosure of such information.
Sale or rent of personal information.
We do not rent or sell your unaggregated personal information to anyone without 
your express consent.
==========
Our service providers.
Like many companies, we work with service providers 
who provide services to us.
We may share your information with these service 
providers in order for them to provide their services on our behalf, such as 
administering surveys, promotions, conducting data processing or analysis, or 
providing advertising on our Sites.
We require each service provider to use 
the information only as is necessary for the service provider to complete its 
responsibilities for us, to have in place a privacy policy similar to this 
Policy and abide by confidentiality restrictions and implement security 
measures to safeguard such information.
==========
Affiliates.
NetZero is a subsidiary of United Online, 
Inc., which is also the parent company of other entities that offer 
Internet-related services ("NetZero's Affiliates").
NetZero's Affiliates also 
have similar privacy policies that protect personal information.
NetZero is 
constantly looking for ways to streamline its technical and administrative 
processes and offer robust products and services to its subscribers.
To this 
end, NetZero may share your personal information with its Affiliates.
Purchasers of the business.
If NetZero sells, assigns or transfers the part of  
its business that provides a particular service to you, your information may be 
sold, assigned or transferred as a part of such transaction.
==========
Legal Matters; Protection of Rights, Property and Interests; Safety.
We may, without your consent, access and disclose your 
personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other 
information that we have about you or your account:Â  as may be permitted or 
required by law, regulation, rule or court order; pursuant to requests from 
governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement 
authorities; to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal 
claims; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations 
potentially involved in, or take any action regarding, suspected fraud, 
violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be 
illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
Additionally, we may disclose your 
personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving 
potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we 
believe that your personal information in any way relates to that threat.
==========
VIII.
How may you access or update your information?
The information you provide during registration for, or during your use of, the Services 
is placed in your Personal Profile.
You may access or update the information 
contained in your Personal Profile on the Sites at any time or through other 
methods provided through our Services.
NetZero may update the information 
in your Personal Profile with information obtained through generally accepted 
methods of address verification.
IX.
==========
How do we protect your information?
NetZero uses security systems and secure computers to protect your information.
For example, the information in your Personal Profile is password-protected so that 
only you may access or change the information.
==========
You should not share your 
password with anyone.
NetZero personnel will never ask you to divulge your 
password in written or electronic communications.
We will only ask you for your 
password when you contact us and only in cases where you request customer 
service to correct a service problem which requires your password.
==========
Additionally, when highly confidential information, such as a credit card 
number, is transmitted through our websites, it is encrypted by using Secure 
Socket Layer (SSL) software.
Please be aware that Internet security technology 
changes rapidly and data transmission is never 100% secure.
We cannot guarantee 
that any safeguards we use will completely protect your information from 
security threats whether now or in the future.
You should also be aware that 
despite our efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of 
your information.
Accordingly, we are not able to guarantee the security of 
the information you transmit when utilizing our Services.

==========
A note about international users.
The information we collect from users is processed and maintained in the United States, 
where privacy laws may not be as protective as in your home country.
If you 
are using our Sites from outside of the United States, by providing information 
to us you are consenting to the transfer of the information to the United States 
for processing in a manner consistent with this Policy.
XI.
==========
A note about the privacy of children ages 13 to 18.
We collect, use, and disclose information about children ages 13 to 18 in the same 
manner as we do for adults.
We believe that it is especially important to 
protect childrens' privacy online and encourage parents and guardians to spend 
time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet 
activity.
If you are under 18, we recommend you get your parents' permission 
before disclosing any information about yourself to anyone on the Internet.
We 
do not filter advertisements or other content that children may receive, and 
they could receive content and materials from the Internet and/or advertising 
that are inappropriate for children.

to receive.
Pixel tags and cookies are used in those e-mail messages to help

for placing and using such cookies and may collect information about you 
through such cookies.
We do not have access to such cookies, control the use 
of such cookies or have control over the privacy policies of such parties.
==========
Please also note that certain types of e-mails available through the Services 
on our Sites may automatically log you into the Sites and/or set new cookies 
when you click on the links in the e-mails and that you may need to manually 
remove such cookies if you do not want them to be set on your computer.

can reject cookies by modifying your web browser setting accordingly (each 
browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to
