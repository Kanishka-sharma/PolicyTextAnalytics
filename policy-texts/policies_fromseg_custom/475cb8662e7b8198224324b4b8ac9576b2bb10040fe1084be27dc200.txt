This is called interest-based or online behavioral advertising.

They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities.
These ads might be served on websites or on apps.
They might also be served in emails.
We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads.
They might be about our products or other companies' products.
