==========
We collect information this way.
We also have Service Providers that collect information this way.
==========
This is called interest-based or online behavioral advertising.
Discover uses interest-based advertising to target its advertising more effectively.
Interest-based advertising or 'online behavioral advertising' includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return.
They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities.
These ads might be served on websites or on apps.
They might also be served in emails.
We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads.
They might be about our products or other companies' products.
==========
How you can opt out of interest-based advertising.
There are several ways you can opt-out of interest-based advertising.
You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from Discover or its partners using this tool.
You can opt-out right from the ad itself.
==========
Ads served using interest-based advertising will have an Advertising Option icon in the ad.
If you see that icon on Discover ads, you can click on it.

You will then get an option to opt-out.
The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes generally.
==========
On mobile devices, you can control device-level advertising privacy settings.
