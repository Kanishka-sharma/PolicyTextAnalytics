PRIVACY POLICY
‍
The ADIKTEEV Privacy Policy was updated on April 8th, 2020.
Your personal data is important to Adikteev (“ADIKTEEV” or “We”).
So We have developed a privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) that explains how We use, disclose, transfer and store your personal data that we collect from (i) our website www.adikteev.com (the “Website”), and (ii) the operation of our advertising services that We provide to advertisers that market, offer and/or operate applications that you may access (the “Services”).
