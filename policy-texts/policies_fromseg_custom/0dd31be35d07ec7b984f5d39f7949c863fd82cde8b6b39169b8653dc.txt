        to administer our Web site.
Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic 
        information (e.g., number of users from Mexico).
==========
We use cookies to simplify 
        the login process (e.g., if you want FeedBurner to 'remember you', so 
        that you don't need to sign in the next time you visit the site).
In 
        order to use FeedBurner, your web browser must accept cookies.
==========
Our site's initial registration form requires NO 
        personal information.

        such as an email address, during their use of our service.

        opt-out of receiving future notifications (See How 
        can I view, change, or correct my personal information below).
This site and the notifications it distributes to its 
        users contain links to other sites.
FeedBurner is not responsible
         for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
==========

        loss, misuse and  alteration of the information under our control.
==========
Furthermore,
        an individual's  FeedBurner account can only be accessed by using a password
        that individual  creates.
Does FeedBurner share my personal information with others?
No.
==========
However, FeedBurner will partner with several affiliates in order 
        to offer our services to their users.
If you sign 
        up with FeedBurner through one of these affiliates, you may be considered 
        a customer of both that affiliate and FeedBurner, and therefore your 
        personal information will be subject to both their privacy policy and 
        our own.
Such situations will always be presented to our users in the 
clearest possible terms on an opt-in only basis.
Will FeedBurner deliver unsolicited messages to me?
No.
==========
FeedBurner only contacts you when you have chosen to be notified 
        by this service.
The service may also contact you in order to make you 
        aware of important system upgrades or changes that affect your account, 
        or as the result of a technical support inquiry you placed via email.
FeedBurner will not sell or rent your email address to anyone without 
your consent.
