BizRate.com 
  Values Your Privacy and Security 
BizRate.com is an online 
  shopping marketplace designed to deliver the best possible online shopping experience 
  to you, our users.
You are the reason we exist as a business.
We depend upon 
  our relationship with you and remain committed to protecting your privacy and 
  security.
==========
Everyday, thousands of online 
  shoppers just like you enjoy our services and entrust BizRate.com with their 
  shopping information.
This information allows us to provide services to make 
  online shopping as rewarding and efficient as possible.
You are 
  the power behind BizRate.com.
The more you share about how you shop, the better 
  shopping can be for you and for everyone.
==========
Two Kinds of Information 
  
The information you provide 
  allows us to deliver valuable services and promotions to meet the needs of online 
  buyers and sellers.
To protect your privacy, we keep the information we collect 
  in two distinct categories: 
1.
Personally Identifiable 
  Information is information associated with you as an individual.
It is kept 
  in a record that matches it with a customer number so we can access it to make 
  the site more relevant and useful when you visit.
2.
==========
Aggregate Information 
  comes from many sources and is combined to show a big picture, such as trends 
  or statistics, and does not reveal the identity of the individuals who shared 
  it.
This information is used primarily for research purposes.
How 
  We Use the Information You Provide  
Personally Identifiable 
  Information 
You control the personally 
  identifiable information you share with us.
We use it to provide you with a 
  better shopping experience and to enhance our ability and the ability of our 
  participating online stores to serve you.
Online stores and others who are part 
  of the BizRate.com shopping community may work with us to deliver personalized 
  discounts and promotions to you, but they do NOT have access to your personally 
  identifiable information.
Your personally identifiable 
  information will NEVER be sold to third parties for marketing purposes.
For example, we will NEVER sell your phone number to telemarketers or a list 
  containing your mailing address to "junk mail" marketing companies.
Aggregate Information 
  
Aggregate Information allows 
  people and their businesses to be smarter about online shopping.
==========
When a business 
  knows more about its customers, they both win.
Without giving out personally 
  identifiable information, we make aggregate information available to online 
  stores or other third parties that deliver valuable products or services to 
  our users.
BizRate.com provides timely, 
  insightful and detailed analysis of online buying and customer satisfaction 
  through a variety of reports.
By sitting at the point-of-sale across thousands 
  of quality online retailers, BizRate.com is uniquely positioned to monitor e-Commerce 
  activity across the Web, soliciting information from millions of online buyers 
  like you as they make their purchases.
How 
  We Gather Information  
BizRate.com Surveys.
When you complete a survey after purchasing from a BizRate.com Customer Certified 
  online store, the only information we require is your email address.
Your valid 
  email address allows us to certify that you are an actual customer and to send 
  you a follow-up survey about your satisfaction following delivery.
We ask for your demographic 
  information (like gender, age range, occupation, education level, income, marital 
  status, and zip code) but this is always voluntary.
This information is used 
  in aggregate, or to enhance the level of service BizRate.com can provide you.
==========
We mainly use your survey 
  data to rate an online store's performance.
Your feedback allows online shoppers 
  to benefit from your experience.
We compile the survey responses of online consumers 
  into marketing research reports that provide insights about the current trends 
  in the world of e-commerce.
At no time in the survey process does any outside 
  party have access to your personally identifiable information.
The only exception 
  is that, at your request only, we will forward your email address and comments 
  to the online retailer for whom you completed a survey, so that they may respond 
  directly to any comments you might have provided.
We may also gather statistics 
  about the use of various aspects of the service for administrative purposes 
  or to determine what services to offer or enhance.
==========
