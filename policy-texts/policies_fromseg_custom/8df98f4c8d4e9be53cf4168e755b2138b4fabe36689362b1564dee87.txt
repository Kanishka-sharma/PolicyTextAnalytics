A Special Note About Children 
Electronic Arts encourages parents to spend time online with their children.
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet.
We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children.
==========
Therefore, with respect to children residing in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to Electronic Arts' online sites by children 12 years of age or under.
In order for children 12 years old and under in such jurisdictions to participate in online activities that require registration, we require prior written permission or other verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
In other jurisdictions, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may be required from a parent or guardian for children under 14 or 18 years of age.
Upon registration, the appropriate permission form will be made available.
This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Electronic Arts by fax or mail to the Privacy Policy Administrator in the relevant country.
Children 12 and under may not participate on certain of our sites.
In some cases, we may not permit children under 14 or 18 years of age to participate in certain of our sites.
Once we have obtained parental consent, we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personally identifiable information maintained by Electronic Arts is not correct or complete, should you wish to have your child's personal information deleted from our records, or if you want Electronic Arts to discontinue further collection or use of your child's personal information, please contact your Privacy Policy Administrator who will be happy to review, update or remove your child's information as appropriate.
