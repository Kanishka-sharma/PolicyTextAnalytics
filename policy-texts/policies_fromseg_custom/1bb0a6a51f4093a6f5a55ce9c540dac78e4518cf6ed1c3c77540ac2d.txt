Data Protection and Privacy
Full details of the way in which we use cookies on the Site and how we hold and process information from which we can identify you or any third party are set out in our Privacy Statement.
E-commerce


Most of the online sales and other e-commerce services available via the Site are provided either by us as an agent for third party suppliers or directly by third parties via websites that are framed on the Site.
==========
For some goods and services (Such as Fantasy Football), however, we act as principal meaning that the resulting legal contract for the goods or services in question will be made directly between you and us.
Where we act as principal, specific terms and conditions will apply to any resulting online sales and these will be drawn to your attention before the sale is complete.
==========
Where we act as agent for third party suppliers or where we frame third party websites, the following applies:

the contract for the goods or services in question will be made directly between you and the relevant supplier.
In most cases this will mean that there will be separate terms and conditions governing the contract (in addition to the GiveMeSport Shop terms and conditions which will apply when purchasing from the GiveMeSport Shop) as each supplier will have its own terms and conditions relating to the supply of those goods or services.
Please make sure that you have read the relevant supplier's terms and conditions before completing your transaction.
You can obtain a copy of the relevant supplier's terms and conditions by contacting the supplier directly; and
we have no contractual liability to you in respect of the goods or services provided by the third party supplier.
==========
We may, however, still be liable to you if we have been negligent, if we have misrepresented important information or if we have been in breach of any other relevant law.
Third party links

We are not responsible for, nor do we endorse in any way such third party websites or their content.
If you decide to access any of the third party websites linked to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk.
==========
