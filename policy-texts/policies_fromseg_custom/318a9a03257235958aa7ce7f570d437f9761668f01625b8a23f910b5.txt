CondéNet sites are committed to bringing you information
                    that's tailored to your individual needs and, at the same
                    time, to protecting your privacy.
The following is a summary
                    of the various ways we treat the information you provide us

                    when you register for our services, enter a sweepstakes or
                    contest, complete a survey or subscribe to our magazines,
                    you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail
                    address, name, or phone number.

                    service you have requested.
For example, if you subscribe to
                    one of our magazines, we will use your e-mail address to
                    send you a confirmation notice and your address to send
                    you your magazine.
Similarly, if you enter an online

==========
We may also use the information to
                    communicate with you about new features, products or
                    services, or to improve the services that we offer by
                    tailoring them to your needs.
CondéNet does not sell any of our users' personal
                    information.
We may, however, share information with
                    carefully selected companies who we think can offer you
                    services and products of interest to you.

                    to have your information shared, write to us at

If you've
                    registered for any of our sites, you may also change or
                    update your member preferences or information on your
                    member's page on each site.
You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information
                    that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your
                    own computer.
We use cookies for purposes such as to
                    control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the
                    site or to record registration and personalization
                    information.
For example, if you register you can opt to
                    save your user name and password on your computer.
==========
We
                    can provide this convenience by placing a cookie on your
                    computer.
Our cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself,
                    personally identifying.
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as
                    well.
We do not have control over cookies placed by
                    advertisers.
If you don't want cookies, your Web browser likely includes
                    an option that allows you not to accept them.
We don't
                    recommend using this option, though: It makes browsing
                    our site a less enjoyable experience.
==========
We also allow access to our database by third parties that
                    provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or
                    forums software, but only for the purpose of and to the
                    extent necessary to provide you with those services.
Any
                    third party who has access to our database for this purpose
                    is bound by the terms set forth in this policy.
There may
                    also be occasion when we are legally required to provide
                    access to our database in order to cooperate with police
                    investigations or other legal proceedings.
In those
                    instances, the information is provided only for that purpose.
Finally, while your individual information is protected as
                    outlined above, we reserve the right to use aggregated,
                    anonymous data about our users as a group for any
                    business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and
                    seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

No one under age 13 is

If your kids disclose information about themselves in our
