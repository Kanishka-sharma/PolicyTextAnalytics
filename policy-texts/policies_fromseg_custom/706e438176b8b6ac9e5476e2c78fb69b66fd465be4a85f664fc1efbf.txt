Rights for Minors: A business cannot sell the personal information of minors under the age of sixteen (16) without their permission and, for children under thirteen (13), without parental consent; and
Right to Non-Discrimination: A business may not discriminate against consumers who exercise their rights under the CCPA.
Right to Know (i.e., Information About and Access to Your Personal Information)
You have the right to request that we disclose personal information we collected about you pursuant to Civil Code sections 1798.100, 1798.110, or 1798.115 including any or all of the following:
Specific pieces of personal information that we collected about you;

Categories of third parties to whom your personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and

In responding to your verified consumer request to know, we will provide information on:
The categories of personal information we collected about you (e.g., IP address, geolocation data, internet activity such as web browsing histories, and professional or employment-related information) in the preceding twelve (12) months from the date we receive your request;

==========
The CCPA also requires that if requested, we provide you with responsive materials in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit your information from one (1) entity to another without hindrance.
Right to Delete
The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers (i.e., Partners) delete personal information collected from you in accordance with Civil Code section 1798.105.
However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons:
if we need your information to complete the transaction for which it was collected;
to comply with a legal obligation;
to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code § 1546 et seq.), as amended;
to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
to identify and repair errors that impair existing and intended functionality; or
to make other internal and lawful uses of your information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
==========
Verifiable Consumer Requests
The CCPA considers the right to know and the right to delete as verifiable consumer requests.
Verifiable consumer requests must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are in fact the California resident or Household about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We may deny a request to know or a request to delete if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request or confirm that the requested personal information relates to you.
We will only use personal information that you provide us to verify your identity or authority.
How to Submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete
Submit your request using the information in Section 7 (Contact Information) above and include the value of your tribalfusion.com ANON_ID cookie (“TF ANON_ID Cookie Value” or “Cookie Value”) as explained below.
Verifying Your Identity with Your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value
Your Cookie Value is the only repository where consumer identifying information may be stored.
To find your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value (highlighted blue in example below):
Open your web browser and go to “tribalfusion.com”;
Locate the ANON_ID cookie (see image below) in your browser’s privacy or cookie settings (location will vary by browser); and
Copy the TF ANON_ID Cookie Value and email it to privacy@VDX.tv.
Once we receive your Cookie Value, we will decode it and the values for it, and any other activity linked to it.
==========
Our Confirmation of or Response to Your Request to Know or Request to Delete
Requests to Know
Confirmation
Except where permitted by law, we will confirm receipt of your request usually by email (unless you request another method) within ten (10) business days.
Our confirmation will include a general description of our verification process for right to know requests and when you should expect a response – unless we already granted or denied your previous right to know request(s).
==========
Response
We will respond to your request within forty-five (45) calendar days – starting on the day we receive your request.
If we cannot verify your identity within the forty-five (45)-day period, we may deny your request.
If necessary, we may take up to an additional forty-five (45) calendar days to respond to your request, for a maximum total of ninety (90) calendar days from the day we receive your request.
If we need to take more than forty-five (45) calendar days to respond to your request, we will notify you generally by email and explain our reason.
==========
Requests to Delete
Response
We will notify you that we will maintain a record of the request (as allowed under the CCPA) to ensure that your personal information remains deleted from our records.
We will also inform your whether or not we complied with your request.
We will comply with your deletion request by performing any of the following:
permanently and completely erasing your personal information on our existing systems (except archived or back-up systems);
deidentifying your personal information; or
aggregating your personal information.
If we deny your request, we will (unless otherwise prohibited by law):
describe the basis for the denial, including any conflict with federal or state law, or CCPA exception;
delete any personal information that is not subject to the exception (if any); and
will not use your personal information retained for any other purpose than provided for by the CCPA exception.
==========
If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request.
However, we will inform you that your identity cannot be verified.
==========
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Information
Under the CCPA, you may opt-out of the sale of your personal information from a business to third parties.
While we do not sell your personal information suppression of any sharing of your personal information can be applied by following the same steps laid out in the Right to Delete above.
==========
Rights for Minors
Our Site and services are not intended for children.
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or sell the personal information of children under the age of sixteen (16).
Right to Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
==========
We will not:
Deny you services;
Charge you different prices or rates for services by granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
Provide you a different level or quality of services; or
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services.
Who May Exercise Your CCPA Rights
Only you, a valid power of attorney under the California Probate Code, as amended, or a natural person or business entity registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that you authorize to act on your behalf (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request to know or delete related to your information.
If you wish to submit a request to know or a request to delete via an Authorized Agent, your Authorized Agent must provide us with written and signed permission from you to submit the request(s).
==========
“Signed” means that the written attestation, declaration, or permission has either been physically signed or provided electronically per the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Civil Code section 1633.7 et seq.
Next, contact us (as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above) so we may verify your identity and confirm that you provided the requesting Authorized Agent permission to submit the request(s).
==========
Fees
We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive.
If we reasonably determine that the request requires a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and give you a cost estimate in writing before completing your request.
==========
Shine The Light Law
Separate from the CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, as amended, also known as the “Shine The Light” law gives California residents the right to request and obtain what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for such third parties to directly market their services to you.
If you have any questions about our Shine The Light Law practices, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.
==========
Do Not Track
California law requires us to tell you how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.
DNT allows users a way to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
==========
Disclosure of Consumer Requests
As required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), VDX.tv handled the following types of consumer requests during the year 2020:
Type of Request Received Fulfilled Denied Average Response Time
Subject Access 25 25 0 8 days
Data Removal 48 48 0 5 days
Opt-out/Delete 63 62 0 10 days
Note, these are global numbers, not only from California residents.
In terms of the data we use, “opt-out” is the same as “delete”.
“Data Removal” in the table above means that if we receive a request regarding data on one of our partner publisher websites, over which we have no editorial control, we will forward the request to the partner publisher for further action.
