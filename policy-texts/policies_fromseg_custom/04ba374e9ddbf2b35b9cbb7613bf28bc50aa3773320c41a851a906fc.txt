LandAndFarm.com Privacy Notice
For those who view or post LandAndFarm.com listings:
Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to LandAndFarm.com, our registered listing partners, and our advertisers.
Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients, customers and visitors.
Below, please find below a description of how LandAndFarm.com strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium for all to enjoy.
User Information (Searching)
All users who view listings on LandAndFarm.com retain complete anonymity where LandAndFarm.com is concerned.
As the listings appear in your web browser, LandAndFarm.com does not acquire or collect any personal information about you.
Registration Information (Listing)
LandAndFarm.com regards all personal information collected from its registered partners and customers as confidential, except for those items that appear in the listings, such as Name, Address, Email Address, Phone Numbers and all property data and all other data that is available to public viewers of the web site.
All other personal data provided during registration processes and financial account information (credit card / bank information) is kept strictly private.
LandAndFarm.com does forward certain property listings to third parties as part of marketing agreements LandAndFarm has with those third parties.
LandAndFarm does not sell its customer lists or information in the listings to mass marketing entities, though it reserves the right to do so, with the understanding that we will inform our users of any such agreement on our web site and in our newsletter.
As of the date of this notice (8/2001) no such agreements exist.
