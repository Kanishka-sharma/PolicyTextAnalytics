Overview

Flurry, Inc. takes the privacy of our customers ("Customer" or "you" or "your") and their end users ("End Users") seriously.
We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind.
This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information and information regarding your End Users is collected, used, and disclosed by Flurry, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and any parent and affiliated companies ("Flurry", "us" or "we") with respect to the services referred to in this Policy.
This Policy applies to the websites provided by Flurry (collectively the "Sites") and the Flurry services outlined below (collectively, "Flurry Services").
This Policy does not apply to websites, applications or services that display or link to different privacy statements.
How We Collect and Use Information
Using Flurry services:
When you use Flurry Services, we may request information, including your first and last name, an email address and password, and your cell phone number to create your Customer account.
We use such information to manage your account and to provide you with access to the Flurry Services.
We may also use the information to notify you of updates to the Flurry Services and provide you with access to special promotions.
Via Email:
We place email links on the Sites to allow you to contact us directly.
==========
The information you provide, which may include personal information, is used to respond directly to your questions or comments.
We may also file your comments to improve the Sites and Flurry Services, or review and discard the information.
Via Flurry Analytics:
Flurry Analytics provides information to you about how your End Users use their mobile applications as well as how applications are performing across different handsets.
Flurry obtains this information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our software "agent" if embedded by you in an End User's mobile application.
==========
The data collected by the agent may include: agent version, platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier, Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), Model, manufacture and OS version of device, session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.).
We hash iOS device identifiers, MAC address and IMEI; however, we do not hash platform device identifiers such as the ANDROID_ID and the BB_PIN.
==========
Hashing involves the transformation of these identifiers into a value or key that represents the original identifier.
The device identifiers (if applicable), IMEI (if applicable), MAC address (if applicable), and platform are hashed to a Flurry ID.
==========
In addition, Flurry may collect the following data if you select the option for Flurry to collect and provide such data to Flurry: User ID (for your service), latitude and longitude (obfuscated by Flurry to state/city), gender, age, events, errors, and page views.
Finally, we see the IP address, device type, locale and timezone of the user through the HTTP request.
==========
Flurry uses this data to enable demographic and customer-created segment advertising targeting, create reports for you to analyze your End Users and to create reports and/or metrics against which you can compare your user base.
In addition, we may provide you with the option of exporting raw Flurry data to your servers such as timestamp, platform, event, and user ID.
You can also record errors that occur in your applications and receive an export of data containing the error information.
==========
Flurry Analytics Reports:
Your End User data collected via Flurry Analytics is presented to you to analyze your applications.
In addition, aggregated and anonymous benchmark data that includes your End User data and all other Customers' End User data is provided as well.
However, you (as well as other Customers) may opt-out of having End User data included in the benchmark data.
==========
Via Flurry Ad Analytics:
Flurry Ad Analytics allows you to segment the clicks and installs of your applications and in-app events by the traffic acquisition sources, such as third-party ad networks, email campaigns, mobile web campaigns or any other traffic source that can support third-party URLs.
In order to use the Ad Analytics Service, you must use Flurry Analytics.
Flurry will use the End User's IP addresses, HTTP headers and device identifiers through this service to help you keep track of clicks, installs, and in-app events.
Via Flurry AppCircle:
Flurry AppCircle is an ad network that uses Flurry Analytics in combination with a recommendation engine to create suggestions about applications or other products and services that may be of interest to particular End Users.
We provide the device identifiers of the End Users who download applications or access services based on these recommendations to the applicable publisher.
We also provide the timestamp of when the End User clicked on the ad and downloaded the application and may provide city level information regarding the End User's location.
You can retrieve recommendations created for a particular End User by passing the device identifier of the End User to the Flurry servers.
==========
If you participate in AppCircle Rewards, you can determine how many rewarded application installations an End User has completed.
You can pass the device identifier to Flurry and get back a list of times of the application installations.
You may also get a list of device identifiers of all of your End Users who have completed an AppCircle rewards installation.
For select AppCircle advertisers, we provide post-campaign reports including the device identifiers of End Users that installed the application and the time at which the installation occurred.
==========
You may run a re-engagement campaign to try and engage End Users who have not used an application within a specific time frame.
Flurry will internally identify End Users by their Flurry ID who have the application installed, but have not used the application within the specified time frame.
Flurry may then show them an advertisement for such application.
GetBanner is part of Flurry AppCircle and allows you to format a single Flurry AppCircle ad as a clickable HTML banner.
This allows Customers who do not embed the Flurry SDK in their applications to make use of Flurry AppCircle ads manually.
==========
The data we collect in connection with GetBanner includes your API Access Code, the API key (identifier for application), End User device identifier, platform, landscape, banner orientation, reward message, end user IP address, theme identifier, and custom parameters.
You must pass this data to us in the parameters of the application.
We do not collect the data ourselves from the End User's device.
==========
Flurry's InstallNotify API (application programming interface) allows advertisers who do not use Flurry's SDK to acquire users through the AppCircle network, and to confirm that those users converted through Flurry.
For each install, advertisers send Flurry a single API call that may contain the iOS UDID, Android_ID, a hash of the MAC address, or a hash of the IMEI.
These identifiers are used to determine if the install was driven through Flurry's network.
An advertiser may request a list of the identifiers of devices, install timestamps, and source (e.g., AppCircle) to confirm that they were converted via the Flurry network.
Flurry's Get Recommendations API allows publishers who do not use Flurry's SDK to host Flurry ad units and monetize through an API feed.
Publishers make a request to the Flurry GetRecommendations API with a call that may contain the iOS UDID, Android_ID, a hash of the MAC address, or a hash of the IMEI.
These identifiers are used to determine the set of ads that will be returned to the publisher.
==========
Via Flurry AppSpot:
Flurry AppSpot is an advertising service that allows a publisher to sell advertising space to advertisers in order to place such advertisements within their applications, including advertisements served by Flurry AppCircle.
Flurry AppSpot must be used in conjunction with Flurry Analytics and may be used with Flurry AppCircle.
==========
Age ranges, gender, device type, OS, language, analytics segments created by you, Personas (as described below) and custom key values can be used by you to provide focused advertising to End Users.
For example, you can create campaigns to run on your applications focusing on segments created by you within Flurry Analytics.
Key values allow you to pass a specific key value pair to AppSpot as part of the ad request and then focus direct-sold campaigns or network campaigns to those values.
==========
Via Flurry AppCloud:
Flurry AppCloud is a collection of mobile application development services for use in building and improving mobile applications.
Data provided through the Flurry AppCloud service will be stored on servers at Amazon Web Services.
Through the Flurry AppCloud service, Flurry will provide metrics on a number of items, such as how push notifications affect End User use of your application.
In addition, Flurry AppCloud will allow you to access some of the Flurry Analytics metrics through the AppCloud service.
Such metrics may include Personas, Customer created-segments and other anonymous application usage characteristics of the End User.
==========
Personas:
Personas are groups of End Users that share a similar interest.
Flurry uses aggregated data provided by Flurry Analytics across multiple applications to build Personas.
Based on an End User's application usage (session length, creation or interaction with an application event, or frequency), End Users may be classified into one or more Personas.
Flurry categorizes its Customer's applications under the Personas.
If an End User uses a number of applications categorized under a Persona, e.g., travel applications under a Business Traveler Persona, Flurry may place that End User within the Business Traveler Persona.
==========
Advertisers can offer ads using this Persona.
In addition, Flurry Analytics will show you metrics on the different Personas.
==========
For example, you can see what percentage of your End Users are Avid Travelers and Sports Fanatics and the actual number of End Users that are in a Persona for each of your applications.
Customer User of Data:
Flurry is not responsible for any use by Customers of any data about their End Users.
End Users should review the Customers' policies to understand their use of End User data.
Other Uses of Personal Information
Flurry may also use personal information collected from you for the following general purposes: (1) to fulfill your requests for Flurry Services; (2) to improve our Sites and Flurry Services; (3) to contact you to resolve problems; (4) to send you information about Flurry Services including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages; (5) to communicate with you about products and services offered by Flurry and our selected partners; (6) to conduct research; and (7) to make the Sites easier to use by reducing the need for you to enter information.
