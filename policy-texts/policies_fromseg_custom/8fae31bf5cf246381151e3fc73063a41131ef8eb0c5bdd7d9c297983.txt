SECTION 3: STATE AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC INFORMATION; CONTACTING US
EEA and Switzerland 
Legal Bases for Processing Information
We collect, use, share, and/or transfer personal data of individuals in the EEA and Switzerland only when we have a lawful basis for doing so, which typically entails user consent or our legitimate interests.
Where required by applicable law we only deliver Interest-Based Advertising to individuals who have provided consent for that activity.
==========
To the extent we rely on your consent, which may be provided either directly to us or via a third party, to use your information in certain ways, we will process your personal data within the scope of that consent.
In our capacity as a data controller we intend to rely on consent as a lawful basis for all “Purposes” under the IAB Europe’s Transparency & Consent Framework other than “Measurement” (which Purpose includes measurement, analysis, and reporting with respect to the applicable personal data).
==========
In connection with such Purpose, when we process data for measuring the delivery of advertising or analyzing its effectiveness we have a legitimate interest in understanding that our suppliers have delivered the advertising that they have contracted to deliver.
In addition, we believe that advertising clients have a legitimate interest in understanding whether or not their advertising is delivered and whether it is effective.
We believe these activities are fundamental to online advertising but do not result in any decisions which affect individuals.
==========
If you are in the European Union, you have the right to object to any of this processing.

Rights of Individuals in the EEA and Switzerland
Individuals in the EEA and Switzerland have a number of rights with regard to their personal data, including the right to access their information.
For these users, in many cases where we process your personal data, you may also have a right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use that personal data.
In certain circumstances – for example, where we process your personal data for directing marketing purposes or pursuant to our legitimate interests – you also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data by us, and you can also request that we delete your personal data.
You also have a right to obtain a copy of your personal data in an easily accessible format, and in certain circumstances, you may also request to transfer personal data about you to third parties.
==========
We don’t retain and store your actual browsing activity history in association with a Mookie cookie ID or a mobile advertising ID.
Instead, we use an “aggregate scoring” methodology that categorizes the Sites you browse and then use combinations of these categorizations to create segments and deliver Interest-Based Advertising.
==========
As a consequence, we are unable technically to offer the ability for you to change individual elements of data that lead to the segment allocation simply because we do not retain them.
If you believe that we hold or have used inaccurate personal data elements about you, please note that you have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data at any time.
==========
If you have questions about any of these rights, please contact us.
You should also contact us if your personal data or preferences change, if you don’t want us to send you the information you previously requested, or if you have any queries about how we use your personal data.
==========
Without limiting any other rights you may have, you also have the right to lodge a complaint against us with a supervisory authority in the EU Member State where you are based or in which we are based.

California
Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information about the types of “personal information” that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

Please allow 30 days for a response.
California law requires us to disclose how we respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals or other choice mechanisms relating to Interest-Based Advertising.
We have not yet developed a response to browser “Do Not Track” signals, and do not change any of our data collection practices when we receive such signals.
We will continue to evaluate potential responses to “Do Not Track” signals in light of industry developments or legal changes.
We are committed to honoring your privacy choices.
For more information on opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising, please see the “Opt-Out/Right to Withdraw Consent” subsection of Section 1 above.

Please review this Privacy Notice periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred (we will update the effective date at the top of the page to help you know when changes have been made).
