Except as described above or as expressly stated at the time you provide information to Inc.com, Inc.com does not provide individual information about you to others.
We do, however, receive information on individual users from our partners, who have assured us that they will notify users of their sites that they do so.
You should review the privacy policies of those partner sites to confirm the way in which they handle their users' information.
In those instances where our sharing of information is expressly noted at the time you provide it, we may provide that information to those partners specified in the notice.
The use of this information by that partner will then be subject to the partner's privacy policies.

There may be occasions on which Inc.com is required to provide information by order of a court or when the law requires that user information be treated as a transferable asset, as in bankruptcy.

We may revise our privacy policy in the future to adjust to such changes.
We recommend that you check it frequently.
