Protection of U.S. Social Security Numbers

protect the confidentiality of such Social Security numbers;
prohibit the unlawful disclosure of such Social Security numbers; and
limit access to such Social Security numbers.

Email Encryption
What is encryption?
Encryption is a way in which Citi can protect confidential, proprietary and sensitive information by converting it into a coded, unreadable format.
Encrypted email can be transformed back into readable form only by the intended message recipient.
Put simply, secure email essentially "locks" a message by authorizing only the recipient with the correct key to "unlock" and view it.
==========
Why does Citi use email encryption?
Protecting the privacy and security of employee, client, and business partner information has always been a top priority at Citi.
In keeping with this ongoing commitment, Citi now encrypts external email (both text and attachments) that contains confidential, proprietary and/or sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (e.g., social security numbers and credit card numbers).
This enables us to protect this type of information and minimize the risk of potential unauthorized viewing or malicious intervention.
How will Citi's use of encryption technology impact email recipients?
Secure email recipients should not experience any interruptions in communications with Citi due to the use of encryption technology, and no special software or downloads will be required to receive secure email.
==========
You will be asked to complete a one-time registration process.
Instructions on how to register and/or retrieve an encrypted message will be included in any secure email you receive from Citi.
The default delivery option for Citi Secure Email is Web-based via the Citi Secure Webmail Center.
If you currently use S/MIME or PGP and wish to receive secure email via one of these encryption methods, please contact the Citi Secure Email Help Desk at (866) 535-2504 (inside the U.S.) or +001 (904) 954-6181 and ask to be set up as a PGP or S/MIME user.
