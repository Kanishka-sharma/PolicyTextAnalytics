It is Pingdom's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors

                Like most website operators, Pingdom collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
==========
Pingdom's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pingdom's visitors use its website and to better provide related content to its visitors.
From time to time, Pingdom may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Pingdom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.
==========
Pingdom only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

                Certain visitors to Pingdom's websites choose to interact with Pingdom in ways that require Pingdom to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Pingdom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a account at Pingdom.com to provide a name and email address.
==========
Those who engage in transactions with Pingdom - by purchasing access to the Pingdom paid service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
In each case, Pingdom collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Pingdom.
Pingdom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
==========
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

                Pingdom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Pingdom's behalf or to provide services available at Pingdom's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Pingdom's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Pingdom will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Pingdom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Pingdom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Pingdom, third parties or the public at large.
