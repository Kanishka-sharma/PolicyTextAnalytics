Your California Privacy Rights
Overview
At Nordstrom, we appreciate the trust you place in us when you choose to visit our stores and use our websites and mobile applications, and we take that responsibility seriously.
This California Privacy Rights Notice (the "Notice") supplements the Nordstrom Privacy Policy by describing your privacy rights if you are a California resident ("you") and including information on how to submit a request to exercise your rights.
It also describes our current practices for each of the topics addressed in the Notice, as well as our practices regarding personal information collected, used, disclosed, or "sold" as of the effective date of this Notice.

Request access to the specific pieces of personal information collected about you
Deletion.
Request deletion of your personal information
Disclosure.
Request disclosure of the categories of personal information we collect, the purposes for which we collect, sell or disclose that information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share the information
Opt Out.
Opt out of the "sale" of your personal information

In addition, we may offer certain discounts or rewards in connection with Nordy Club, our loyalty program, or other promotions we may offer from time to time in exchange for our use of your personal information that you provide.
Where we offer discounts or rewards in this manner, we will obtain your consent to our use of your personal information for this purpose.
Categories of Personal Information We Have Disclosed for a Business Purpose
We share personal information about you with service providers and third parties for business purposes, such as operational purposes and other purposes related to providing you with the products and services you seek from us.
We provide more information about the business purposes for which we disclose personal information in the “How We Share Information” section of our Privacy Policy.
We may share any of the categories of personal information listed in the “What Categories of Information We Collect” section of our Privacy Policy for business purposes.
Categories of Personal Information We Have “Sold”
We do not provide personal information about you to other companies for money.
We do share personal information with companies that we work with, including to help us market or advertise to you.
When this information is in a format that directly identifies you by name, it is generally not shared with any companies for third party marketing or advertising purposes.
You can find more details about our practices in our Privacy Policy, including in the “Online Advertising and Third Parties We Work With” section.
Even though we do not provide personal information to these companies for money, California law may characterize our providing the following categories of information we share with companies that provide services to you or to us, such as personalizing your experience with us or helping us to market or advertise our products and services to you, as “sales” of personal information:
Device and browsing information and other Internet activity information
Purchase or other commercial information
Demographic information
Identifiers and contact information
Inferences
Please see the “What Categories of Information We Collect” section of our Privacy Policy for further information about what these categories of personal information include.

Nordstrom does not knowingly “sell” the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

You must also adjust settings using each device and browser you use with this website, as well as adjust settings within each mobile application if you use any of our mobile apps.
Nordstrom may continue to collect and share personal information about you with third parties as described in our Privacy Policy if that sharing is not a “sale” of personal information, such as to continue to provide services to you.
