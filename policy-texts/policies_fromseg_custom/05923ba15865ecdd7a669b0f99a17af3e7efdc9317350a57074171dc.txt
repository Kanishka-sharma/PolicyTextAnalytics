Why Do We Collect and Use Information?
==========
Advertising supports free content and experiences we all love on the web, social media platforms, and on Internet-enabled mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to display content that may be of interest to you.
Relevant ads are less annoying and help the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads.
==========
What Types of Information Do We Collect and Use?
We may collect information such as your browser type (e.g., Firefox or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows), Internet provider (e.g., Verizon or Comcast), and whether you respond to an ad.
To provide relevant advertising for mobile users, we may also collect device type, make and model, operating system, carrier user ID, and information about the apps you use.
We may also use the location of your device if you have decided to provide it to one of DataXu’s publisher partners.
We do not collect information generally considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Social Security Number, credit card information, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, or health related information.
We collect IP address to provide more relevant content based on your region, which may be classified as PII in some jurisdictions.
==========
What Technology Do We Use to Collect Information?
We use two technologies to collect information, both of which are widely used on the Internet: cookies and pixel tags.
The information that we collect via our technologies is used for the purpose of targeting ads, measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of DataXu’s advertisers and to identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement.
This information also helps DataXu ensure that you don’t repeatedly see the same ad.
We may also use non-PII data from third parties.
==========
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that web sites place in your browser when you visit them or see an ad.
We use cookies to determine how often you’ve visited a site or seen an ad by assigning an anonymous identifier to your browser.
Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on your computer.
==========
Pixel Tags
Pixel tags are small, invisible images on a web page or other document.
Pixel tags allow the operator of the web page or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies.
Our pixel tags allow DataXu cookies to be set, read, and modified when you visit the websites of our partners.
Our pixel tags also allow our partners to better understand how you interact with their sites by observing which pages on their sites are visited.
==========
Opting Out
There are two ways you can opt-out of DataXu ad optimization.
Block all cookies by disabling cookie use in your browser.
This may cause some sites to work incorrectly.
Opt out by setting a cookie which tells the DataXu system to ignore you and not display targeted ads.
Please note that you will continue to see generic advertising.
==========
Click here to view your opt-out status
If you change computers, mobile devices or browsers, or use multiple computers, devices or browsers or delete your cookies, you will need to repeat this process for each computer or device and in each browser.
If you choose to opt out using our opt-out tool, DataXu will add a cookie to your browser identifying it as an opted out browser.
Once you have elected to opt-out our system may take up to twenty-four hours to refresh, but following the refresh this will prevent DataXu’s ad optimization system from collecting or using any behavioral data associated with your browser for targeted advertising.

Disclosures
Some of our web site partners may place their own cookies on your Internet browser outside of our service; however, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

==========

We may share the information we collect to do business with related, authorized third parties, such as our advertising clients.
