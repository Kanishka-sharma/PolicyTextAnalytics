How does retargeting JS Web Production works?
Our technology is intended to help our partners responsible for e-commerce sites by advertising their products to their customers.
==========
Our goal is to show you the most relevant ads possible so that they are interesting for you.
These advertisements are displayed in banner ads that can come in different forms.
==========
What information we collect ?
In order to show you advertisements that may interest you, we do not need to know who you are and we do not want to know.
==========
We simply know, thanks to an anonymous cookie deposited on the sites of our e-commerce partners, that you have visited their sites.
According to the e-commerce site, we can also know the products you have visited on these sites.
No personally identifiable information is recorded.
==========
You remain, in the eyes of our system, a simple numerical reference.
These different data that we collect in agreement with e-commerce sites are kept for a maximum of 30 days.
==========
How we use the information ?
These data that we collect anonymously are processed in their entirety by our statistical algorithms.
In this way, we are able to offer you in our advertisements the products you have consulted at our e-commerce partners, but also similar products or that correspond to your type of profile.
The data we collect is always in accordance with the e-commerce partner site.
==========
We do not collect any other information about you and do not share any of our data collected with third parties.
Sites that display our ads have no knowledge of the data we collect about you.
Only the e-commerce site and we are aware of them and use them to offer you the products most in line with your expectations.
==========
How to disable your re-targeted ads?
A page has been provided allowing you to indicate that you no longer wish to see customized banners by retargeting.
You can access it by clicking here.
==========
Be aware that our advertising agency also has a general advertising service.
You may be exposed to our ads again, but they will no longer be displayed based on your visits to e-commerce sites, they will be random.
