INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW WE USE IT       You always remain in control of the information you provide to Procter & Gamble.
We collect two types of information about visitors: Personal information (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information if you place an order with us, etc.) which you have voluntarily submitted to us, and Aggregate information (such as information about how many visitors log on to our sites, the pages they access, etc.).
==========
In general, you can visit our websites without telling us who you are or revealing personal information about yourself, although you may then not be able to participate in certain promotions or receive product information.
We collect, maintain and use personal information you have voluntarily submitted to contact you, including via email, to respond to your comments or requests for information, or to contact you if needed in the course of processing or shipping your order for products or services offered over our web sites.
In addition, we may use personal information to provide you the most helpful and targeted products and services to meet your needs and respond to your inquiries.
To better meet your needs, we may supplement the information we collect with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes.

If you do provide us with consent to share your information with other companies, we may share your information with companies who offer products and services that may be of interest to you.
These companies may then contact you directly with product or sample offers, personalized offers and information, or to ask for your feedback on products and programs that they think may be of interest to you.
Your personal information will generally be stored in the Procter & Gamble databases, which are located mainly in the United States or Europe.
Specific information is provided on the web site's consent or registration form, where needed.
For easier processing of e-mail campaigns or other marketing purposes, however, your personal information may be sent, usually on a temporary basis, to countries outside the United States or Europe.
