Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 20, 2021
Index Exchange, Inc. (“Index Exchange”) is committed to protecting and respecting user privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains the information collection, use, and disclosure practices of the following types of Index Exchange related data collection:

Corporate Website: when internet users visit our corporate website: indexexchange.com;
Index Exchange Services: when internet users visit a website, mobile app, or interact with a connected (smart) TV device (“CTV”) that uses Index Exchange service(s) (“Index Platform”)
Index Exchange Partners: when our partners interact with Index Exchange in the course of business activities (i.e. by registering to use the Index Platform, attending an Index Exchange event; or otherwise interacting with our services).
==========
THE INDEX EXCHANGE BUSINESS
Index Exchange is a global advertising marketplace where premium digital media companies transact ad impressions with accountability and in real-time.
Services offered by Index Exchange enable Publishers (owner of website/mobile app/CTV programming) to deliver ads to users.
Index Exchange connects Publishers to advertisers, agencies, demand side partners, including Demand Side Platforms (“DSP”) and Data Management Platforms (“DMPs”), identity partners, and ad networks (collectively, ‘IX Partners”) to efficiently market, buy, and sell digital, CTV, and mobile advertising.
The Index Platform provides advertisers with solutions to direct their campaigns to audience(s) they are looking to reach.
==========
INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING
In the course of business activities and while providing services to our Partners, Index Exchange may collect, receive, process or disclose user information that is considered personal information or personal data (“collectively, “PI”) under data privacy laws, including the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (collectively, “Data Privacy Laws”).
The information below outlines the PI that may be collected and processed by Index Exchange in connection with our services.
Please note, Index Exchange does not collect sensitive personal data as part of our services.
==========
The Index Exchange Website 
Index Exchange does not collect PI about internet users that visit our website.
Index Exchange may use certain types of strictly necessary cookies to enhance user experience on our website.
The information collected by these cookies, outlined below, is in the aggregate and anonymized to ensure it cannot track user browsing activity.
Strictly Necessary Cookies – these cookies are essential to enable users to navigate our website and use its features.
Analytical Cookies – these cookies collect information in the aggregate about how users interact with our website.
For example, these cookies help us understand how users arrive at our site, browse or use our site, and highlight areas where we can improve.
Functionality Cookies – these cookies remember choices users make, such as the country from which you visit our website, language, and search parameters such as size, color or product line.
==========
Index Exchange Platform 
Purpose of Processing PI:
To provide our services, the Index Platform may collect information that may be considered PI through Publishers that use our services.
For example, when users visit a website or mobile app, the Publisher sends the Index Platform a request to show users an ad.
To do this, Index Exchange may collect certain information about the ad space, the user, and the user’s device to help inform a Partner’s decision about serving the ad.
This information cannot directly identify a user (i.e. Index Exchange would not know a user’s name).
However, this information in limited circumstances is considered PI under Data Protection Laws.
==========
Index Exchange ultimately uses PI to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers of digital advertising inventory and, among other things, to enable Partners to effectively: (a) target advertisements to users of digital media properties, (b) evaluate and assess their advertisements and campaigns; and (c) view and enforce user opt-out choices.
Index Exchange’s platform further uses cookies to associate information that does not directly identify an individual user with browsers and devices, so that Index Exchange’s platform and Index Exchange clients/partners can then use the information to select advertisements and campaigns for delivery via the Index Exchange platform.
Index Exchange engages in cookie syncing, which is the matching of Index Exchange cookie IDs to Index Exchange clients’/partners’ cookie IDs.
==========
This allows us to provide more effective ways to deliver an ad to users.
Below is the PI Index Exchange may collect and/or process about you, along with information about how it is used.
This information may be shared with downstream Partners to be used for responding to requests for advertisements.
==========
Website and TV

Cookies(HTTP Cookies and HTML5 Cookies or Local Storage).
HTTP cookie.
This is an object that stores a small amount of data on behalf of a browser on a given device.
==========
By saving information in a cookie, websites can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.
Index Exchange uses both session-only and persistent cookies.
More specifically, Index Exchange uses certain cookies that last only for the duration of a user’s internet session and expire when that user closes his or her browser, as well as certain other cookies that are used to remember a user when he or she returns to a website and will last for longer.
HTML5 cookies, also known as HTML5 Web Storage, or local storage.
==========
This is a technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on a user’s computer or mobile device.
Index Exchange uses HTML5 cookies, or local storage, in connection with its platform and website to support publisher monetization objectives and speed up page load time.
Browser and device information.
This information is received from publishers and shared with advertisers and agencies for responding to requests for advertisements, forecasting advertising inventory and troubleshooting any operation issues related to the Index Platform;
IP addresses.
==========
This includes both IPv4 and IPv6;
Geo-location data (including GPS coordinates, where available);

 

Precise location data (data obtained from a device about the physical location of the device)
Unique Index Exchange Cookie IDs (“CMID”) – Index Exchange’s cookie identifier used to recognize a user;
Pixel Data (data obtained through or in connection with the placement of any pixel mechanism).
This is used as part of the user matching process;
People-based identifiers (“PID”).
These are third party identifiers that may be provided to Index Exchange by our partners.
PIDs are only collected if Publishers have permitted their use by Index Exchange.
==========
PIDs are associated to audience segment identifiers, and shared with advertisers and agencies to serve more relevant ads to users.
Index Exchange is unable to identify audience segments through the use of PIDs; these are simply passed through to downstream partners;

Mobile 
Index Exchange and our Partners use standard mobile advertising identifiers.
This includes the “IDFA” (advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices) and the “Google Advertising ID” (advertising identifier used on Android devices, to track your use of mobile apps on your device(s)).
==========
Index Exchange collects and stores IDs from a variety of domains, including adsrvr.org and casalemedia.com.
These IDs are stored in either Index Exchange’s domain (casalemedia.com) or the publisher’s first party domain.
In addition, although Index Exchange does not directly engage in Cross-App Advertising, our technology may collect and/or pass through Mobile Device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer) or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you, and this may be used by our downstream Partners to identify you.
==========
Lastly, Index Exchange, in limited circumstances, may send PI to our ad fraud vendors to ensure the integrity of the ads being served.
Partner Information During the Course of Business 
Registering to become a member of the Index Platform and use of the Index Exchange User Interface, either as an advertiser or a publisher, attending an Index Exchange sponsored event, and/or participating in a business relationship with Index Exchange requires the submission of PI Index Exchange (i.e. IX surveys).
==========
This can include the full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL.
Index Exchange uses this information to service its accounts and respond to inbound inquiries related to sales or technical support requests.
==========
Communications to business users are related to the Advertising Exchange.
The Index Exchange User Interface also uses Google Analytics technology to monitor traffic on the UI.
==========
All such information submitted is held by Index Exchange in strict confidence and as prescribed by corresponding regulatory authorities.
Index Exchange does not engage in any form of distribution or sale of PI to third parties for promotional use.
Index Exchange does not sell, supply, or otherwise make user PI available to any third party under any circumstances, unless ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction.
==========
Index Exchange will retain information only as necessary for legitimate business purposes.
If you wish for more information, or for Index Exchange to exercise your rights for the use of PI during the course of business, please contact us at privacy@indexexchange.com.
==========
Cross–Device Linking
Cross-Device Linking is the process of making assumptions that certain devices are related to each other, i.e. they belong to the same user/household.
Index Exchange does not engage in Cross Device Linking for ad delivery and reporting.

==========
In line with those values, we support efforts for self-regulation in the digital advertising industry.

==========
YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES
Web Browser Option to Opt–Out
Some of the ads you see on the internet or in applications on your mobile device are tailored to your interests and based on your activity online or in the applications on your mobile device.
This type of ad tailoring — sometimes called “interest-based” advertising — is enabled through various technologies, including browser cookies, mobile advertising identifiers as well as other non-cookie technologies.
Tailored digital ads help support the free products, services and content you enjoy online.
To help protect your privacy, Index Exchange (along with other NAI members) has voluntarily agreed to abide by high NAI standards including offering an opt-out mechanism.
==========
Opting out of interest-based advertising means that you will no longer be shown ads that have been tailored to your interests.
It does not mean you will no longer see advertising online.
==========
When you opt-out, an opt-out cookie will be stored in your web browser signaling your opt-out preference to NAI members including Index Exchange.
Please note that if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies, then the opt out cookie may not work.
If you delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again.
The opt-out will only apply to the specific browser in which you set it.
The opt-out process must be repeated for each different browser.
