Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Once IndiaMART receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure its security on its systems.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online-for example on message boards or through email -that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
