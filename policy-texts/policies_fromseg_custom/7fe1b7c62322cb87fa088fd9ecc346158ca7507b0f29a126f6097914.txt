Cookies are not the only way to store information on your computer or mobile device.
Matterport stores additional information that is essential to the functionality of the Services in local storage.
Local storage is similar to the storage of information in cookies, but never expires until our Services delete this information, or you delete it yourself.

Clear GIFs are small graphics files that contain an identifier that recognizes when a user visits our Websites.

This allows our third-party partners to monitor traffic patterns between websites, communicate with cookies, to understand if you have come from an advertisement displayed on a third party Website, to monitor the success of marketing campaigns and to improve site performance.
These technologies typically rely on cookies to function, so disabling cookies in your browser will impair their functionality.
