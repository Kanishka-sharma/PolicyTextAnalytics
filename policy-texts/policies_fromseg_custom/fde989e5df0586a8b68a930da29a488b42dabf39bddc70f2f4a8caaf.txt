"Camera Tracking" and "Microphone Tracking"
The Camera and Microphone Tracking feature is designed to detect the usage of camera and microphone (both built-in and external) by other applications on your device.
This feature will help you detect unauthorized intrusion into your private life by unknown applications.
When you activate this feature, it will notify you that some application started to use your camera and/or microphone.
You can allow your camera and microphone to be always used by applications that you believe are safe, so no notifications will be shown next time for these apps.
MacKeeper does not track and/or save any audio or video recordings, but it indicates the moment when the camera and/or microphone becomes activated by any application that is installed on your device.
==========
“Anti-Theft Service”
Anti-Theft is one of security features of MacKeeper™.
By default Anti-Theft is disabled.

You can report your computer STOLEN or LOST on your MacKeeper account, in open Anti-Theft tab.
Then it will collect IP address, track location, trace-route and make snapshots using the built-in iSight camera or any external camera every five minutes.
Automatically gathered data collected by the Anti-Theft service is completely anonymous.
