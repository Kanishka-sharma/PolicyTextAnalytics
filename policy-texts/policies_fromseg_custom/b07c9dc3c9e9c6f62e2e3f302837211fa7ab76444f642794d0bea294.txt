Searching in the dash
When you enter a search term into the dash Ubuntu will search your Ubuntu computer and will record the search terms locally.
Unless you have opted out (see the “Online Search” section below), we will also send your keystrokes as a search term to productsearch.ubuntu.com and selected third parties so that we may complement your search results with online search results from such third parties including: Facebook, Twitter, BBC and Amazon.
Canonical and these selected third parties will collect your search terms and use them to provide you with search results while using Ubuntu.
By searching in the dash you consent to:
the collection and use of your search terms and IP address in this way; and
the storage of your search terms and IP address by Canonical and such selected third parties (if applicable).
Canonical will only use your search terms and IP address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
For information on how our selected third parties may use your information, please see their privacy policies.
You may restrict your dash so that we don’t send searches to third parties and you don't receive online search results.
==========
To do this go to the Privacy panel and toggle the ‘Include online search results’ option to off.
The Privacy panel can be found in your System Settings or via a dash search.
For a current list of our selected third parties, please see the third party privacy policies.
