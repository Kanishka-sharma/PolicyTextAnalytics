Ability to stop transmission of SleepIQ Personal Information
You can choose to disable the transmission of Personal Information to us through SleepIQ by turning on “Privacy Mode” in the SleepIQ app.
This will stop the transmission of new Personal Information from SleepIQ while Privacy Mode is on.
The only information transmitted in Privacy Mode is that your pump is online and generally operational.
With Privacy Mode on, the SleepIQ app can still be used to control the Sleep Number® setting, the bed base, and other bed features; data needed to enable these features will be processed locally on your device and will not be transmitted to us.
Some features, such as obtaining Your SleepIQ® score, will not be available with Privacy Mode on.
