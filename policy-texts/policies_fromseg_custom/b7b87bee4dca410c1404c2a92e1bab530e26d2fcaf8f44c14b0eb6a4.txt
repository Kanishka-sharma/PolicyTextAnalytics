We collect your information only with your consent; we only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes.
Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!

What information DocHub collects and why
Automatically collected:
IP Address, user agent, and the referring URL.
When you visit our website we automatically receive your IP address and information such as the user-agent of your web browser.
This information is provided to us and every other website that you visit on the Internet by your web browser.
We collect this information for functional, security and analytical purposes.
User provided:
Contact information (name, email, phone number, job title, company name, payment information, avatar, and other information provided by the user) to access our platform and use our services.
==========
If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation.
Your account can be created with either a valid email and password or through (OAuth 2) authorization from a trusted service such as Google.
==========
Authorization from a trusted service will provide us with your email and basic profile information such as your name.
You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."
"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her.
Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”
User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information.
We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.
Why do we collect this?
==========
We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request.
We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on DocHub.
We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.
==========

Please see our section on email communication for more information.
We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement.
