To provide our Services, we must process some information about you, including Personal Information.

Your messages are stored on your own device.
If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it.
If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.
