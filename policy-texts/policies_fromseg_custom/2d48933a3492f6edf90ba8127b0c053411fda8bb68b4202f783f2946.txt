FOXBUSINESS.COM ("FOX") is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles (http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html)
applicable to all its U.S.-based companies.
FOX has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how
we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the
U.S., both online and off-line.
FOX is a general audience web site, and does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.
==========
From time to time FOX may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection
and use practices, the features of our web sites or technology.
If we make revisions that change the way we collect of use
your PII, those changes will be posted in the Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this
Privacy Policy.
Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.
==========
If FOX materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by
the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.
COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY FOX General.
FOX collects personally identifiable
information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) only
in order to create or enhance our relationship with you.
When we collect PII from you, it is because you voluntarily submit
the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription
registrations, chats or bulletin boards, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us or because you want us
to furnish you with products, services or information.
We may also obtain PII from third parties.
==========
Cookies.
Cookies are small bits of information that the FOX web sites place on the hard drive of your computer.
Cookies remember information about your activities on our site(s) and enable FOX to make your visits to our site(s) more enjoyable.
For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can save your preferences
for a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online store.
==========
Information about your activities on FOX sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used
to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.
Third party advertisements displayed on FOX's sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers.
FOX does not control these advertiser cookies and visitors to our web site(s) should check the privacy policy of the Internet
advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies (see "Notice" below for more information on third
party advertisements).
FOX may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web site(s) to PII obtained from you or a reputable third
party.
For example, if you've asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or
click stream data about your activities on FOX web sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think
you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
However, if FOX wishes to combine your personal
and cookie and click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.
You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, without
cookies you will not have access to certain features on FOX's web site(s), such as interactive "polling" and video player
settings.
==========
NOTICE: FOX Will Provide You with Notice About Its PII Collection Practices
When you voluntarily provide PII to FOX, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and
why the information is being collected and the types of uses FOX will make of the information.
At the time you provide your PII, FOX will notify you of your options regarding our use of PII, including whether we will
share it with outside companies (See ¿Choice¿ below).
This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to
send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information, provided
you have given FOX permission to do so (see "Use" below).
Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card
or subscription form.
Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be
provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from
us.
==========
FOX's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.
Some of these third party sites may be co-branded
with a FOX logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by FOX.
FOX's web site(s) also carry advertisements from
other companies.
FOX is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to
our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies.
Once you've left a FOX
site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party
or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.
FOX's web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with FOX (i.e., that are part of the News
America Group).
Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group's Privacy Principles (http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html),
visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in
some respects from this Policy.

companies such as DoubleClick and Revenue Science.
These companies ultilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements
and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our site(s), including information about the

CHOICE: FOX Will Provide You with Choices About the Use of Your PII
FOX will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted or share your
PII with third parties that are not affiliated with FOX (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your
permission.
USE: FOX's Use of PII
FOX will use your PII provided under this Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.
If FOX obtains PII from
a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy.
FOX may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is part of the News America Group of companies.
Provided you have given us permission, FOX may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated
with FOX, but would like to send you information about their products and services.
For example, some of the companies who
supply prizes for FOX's contests may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to FOX Networks viewers.
==========
However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is
collected.
Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those FOX uses to perform
tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make through FOX web sites.
FOX employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII.
FOX may share
your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration,
order fulfillment, statistical analyses) but they may only use your PII to provide FOX with a specific service and not for
any other purpose.
FOX may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows FOX to customize the
advertising and marketing messages you receive on our web sites.
==========
Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities
on our sites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished.
These companies will not share
your information with any third party or use it for any other purposes.
Anonymous click stream and demographic information
may also be shared with FOX's advertisers and business partners.
==========
There may be instances when FOX may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights
of FOX, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and
security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law
or legal process.
In addition, if FOX sell all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise
involved in a merger or business transfer, FOX may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.
SECURITY: FOX Protects the Security of PII
FOX uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against
loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.
In addition, FOX uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII
is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
Passwords and other sensitive information stored by FOX are encrypted
