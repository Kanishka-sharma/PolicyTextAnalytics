There are important distinctions between a telecommunications service and our service.
Our service is subject to different regulatory treatment than a telecommunications service.
This treatment may limit or otherwise affect your rights of redress before regulatory agencies.

If you subscribe to Business Plus, you are responsible for supplying, operating, and supporting the standard SIP based Customer Premise Equipment for use with the service.
As the subscriber and operator or administrator of this equipment, you are responsible for maintaining the security of the equipment, including but not limited to the physical and network security elements of your device.

We will provide a limited warranty on the device only for manufacturing defects for a period of 1 year from your subscription date.
Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
==========
(b)   Repair or replacement.

==========
DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
It is important that you read this entire section carefully.
This section provides for resolution of disputes through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
14.1   Arbitration.
==========
Vonage and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between you and Vonage.
Arbitration means that all disputes and claims will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of by a judge or jury in a court.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning under the law.
It includes, but is not limited to: disputes and claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Vonage, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; disputes and claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); disputes and claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement; disputes and claims that are currently the subject of individual litigation; disputes and claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and disputes and claims concerning the scope of this arbitration provision.
References to "Vonage," "us" and "you" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the service under this agreement or any prior agreements between you and Vonage.
14.2   Informal Resolution of Disputes.
==========
Our customer care department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer's satisfaction.
If you have a dispute or claim against us, you should first contact the Vonage customer care department by telephone at 1-VONAGE-HELP (1-866-243-4357) or by email at http://www.vonage.com/help_contactUs.php.
In the event your dispute or claim is not resolved to your satisfaction, you may seek to have that dispute or claim resolved as set forth below.
==========
14.3   Formal Notice of Disputes.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute.
(A)   A Notice of Dispute to Vonage must be sent to Vonage:
(1)   by certified mail addressed to: Vonage, Attn: Chief Legal Officer, 23 Main Street, Holmdel, New Jersey 07733; or
(2)   by email addressed to arbitration@vonage.com.
(B)   A Notice of Dispute to you must be sent to you
(1)   by certified mail at the last mailing address that you registered with Vonage; or
(2)   by email addressed to you at the last email address you registered with Vonage.
(C)   The Notice of Dispute must
(1)   describe the nature and basis of the dispute or claim; and
(2)   set forth the specific relief sought.
(D)   If you and Vonage do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or Vonage may commence an arbitration proceeding.
==========
You may download or copy a form to initiate an arbitration proceeding from the AAA website: http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=2062.
The amount of any settlement offer made by you or Vonage shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Vonage is entitled.
14.4   Arbitrator and Arbitral Rules.
The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
You may contact the AAA by telephone at 1-800-778-7879, by email at Websitemail@adr.org, or by mail at 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10, New York, New York 10017.
The arbitration shall be governed by the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
==========
14.5   Location and Procedure of Arbitration.
Unless you and Vonage mutually agree otherwise, all hearings conducted as part of the arbitration shall take place at a location, convenient to you, in the county or parish of your billing address.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you or Vonage may request that the arbitration be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim is in excess of $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
==========
14.6   Fees and Costs.
For claims under $10,000, Vonage will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, following the completion of the arbitration.
The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000, but is subject to change without notice by the AAA.
==========
If you are unable to pay the filing fee, Vonage will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you or the AAA.
Except as otherwise provided for herein, Vonage will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
If, however, the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous, then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Vonage for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
==========
14.7   Waiver of Jury Trial.
You and Vonage agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Vonage are waiving the right to a trial by jury.
14.8   Waiver of Class Actions.
==========
You and Vonage agree that the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
You and Vonage agree that you and Vonage may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
You and Vonage agree that, unless you and Vonage agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's or entity's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
==========
Despite §13.7 or any other provision in this agreement to the contrary, if this specific waiver of class actions provision, or any portion thereof, is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution and binding arbitration provision shall be null and void.
14.9   Statute of Limitations:
You must contact us within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute (except for billing disputes which are subject to section 9.5 of the agreement), or you waive the right to pursue a claim based upon such event, facts, or dispute.
14.10   Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement:
You and we agree:
(a)   you may take your dispute to small claims court, if your dispute qualifies for hearing by such court;
(b)   if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue in court claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due debt and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement;
(c)   you or we may take any disputes over the validity of any party's intellectual property rights to a court of competent jurisdiction;
(d)   any dispute related to or arising from allegations associated with fraudulent or unauthorized use, theft, or piracy of service may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction; and
(e)   either you or we may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Vonage, pending the completion of arbitration.
14.11   Modification of Arbitration Provision.
==========
Despite §15 or any other provision in this agreement to the contrary, if Vonage makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any such change and require Vonage to adhere to the language in this provision.

All device returns are subject to the return policy of the retail provider and are not eligible for our money back guarantee.
We will not accept any device returned to us from a retail customer.
(b)   Limited Warranty from Vonage for retail customers only.
We will provide a limited warranty on the device only for manufacturing defects for a period of 1 year from your subscription date.

Without limiting the generality of the warranty, it does not apply to any defect caused by damage in transit, retailer handling, or your handling of your device.
Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
For returns subject to this retail customer limited warranty, the following conditions must be satisfied:
we receive your device, in its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excluded, together with the original packaging, all parts, accessories, and documentation;
before returning your device to us, and within 1 year from your subscription date, you need to obtain a valid return authorization number from our Customer Care department which you can reach at 1-VONAGE-HELP; and [http://www.vonage.com/help_contactUs.php]

We will provide a limited warranty on the device only for manufacturing defects for a period of 1 year from your subscription date.
Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
==========
(b)   Repair or replacement.
Your only remedy for any breach of any limited warranty or other breach of any duty regarding a device is to get a repaired or replacement device by following our return procedures.
This limited warranty applies in place of the limited warranty included with the device if the included limited warranty is less favorable to you than this warranty.

==========
DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
It is important that you read this entire section carefully.
This section provides for resolution of disputes through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
14.1   Arbitration.
==========
Vonage and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between you and Vonage.
Arbitration means that all disputes and claims will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of by a judge or jury in a court.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning under the law.
It includes, but is not limited to: disputes and claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Vonage, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; disputes and claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); disputes and claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement; disputes and claims that are currently the subject of individual litigation; disputes and claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and disputes and claims concerning the scope of this arbitration provision.
References to "Vonage," "us" and "you" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the service under this agreement or any prior agreements between you and Vonage.
14.2   Informal Resolution of Disputes.
==========
Our customer care department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer's satisfaction.
If you have a dispute or claim against us, you should first contact the Vonage customer care department by telephone at 1-VONAGE-HELP (1-866-243-4357) or by email at http://www.vonage.com/help_contactUs.php.
In the event your dispute or claim is not resolved to your satisfaction, you may seek to have that dispute or claim resolved as set forth below.
==========
14.3   Formal Notice of Disputes.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute.
(A)   A Notice of Dispute to Vonage must be sent to Vonage:
(1)   by certified mail addressed to: Vonage, Attn: Chief Legal Officer, 23 Main Street, Holmdel, New Jersey 07733; or
(2)   by email addressed to arbitration@vonage.com.
(B)   A Notice of Dispute to you must be sent to you
(1)   by certified mail at the last mailing address that you registered with Vonage; or
(2)   by email addressed to you at the last email address you registered with Vonage.
(C)   The Notice of Dispute must
(1)   describe the nature and basis of the dispute or claim; and
(2)   set forth the specific relief sought.
(D)   If you and Vonage do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or Vonage may commence an arbitration proceeding.
==========
You may download or copy a form to initiate an arbitration proceeding from the AAA website: http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=2062.
The amount of any settlement offer made by you or Vonage shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Vonage is entitled.
14.4   Arbitrator and Arbitral Rules.
The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
You may contact the AAA by telephone at 1-800-778-7879, by email at Websitemail@adr.org, or by mail at 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10, New York, New York 10017.
The arbitration shall be governed by the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
==========
14.5   Location and Procedure of Arbitration.
Unless you and Vonage mutually agree otherwise, all hearings conducted as part of the arbitration shall take place at a location, convenient to you, in the county or parish of your billing address.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you or Vonage may request that the arbitration be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim is in excess of $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
==========
14.6   Fees and Costs.
For claims under $10,000, Vonage will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, following the completion of the arbitration.
The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000, but is subject to change without notice by the AAA.
==========
If you are unable to pay the filing fee, Vonage will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you or the AAA.
Except as otherwise provided for herein, Vonage will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
If, however, the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous, then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Vonage for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
==========
14.7   Waiver of Jury Trial.
You and Vonage agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Vonage are waiving the right to a trial by jury.
14.8   Waiver of Class Actions.
==========
You and Vonage agree that the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
You and Vonage agree that you and Vonage may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
You and Vonage agree that, unless you and Vonage agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's or entity's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
==========
Despite §13.7 or any other provision in this agreement to the contrary, if this specific waiver of class actions provision, or any portion thereof, is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution and binding arbitration provision shall be null and void.
14.9   Statute of Limitations:
You must contact us within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute (except for billing disputes which are subject to section 9.5 of the agreement), or you waive the right to pursue a claim based upon such event, facts, or dispute.
14.10   Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement:
You and we agree:
(a)   you may take your dispute to small claims court, if your dispute qualifies for hearing by such court;
(b)   if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue in court claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due debt and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement;
(c)   you or we may take any disputes over the validity of any party's intellectual property rights to a court of competent jurisdiction;
(d)   any dispute related to or arising from allegations associated with fraudulent or unauthorized use, theft, or piracy of service may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction; and
(e)   either you or we may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Vonage, pending the completion of arbitration.
14.11   Modification of Arbitration Provision.
==========
Despite §15 or any other provision in this agreement to the contrary, if Vonage makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any such change and require Vonage to adhere to the language in this provision.
