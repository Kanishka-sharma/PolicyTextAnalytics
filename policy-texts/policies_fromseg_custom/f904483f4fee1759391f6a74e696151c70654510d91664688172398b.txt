Courtesy.
At College Confidential, we expect discussion to be courteous even when disagreement may be vigorous.
When writing your messages, please use the same courtesy that you would show when speaking face-to-face with someone.
==========
Flames, insults, and personal attacks will not be tolerated.
It's fine to disagree with opinions, ideas, and facts, but always with respect for the other person.
Also, note that messages express the thoughts of the writers, not the community, its owners, staff, or moderators.
Visitors who post discourteous messages will be warned; repeat offenders will lose posting rights.
General Behavior.
==========
Our forum is expected to be a friendly and welcoming place, and one in which members can post without their motives, intelligence, or other personal characteristics being questioned by others.
Members who post in a manner that makes other members unwelcome or uncomfortable, or who conduct themselves in a manner in any way detrimental to the College Confidential community, will lose posting privileges.
Commercial Posts, Repetitive Posts, Spam.
Posts promoting web sites, products, or services are not allowed.
==========
Affiliate links and URL or promotional signatures are not allowed.
Please don't create extra work for our moderators by posting promotional notices on our boards.
If you register as a user, you can put your URL in your profile where interested visitors can find it.
We recognize that occasionally a post may contain a URL which could be of value to our visitors.
Users who post commercial messages will be warned or lose posting privileges.
Repetitive posts, numerous posts that do not comply with our TOS, solicitations by private message or email, and other egregious incidents of spam will be reported to the abuse department of the poster's Internet Service Provider and/or national spam tracking organizations.
==========
Politics, Religion, etc.
Politics, religion, and similar controversial topics should be discussed only as directly applicable to college matters.
College Confidential is not a debating society.
Hence, "Would a Catholic be comfortable at BYU?"
or "What is the political environment at Grinnell?"
are fine.
"Democrats (or Republicans) are evil!"
==========
and other opinions unrelated to the college process are not allowed.
Homework help posts are not allowed - please do your own work, and don't clutter the forums with requests for other members to do your work for you.
Please do not post e-mail addresses, as the forum has a mechanism for allowing member emails to be sent in a secure and private manner.
Embedded or hidden content in posts is not allowed.
==========
Repetitive and Inflammatory Topics.
Because of the high volume of posting and constant arrival of new members, we find that certain topics are raised over and over again as new discussions.
Some of these topics tend to produce repetitive debates that don't produce new arguments or insights, but lead to conflict and TOS violations by members.
==========
One example of such a topic is "affirmative action" when discussed in a "pro vs. con" sense.
Discussions of such repetitive topics may be closed, consolidated, or removed at the discretion of the moderators.
These same topics may be discussed in a variety of legitimate ways.
For example, a CC member may need to understand how affirmative action might apply to his/her chances, or how it is used in the admission process of a particular institution.
Such discussions are completely fine, though hijacking these discussions to turn them into broader debates is not.
==========
Word Filtering.
The forum will automatically filter certain words, including many swearwords as well as words, websites, and names that have been targeted by commercial promoters here.
Please do not attempt to "spell around" the filter.
If a term you are trying to use is in the filter, do not use it.
Deliberately evading our filter will cause loss of posting privileges.
==========
Copyrighted Material & E-mail Content.
Please do NOT post copyrighted material in our forum.
Examples of copyrighted material include articles from publications or websites, book excerpts, or any other content which you have not created yourself.
Fair use allows brief excerpts, e.g., a sentence or two, from copyrighted material for the purposes of review and commentary; please do not post massive excerpts from any source.
Also, for legal reasons, please do not quote the text of e-mail communications; such material may be paraphrased if appropriate (and if not privileged or confidential) but should not be reproduced in the forum.
==========
Links to Forums, Blogs, Social Network Pages, Photos, Videos, and Personal Sites.
Please do not post links to other discussion forums, blogs, personal sites, or other non-authoritative sources.
This includes Facebook, Myspace, and similar sites.
In order to fulfill our mission of being the best college discussion forum, we want important topics to be discussed here at College Confidential.
Linking to discussions elsewhere defeats this purpose.
Links to non-authoritative sites like blogs, personal sites, etc., can't be researched for validity on an individual basis and hence are not allowed.
All such links will be removed.
Similarly, please do not post email addresses or solicit private messages or email communications from other members.
While occasionally you may choose to contact an individual member via email or private message when the member accepts such messages, solicitation of such contacts in the forums is not permitted.
Given the heightened filtering of inappropriate contents on YouTube, we are removing our prohibition to links to that site on a trial basis.
Links to inappropriate photos, videos, etc. will always be prohibited.

Moderation.
CollegeConfidential.com moderators and administrators may edit, move, and delete posts to make them more accessible or to bring them into compliance with our TOS.
If an edit changes the context or meaning of the post in any significant way, moderators will usually include a note that the post has been edited in the post itself.
All moderation, however, is performed on a "best efforts" basis - each poster is fully responsible for his/her own posts, and each visitor is responsible for what he/she reads.
Offensive posts should be reported to the moderators, and every effort will be made to remove them as soon as possible.
Out of respect for both moderators and policies, discussion of moderator actions and forum policies is welcomed via private message or e-mail; these issues are off-topic for the forums.
==========
Language.
All posts will be in English.
Be descriptive, specific, and succinct in your postings.
This way your opinion and point is clearly understood and referenced.
Remember, people from all over the world read here with english as a second language.
Please avoid excessive abbreviation and "text messaging" shorthand.
Posts that do not meet our language guidelines will be deleted.
==========
Registration and Your Identity.
CollegeConfidential.com seeks to maximize the utility of its forum to its members and visitors, and does not knowingly allow members to misrepresent themselves.
Multiple registrations by the same individual without written permission from CollegeConfidential.com are not allowed.
Re-registration by individuals who have been banned or denied posting privileges in the past is not allowed.
Individuals who misrepresent themselves (e.g., posing as a student or parent when they are not, claiming a false affiliation with a college, etc.), or who register with multiple identities, or who re-register after having been banned, will be reported to the abuse department of their internet and/or email service provider and may be subject to civil or criminal action depending on the nature of their violation.
==========
College Professionals.
Some of our members are be admissions officials, administrators, or faculty at a college or university.
Occasionally, a member may falsely claim to hold such a position.
To protect our student and parent members, there are two ways that a higher education professional can post.
==========
First, that member can contact the forum administrator and present independently verifiable information as to personal identity and school; that individual can then receive "College Rep" status, which indicates that CC has taken reasonable steps to verify the individual is from the claimed school.
The school must be identified publicly, although the individual's personal info will not be disclosed.
Second, if an individual prefers to remain anonymous, he or she will refrain from making claims (even if true) as to current position.
E.g., "I'm an admissions officer at a selective liberal arts college" would not be permitted.
==========
Such members will still develop a reputation for expertise, of course, if their body of posts demonstrates their knowledge.
CC members are advised NOT to publicly question the credentials of a new member claiming a university affiliation.
Rather, they should call the post to the attention of the moderators or the administrator so that CC policy may be explained and any necessary verification take place.
==========
