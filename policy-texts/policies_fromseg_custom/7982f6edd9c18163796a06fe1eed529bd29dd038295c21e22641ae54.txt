The policy of the University is to respect the privacy of all web site visitors to the extent permitted by law.
Although all University web sites are encouraged to do so, the following web sites must select, adhere to and notify visitors of their information collection policy by including a "Privacy Statement" on their website.
Official University sites
All sites that collect online information from visitors
All sites that track user actions
Units and individuals responsible for web sites may select the standard or customized "Privacy Statements" included within this policy, or they may create one of their own.
Any such statement must be written to assure web site users that the University will:
Inform visitors about information collected, its intended use, and options for using the site without providing such information.
==========
Follow laws governing the collection of online information.
Notify visitors of their options concerning accessing information collected.
Establish appropriate security measures for any personally identifiable information collected.
==========
Notification of visitors requires that each page of the web site display a link to a "Privacy Statement", display the statement itself, or cause the statement to be displayed the first time a user visits the site, and each time the statement changes thereafter.
The privacy statement should include a reference and link to this University policy and contact information for visitors with questions about the specific site policy, data collection, or data security.
Official University web sites, sites that collect information from visitors online, and those that track user actions must post an online privacy statement by September 2001.
Use by other University web pages not included in the three subcategories above is encouraged.
==========
Sites conducting web-based research are subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).
The IRB will develop its own guidelines for the use of web sites in research and will apply those guidelines to research projects requiring IRB review.
Exclusions
This policy does not address issues related to internal security measures of electronic communication or those related to conducting research activities on the WWW.
Special Situations
If private information (Defined by the Minnesota Data Practices Act) is requested from individuals, they must be informed of certain information that is collected.
(Minn.
==========
Stat.
13.04 subd.
2)
As an ever-increasing number of users interact with the University and its units through web sites, technology provides increasing opportunities to gather information about these individuals.
While much information-gathering is consensual and for specific purposes, web users are discovering that some web sites gather information without the users' knowledge or consent.
This information may be used for purposes contrary to the users' interests, and over time this process may erode users' confidence in using the web.
==========
The University is committed to informing online users of the data collection and storage policies of its sites as it fulfills its primary mission of teaching, research and outreach.
This policy establishes standards for informing users whether and when the University collects information electronically via the WWW.
The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act - Minn.
Stat.
13.01 et seq. governs the classification and distribution of public and private information collected by public organizations.
==========
By amendment in 2003, the Data Practices Act also requires that websites maintained by public entities display privacy notices to visitors, and establishes specific language that must be included in the notices.
Customized versions of privacy statements may be necessary to meet the specialized needs of groups within the University such as students, health sciences or business units.

Cookies
Cookies are data that a web site transfers to an individual's browser where they are stored and later returned to the site upon request.
They allow sites to identify users within and across visits, to track usage patterns, and to more easily compile data on transactional information for individuals visiting web sites.

Any means of identifying an individual, manual or automated.
A process that enables recognition of an entity by an automated information system is usually accomplished through the use of unique machine-readable user names.

Often these are pages directly linked to the main web page for the campus, listed in the directory of departments and units, or displaying the University of Minnesota wordmark.
This includes sites used primarily by the University for administrative purposes.
Online Information Collected From Visitors
Any data typed into a web page by a visitor and collected and stored by the web site.
For example the web page may have prompts for this information such as "enter your name" or input boxes.
This definition does not include routine e-mail links to send comments for site improvement to the webmaster.
Personally Identifiable
Data or information that include (1) the name of the person or other family members; (2) the person's address; (3) a personal identifier such as a Social Security number, student ID number, e-mail address, telephone number, or other user number (4) a list of personal characteristics, or (5) other information that would make the person's identity easily traceable.
