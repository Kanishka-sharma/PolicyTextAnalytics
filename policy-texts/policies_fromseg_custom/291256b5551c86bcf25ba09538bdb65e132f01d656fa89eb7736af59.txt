(Version 8.0)
When you write a review on Trustpilot or otherwise use our Website, we collect and process personal data about you.
This document helps you understand what personal data we collect about you, how we collect it, what we use it for, and what rights you have regarding your personal data.
When we talk about “Trustpilot,” “we,” “us” or “our,” we mean Trustpilot, Inc., 245 5th Avenue, 4th floor, New York, NY 10016, USA.
We also use “Policy” to refer to this Privacy Policy and “Website” to refer to our applications and all of Trustpilot’s websites through or in connection with which you are accessing this Policy.
==========
When you create a profile or write your first review on the Website, we will automatically generate a personal account for you on Trustpilot (“Account”) and collect the following personal data about you (the “Master Data”):
Your username (this will be public),
Your securely encrypted password,
Your email address, and
Your location and country (your country will be public)
This information is mandatory, which means that it will not be possible to write a review on the Website without it.
You can choose to add further personal data to your profile.
The additional data you can add is your name, a profile description, photo, gender, city and language.
This additional information will be public.
Trustpilot is an open review platform and when we display your review we will connect it to your profile so that people can see who wrote the review and the number of reviews you have written.
Therefore, please be aware that depending on the information you add to your profile and the username you choose, you may or may not be anonymous.
==========
When you write a review about a company, we collect the information you put in your review.
This includes:
Which company you review
The type of buying or service experience your review concerns (see the definition of “Service Experience” in our User Guidelines)
The headline and content of your review
The location of your Service Experience
Your rating of your Service Experience with the company (1-5 stars)
Your rating of the Product (1-5 stars)
The date of your review and, if you update your review, the date on which it is edited
A reference number or order ID (if you or the company provides one)
If we ask you to provide information or documentation verifying your Service Experience and you send us such documentation, we will collect and process the documentation for the purpose(s) stated in the request.
Please don’t share any sensitive personal documents or information with us, either concerning yourself or others.
==========
When you write a review on our Website, people can show that they find your review useful, for example by “liking it”, and we collect this information.
We also collect information about how many people read your review.
We don’t track the identities of people who aren’t logged in and read the reviews, but we do collect data on the number of consumers who read your review.
==========
If you “like” another person’s review we will also collect that information.
If you notify us about a review that you believe violates our User Guidelines, then we collect the information you provide in your notification to us.
This can include which review you notified us about, the reason for your notification, the date of your notification, etc.
==========
You can connect your Trustpilot profile with your profile on social networks, e.g. Facebook (“Social Network(s)”).
When you use this option we automatically collect selected information about you from your Social Networks.
The information we collect depends on what information you have made available on those Social Networks and your privacy settings for sharing such information on the Social Networks.
Depending on your settings and selection, we will collect the following information from your Social Networks:
Name and/or username
Email address
Profile photo
Who your social connections are
When you make a request to connect your Trustpilot profile with a Social Network profile, you will be informed about which information we will collect from the Social Network in question.
You will receive this information before your request is carried out.
==========
You can choose to disconnect your Social Network profile from your Trustpilot profile via your Account.
At this point, Trustpilot will remove your Social Network unique ID, and disconnect/revoke Trustpilot from your Social Network.
Your profile picture from your Social Network profile will remain on your Trustpilot profile.

Pursue legitimate business interests of our own related to operating the Website and providing our services to you, or to pursue the legitimate interests of third parties as long as your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
For the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, where necessary.
==========
Some of these grounds for processing your personal data overlap, so there may be several reasons which justify us processing your personal data.
In those limited circumstances where you have expressly given your consent to us to process your personal data, for example, when subscribing to our newsletters, you are free to revoke your consent at any time.
However, please be aware that we may have the right to continue to process your information if it can be justified on one of the other legal bases mentioned above.
You have the right to object to how we process your personal data, or ask us to restrict the processing.
Please see below, at 12, for more details.
If you would like more information about our legal basis for processing your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) - see 14, below.
==========
We are an open review platform and we share your review on our Website so that others can read about your experience with a specific company.
When you write a review, we will disclose your review, the number of reviews you have written, your username, your location (country) and other information you have chosen to connect with your public profile.
Remember that if you have selected to use your name as your username, this can reveal your identity in full or in part - unless you use a pseudonym.
==========
We recommend that you exercise care in deciding which information to make available for disclosing on the Website, and be aware that depending on the level of information provided, you may or may not be anonymous.
Master Data and other information
When you write a review on our Website and create an Account, your username, review, location (country) , the number of reviews you have written and other additional information you have chosen to connect with your public profile will be visible on the Website.
The companies you review can also receive information about your review.
==========
Geo-location
When you write a review on the Website, we use your computer’s IP address (see 1.7 of this Policy, above) to approximate your location to the nearest country.
This information is made available to other users of the Website.
Reviews you found useful
When you find other reviews useful (by “liking” them), other users of our Website can see the review(s) you “liked”.
==========
Social Networks
If you connect to a Social Network, information such as your profile photo, your name, birth year and approximate location will be collected from your Social Network profile and used to identify you on the Website.
Subject to your privacy settings and the level of information available from the Social Network, users of the Website can use this information to identify which reviews you have written.
If you have chosen to preserve anonymity by using a pseudonym for your Trustpilot username, be aware that information from Social Network(s) can reveal your identity in part or in full and make it possible to identify which reviews you have written.
If your contacts or friends (referred to as “Connections”) on the Social Network have also connected with Trustpilot, we display on the Website how you are connected to these Connections through the Social Network.
This is only visible to you.
==========
Other people on Trustpilot cannot see your Connections from Social Networks.
If you choose to connect your Trustpilot profile with your profile on a Social Network, information and reviews provided by you on the Website or data compiled by us about your use of the service on the Website (e.g. the number of reviews you have written) will be shared with and displayed in connection with your profile on the Social Network and will be subject to the privacy policy of the Social Network.
One of Trustpilot's main goals is to increase the exposure and availability of reviews on the Website.
We therefore permit other services to show reviews created on the Website.
This increases the potential audience for your reviews.
==========
The categories of third party services and companies who can show your review(s) together with your public user profile are:
Search engines, including Google and Bing
Companies reviewed on Trustpilot
Companies that have invited you to review a Product
Consumer portals and business portals, including price comparison websites, shopping guides, etc.
Application partners and platforms, such as Prestashop, Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce
Other similar websites where, in Trustpilot’s assessment, it will be relevant for users to search for reviews.

Once you submit your review, it is published on the Website.
This means that the following information is disclosed:
Your review(s), (see 1.2, above)
Your username, location (country) and the additional data you choose to add to your profile, such as your name, a profile description, photo, gender, city and language.
If you write a review on Trustpilot in response to an invitation sent by a company via our review invitation services, the company who sent you the invite will be able to link your review with the invitation.
==========
If we need to verify your review, we will contact you and ask for documentation that shows that you have had a buying or service experience with the company you reviewed.
We therefore recommend that you keep such documentation for 12 months from the date of your review.
We explain the type of documentation you should send us here.
We do not share the documentation you send to us with the reviewed company.
However, if you have a reference number or order ID, we may pass that on to the company, unless you ask us not to.
