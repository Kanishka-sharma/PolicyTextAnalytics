4.1 Cookies and Similar Technologies
We and our third-party service providers may use cookies and similar technologies on our website and mobile applications to improve user experience, for performance and analytics, and to improve our content, products, and services.
We also use cookies and similar technologies for purposes of marketing and advertising, including interest-based advertising.
For more information on interest-based advertising, see the “Interest-Based Advertising” section.
==========
Certain information may be stored or accessed using tracking technologies such as “cookies” and “web beacons” that may be downloaded to your Device when you visit or interact with our websites and mobile applications.
This information may include, but is not limited to:
IP address, UDID or other unique device identifier, a number that is automatically assigned to your Device and used by us to identify your Device;
Device functionality and characteristics (including browser, operating system, hardware, and mobile network information);
The URL that referred you to our website;
The areas within our website or mobile application that you visit and your activities, including remembering your preferences; and
Device location.
A “cookie” is a small text file that a web server stores in browser software.
A browser sends cookies to a server when the browser makes a connection to the server (for example, when requesting a web page from the same domain that created the cookie).
The purpose of cookies is to remember the browser over time and distinguish one browser instance (or user) from all others.
We use both HTML cookies and Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as Flash cookies) that are built for use with the Adobe® Flash® Player for authentication purposes and to enhance navigation and website functionality.
==========
Cookies can remember login information, preferences, and similar information.
If you access your account online, cookies may be used to verify your identity, to authenticate you as a user on our system and to personalize aspects of your experience on our website.
We also use cookies to let us know how our customers and other visitors are using our website so that we can optimize their experience.
We permit certain third party advertising providers to set cookies and use related technology such as web beacons or “clear GIFs” through our website and other websites on which we advertise, and via HTML email messages, to track performance of advertisements and to collect aggregate data on web page viewing.
Some cookies and other technologies may serve to track personal information previously entered by a web user on the site.
We may also use web beacons or “pixels,” and in certain circumstances may collect IP address, screen resolution and browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, dates and times that our site is accessed, and other categories of data.
==========
Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether to accept them and how to remove them.
You can manually delete HTML cookies and set most browsers to refuse to accept HTML cookies.
For information on how to disable cookies, refer to your browser’s documentation.
Flash cookies may be removed by managing your Adobe® Flash® Player settings.
To delete or prevent placement of Flash cookies, visit the Adobe® Flash® Player Help site at www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager, click on the hyperlink for "Website Privacy Settings Panel" on the left side of the screen, and follow the instructions for preventing third party Flash content from storing data on your computer.

4.2 Interest-Based Advertising
We use "interest-based" ads, also known as “online behavioral advertising."
Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or apps.
You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads.
We may partner with ad networks and other advertising providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites.
Some of these third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or online services to deliver advertising based on your interests and preferences, as inferred from your browsing history.
Some of these ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information that E*TRADE and its Advertising Providers collect about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time.
==========
To learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising, you may either visit www.aboutads.info to opt-out of sites and services participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program, or visit www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ to opt-out of this form of advertising by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”).
Note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications, although it may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
In addition, if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
==========
4.3 Do Not Track
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative.
Our websites do not alter their behavior when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from browser software.
Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other similar mechanisms.
