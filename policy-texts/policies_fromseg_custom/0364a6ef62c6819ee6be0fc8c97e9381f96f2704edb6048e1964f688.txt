Navegg not only cares about Internet privacy, but also defends it.
Every analysis we make is anonymous and no identifiable personal data – that is, information that could reveal the identity of the person analyzed – is collected or distributed.
Our system analyzes the content visited by the user only in order to make sociodemographic inferences (purchase intent, gender, age etc.).
The browsing history of the user is not stored or redistributed – all information collected is summarized and analyzed in that way only.

We work with editors of many kinds of contents so that users have a richer browsing experience, through relevant and non-intrusive advertising and personalized content.
The editors’ privacy policy must mention that third-party cookies are being used to collect information that may be used to direct advertising or content in a personalized way.
