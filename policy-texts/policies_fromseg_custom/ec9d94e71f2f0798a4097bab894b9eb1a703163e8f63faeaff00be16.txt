We may also collect information about the pages you view within our sites and other actions you take while visiting us.
In addition, we may also use such technologies to determine whether you’ve opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail.

Certain online transactions may involve you calling us or us calling you.
They may also involve online chats.

Use of Information in the Social Computing Environment
IBM provides social computing tools on some of its Web sites to enable online sharing and collaboration among members who have registered to use them.
==========
These include forums, wikis, blogs and other social media platforms.
When registering to use these tools, you will be asked to provide certain personal information.
Registration information that is not automatically made available to other participants as part of your profile will be subject to and protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
Any other content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any other type of personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is not subject to this Privacy Statement.

Information for Business Partners
If you represent an IBM business partner, you may visit IBM Web sites intended specifically for IBM business partners.
We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the business partner you represent, and IBM business partners generally.
==========
For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of IBM business partner programs.
It may also include sharing certain information with other business partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or IBM customers or prospects.

Sharing of Personal Information and International Transfers
IBM is a global organization with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders.
As such, we may share information about you within IBM and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world.
==========
This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, IBM will still handle your information in the manner described here.
In some cases, IBM uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information on its behalf.
It is IBM's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with IBM's policies.
From time to time, we may disclose information that identifies you at an individual level and which we collected on our Web sites to other non-IBM entities that are not acting as our suppliers, such as our business partners.
Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we will only do so with your prior consent.
We do not sell or lease such information however.
==========
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, IBM decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries.
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers.
It is IBM’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
==========
Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.

Information Security and Accuracy
We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its accuracy.
IBM implements reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.
For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information such as credit card information when we transmit such information over the Internet.
We also require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.
==========
Retention
We will retain your registration information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
If you wish to request that we no longer use your registration information to provide you services contact us at NETSUPP@us.ibm.com.
We will retain and use your registration information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies
As mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our Web sites to help us gather statistics about our Web sites usage and effectiveness, personalize your experience on our sites, and tailor our interactions with you.
We do so through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies".
A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer.
While cookies are often only used to measure Web site usage and effectiveness and to allow for ease of navigation or use and as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor’s experience to a Web site by being associated with profile information or user preferences.
==========
You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not.
You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies.
Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web sites’ features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able, for instance, to add items to your shopping cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Web site services that require you to sign in.
==========
Some IBM Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service.
These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across IBM's Web sites.
When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers.
These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.
If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.
If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages; however, they will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies.
==========
We may also include Web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.
Some of our business partners set Web beacons and cookies on our site.
In addition third-party social media buttons may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring Web site addresses, and, if you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link such collected information with your profile information on that site.
==========
We do not control these third party tracking technologies.
Note that the "s81c.com" domain used to deliver static content on some of our Web sites is managed by IBM, and not by a third party.

Online Advertising
IBM does not deliver third party online advertisements on our Web sites but we advertise our products and services on others’ Web sites.
We may collaborate with Web site operators as well as network advertisers to do so.
Please familiarize yourself with those Web site operators' or network advertisers' privacy policies to understand their practices relating to advertising, including what type of information they may collect about your Internet usage.
IBM does not provide any information relating to your usage of IBM Web sites to Web site operators or network advertisers.
Some advertising networks we may use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).

We may also provide you with general links to non-IBM Web sites.
Your use of these links and applications is subject to the third parties’ privacy policies, and you should become familiar with the third party sites' privacy policies before using the links or applications.
