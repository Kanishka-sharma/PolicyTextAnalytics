We, as well as our service providers, may advertise our products and services through online services offered by us, our affiliates and third parties that are not affiliated with us, including:
Prescreened offers of credit;
Ads based upon your location (e.g., IP address), your computer(s) and mobile device(s), your browsing habits on online services offered by us or our affiliates, your relationship or transactions with us if you are a customer (e.g., contact information, and your holdings, transactions, demographics and location) and other information described above; and
Ads based upon the above information and your browsing habits on online services offered by non-affiliated third parties ("online behavioral advertising" or "OBA").
If you click on one of our ads, a cookie may be stored on your computer or device and later used to display tailored ads for our products or services.
OBA Opt-Out: We subscribe to the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, which promote consumer awareness and choice about how their information is used for OBA.
==========
We do not respond to "do not track" signals transmitted by web browsers or similar mechanisms.
However, you may opt out of the use of information about your browsing habits for OBA ads through opt-out mechanisms provided through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"):
Ads based on your web browsing habits: Click the AdChoices icon on the ad and follow the instructions, or visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices; and
Ads based on your app browsing habits: Download the DAA's AppChoices app through the app store on your mobile device (as available).
Opting out of OBA ads may not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or apps, but it will likely make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
If you erase cookies from your browser, use a different browser, or reset the ad identifier on your device, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
In addition, we may still collect data in browsers and apps for non-OBA purposes such as market research, reporting and development of our products and services.
