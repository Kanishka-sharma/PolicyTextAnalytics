What we do
How does MoneyGram protect my personal information?
To help protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we endeavor to use reasonable security measures.
These measures can include physical, electronic and procedural safeguards such as computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
We also endeavor to limit personal information access to only employees, agents and representatives who need to know.
==========
Despite our efforts, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your transmissions to us or may wrongly instruct you to disclose information to them by posing as MoneyGram or by misinforming you about our services.
How does MoneyGram collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
send or receive money, complete a payment or use or request other products or services from us
provide account information or otherwise give us your contact information
show your government issued ID
use our online sites (for example, to complete a transaction, manage your accounts, or provide your choices) or click on our online ads on other sites

We also collect your personal information from a variety of sources, including without limitation, computer systems; third party sources such as our business clients, government agencies and other suppliers of information; and consumer reporting agencies – all in compliance with and subject to the limitations of applicable law.
==========
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
For details, see the “To limit our sharing” section, and see below for more on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
