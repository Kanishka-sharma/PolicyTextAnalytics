Accessing or Rectifying Your Information
You have the right to obtain from us free information about your personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information.
If the information we hold about you is inaccurate or not complete, you have the   right to ask us to rectify it.
If that data has been passed to a third party with your consent or for legal reasons, then we must also ask them to rectify the data.
Erasing Your Information
We shall process and store your personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by applicable laws or regulations to which we are subject to.
You have the right to request the erasure of your information.
This is sometimes called ‘the right to be forgotten’.
==========
You have the right to the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay,   and we shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay when:

The original purpose for the personal data is no longer necessary or the data itself is no longer necessary for the purpose
When you no longer consent.
If you object to your data being processed and there is no legitimate reason to override this objection.
If the data being processed relates to the offer of information society services to a child.
If the data is ever processed in breach of data protection regulations (i.e. GDPR).
There is a legal obligation to erase the data.
If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and you wish to request the erasure of personal data stored by us, you may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or the controller who shall promptly ensure   that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps,   including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that you have requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not   required.
==========
Object, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent
You have the right to ask us to restrict how we process your data.
This means we are permitted to store the data but not further process it.
We keep just enough data to make sure we respect your request in the   future.
It is your right to lodge an objection to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time, to the processing of personal data concerning you.
==========
This also applies to   profiling.
We shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the   establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
If we process personal data for direct marketing purposes, you shall have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing.
This applies to profiling to the   extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
If you object to us to the processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.
In addition, you have the right, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to object to the processing of personal data concerning you by us for scientific or historical research purposes, or for   statistical purposes, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
==========
If you have given us your consent to process your data but change your mind later, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, and we must stop processing your data.
Data Portability
We must allow you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across services in a safe and secure way without this effecting the usability of your data.
In exercising your right to data   portability, you shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
Automated Individual Decision-Making
You shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you, or similarly significantly affects you, as long as   the decision (1) is not necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and a data controller, or (2) is not authorized by law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to   safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on your explicit consent.
If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and a data controller, or (2) it is based on your explicit consent, we shall implement suitable measures to   safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your point of view and contest the decision.
