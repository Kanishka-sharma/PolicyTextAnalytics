==========
How do you use tagging, cookies, and other identifiers to collect information?
As part of ScorecardResearch’s market research effort, participants agree to deploy ScorecardResearch web tags throughout their site.
These tags send a message to ScorecardResearch that causes a ScorecardResearch cookie to be dropped or a mobile identifier to be accessed.
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive (see “cookie” section below).
This process, which we refer to below as “browser-level measuring,” is done so that ScorecardResearch is able to identify browser-level behavior such as new versus repeat visitors to a website or page.
==========
ScorecardResearch uses the combination of tagging,cookies, and mobile identifiers (where relevant) to help participants count users who have visited and seen a page or various parts of a page.
We require that any website using our tagging and cookies include a notice about the use of tagging and cookies to collect anonymous traffic data and to state what choices are available to users regarding the use of the information collected.
In certain instances where ScorecardResearch is being used to measure an advertisement, the cookie may be set by an advertising network or advertiser.
If this advertising network or advertiser is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance, notice may be provided by clicking on the DAA icon.
Please note that you can view and deleted these cookies using the features of your browser or by installing a third party tool to view the cookies.
==========
ScorecardResearch may use a third party service provider to obtain non-personally identifiable information and add that data to our measurements.
Either ScorecardResearch or the third party service provider may initiate the process which results in this association, and this process may involve ScorecardResearch triggering the dropping of a cookie belonging to the third party service provider.
We may also associate the anonymous unique identifier within the ScorecardResearch cookie on your computer or device with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies) using confidential matching procedures.
==========
What information, including personal information, is collected?
The ScorecardResearch tagging is not used to identify the user visiting a page.
As an example, our tags may collect such data as a timestamp, the URL, and the title of the web page.
==========
How is the information used and disclosed?
This information is analyzed and the resulting reports, research and information products are shared with our clients.
These reports help our clients meet their business goals by providing them with a better understanding of internet behavior, trends and consumer preferences.
How long do you retain the information you collect?
==========
The data collected through browser-level measurement is typically maintained for up to 90 days.
Such data may be aggregated and used for analytical purposes indefinitely.
Additionally, in certain circumstances, for instance when a specific site has asked for detailed reporting, selected anonymous records relating to that specific site may be maintained indefinitely.
==========
How do I opt out?
You can control your level of participation in ScorecardResearch’s market research programs, along with other research programs that are operated by Full Circle Studies, Inc., or its affiliates.
To opt-out of having ScorecardResearch’s market research programs associated with your browser, please click here .
We will continue to count the fact that a browser came to a site, but that count will not be associated with your browser.
This opt-out will also prevent you from receiving invitations to participate in market research surveys from ScorecardResearch or VoiceFive, Inc. (an affiliate of Full Circle Studies, Inc., that offers surveys across the Internet).
==========
However, it is important that you understand that this opt-out is cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted-out).
So, if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective.
Additionally, because different computers and different Internet browsers all require their own version of the opt-out cookie, you need to perform this opt-out process on any computers and browsers that you want to be opted-out.
==========
How will I be notified of changes to this Agreement?
If we change our practices in how we handle the data we collect, or if we change other aspects of our program, we will post these changes on this  website, and the changes will be effective immediately upon such posting.
If you do not agree with any of the changes, you may opt out of data collection as described above.
