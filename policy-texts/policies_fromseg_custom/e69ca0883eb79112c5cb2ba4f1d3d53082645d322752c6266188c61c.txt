Collection and Use of Information and Content
When you visit Wix you provide us with two types of information: limited personal information and content you knowingly choose to disclose and/or post on the Wix website.
When you register with Wix, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name and contact information.
In addition, when you use Wix, we may collect information about your use of the website in order to provide and improve our Services.
==========
For example, we or our third party utility-tracking partners may collect your browser type and IP address through log files.
This information is gathered for all Wix visitors.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
In addition, we or our third party partners may collect and store certain information from your browser using "cookies."
A cookie is a piece of data (a small file, with typical content of letters and numbers) stored or downloaded on a user's computer or other device that can be tied to information about the browser’s activities on our website.
Our cookies allow us to provide certain features of Wix.
==========
For example, among other things, we use cookies to keep track of your preferences, conduct support and debugging, understand the duration of user’s session, authenticated session for our Answers system, save from which country users are using the Website, including for E-commerce applications and mobile editors, and to estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.
Wix also uses cookies to improve the content and services it provides to its users.
By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID and password to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Wix.
If you want to delete or block any cookies, please refer to the help and support area  on your internet browser for instructions on how to locate the file or directory that stores cookies.
.
Information on deleting or controlling cookies is also available at www.AboutCookie.org.
Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our Website.
==========
We or our third party advertising partners may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us improve our site, for example to better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information if you choose to provide such information to us.
==========
We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.
Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, also use Flash cookies to collect and store information.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data, and how data is stored.
Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
To learn about privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies that may be available, you can click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118.  Please note that Wix does not provide this information and is not responsible for its accuracy.
Our third-party partners may have their own policies regarding how they collect and store information through the technologies discussed above.
Specifically, the use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy and we do not have access or control over these cookies.
