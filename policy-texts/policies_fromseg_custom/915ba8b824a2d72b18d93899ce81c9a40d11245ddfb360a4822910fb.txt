Changes to This Policy 
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically for any changes.

==========
Information We Collect
Simplifi provides its online Advertising Services to Advertising Customers through site retargeting, search retargeting, contextual retargeting, Facebook API, and location-based services including (“GeoFencing”) of Internet users.
These services are generally provided through third-party websites owned and/or operated by our Advertising Customers who publish their own content on the Internet.
We may receive Personal Information such as physical addresses from our Advertising Customers, which we de-identify and use for GeoFencing and to provide analytical reports to our Advertising Customers.
==========
We may also obtain information from third-party data providers, such as physical addresses (including precise geo-location data), information about physical locations of a device over time, and information about consumer characteristics such as demographics and predicted interests.
Through our Advertising Services, we collect information about users’ online activities over time and across non-affiliated web sites, mobile applications, or online services, as applicable, and across multiple devices including connected TVs.
We collect information about your device and your visit(s) to websites, apps, and online services, such as browser type and version, Internet service provider (ISP), mobile operating system, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party, and/or clickstream data.
==========
We also collect information that identifies your devices, which may be considered Personal Information.
This information can include, for example, IP addresses, mobile advertising identifiers, and cookie identifiers.
Simplifi collects Precise Location Data (as defined by the NAI) for your device when, for example, a user makes such information available through a third-party mobile application or webpage on a particular device.
Simplifi also engages in cross-device linking.
==========
We may combine all of the information that we collect to provide our Advertising Services.
How We Collect and Use Information
We use cookies, JavaScript, and similar technologies to provide our Advertising Services.
==========
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the advertising content on our network of third-party sites.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personally identifiable information.
In performing our Advertising Services, we collect information in multiple ways, including:

 on our own websites
 on the websites of publishers or Advertising Customers that call our pixels (or “beacons”)
 when we serve online advertisements, and
 from third party providers

The collection of this data about your online activities across non-affiliated properties and linked devices allows us and our Advertising Customers to better target advertising to user interests.
==========
This process is called interest-based advertising.
The Advertising Services include various analytics and measurement services as well.
==========
The data also allows us to improve our services, for example, improving the effectiveness of the advertisements delivered to users and limiting the number of times a person sees a given advertisement.
Your Choices
EU Data Subjects: Processing of Personal Information
We process Personal Information with your consent.
On other occasions, we may process Personal Information when we need to do so to fulfill a contract (for example, for billing purposes) or where required to do this by law.
If necessary, we may also process Personal Information when it is in our legitimate interests to do this (e.g., for auditing purposes or for fraud detection) and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
EU data subjects may have rights to access, portability, to revoke consent, to correct, delete, and/or object to or restrict processing of the Personal Information you provide to us.
==========
You can email a request to us at privacy@simpli.fi.
We will respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with the law that applies to you.
Sometimes a request in relation to your Personal Information may not apply to certain information, such as information we may keep to comply with legal requirements.
==========
Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us.
To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.
==========
Opting Out of Simplifi Targeted Advertising on Your Browser 
Simpli.fi engages in interest-based advertising activities, including cross-device linking, as described above.
If you would like to stop receiving interest-based advertising from Simplifi on your browser, click here.
By doing so, Simplifi will replace your unique cookie with an “opt-out” cookie that will prevent us from serving you interest-based advertising.
==========
An opt-out choice means that we no longer use or transfer data from the opted out device for targeted advertisements, and we no longer use data collected on other devices to inform advertisements on that device.
We will still collect and store information through such cookies for other purposes such as metrics and analytics and we may still serve you advertising, but it will not be tailored for you.
Because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser or device, you will need to make your opt-out choice on each browser or device that you use.
==========
To do so, point each browser that you use to this page, and click on the disable link above.
Please note that you will need to set the Simplifi opt-out cookie again in some cases, for example, under the following circumstances: You buy a new computer, delete cookies from your browser, or upgrade the browser of your existing computer.
==========
Simplifi is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct.
Additional information on the NAI and its code can be viewed at http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code.
==========
Simplifi also licenses the AdChoices icon from the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) at http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/ and the DAAC at http://youradchoices.ca for the purpose of providing enhanced notice and to inform users when they are being behaviorally targeted and to provide an opportunity to opt out.
Simplifi makes every effort to ensure adherence to the self-regulatory principles of the DAA and the DAAC.

We currently honor Do Not Track signals transmitted by browsers by treating this signal as an opt out of interest-based advertising.
Opting Out from Simplifi Targeted Advertising on Your Mobile Device
Most devices come with an identifier for advertising purposes that allows advertisers to track and identify users’ consumer interests, and which also provide an opt out.
You can follow the instructions below to opt out of Simpli.fi’s interest-based advertising in mobile apps.
For iOS: Every iOS device comes with an identifier for advertising (IDFA), which has two key features:

It can be reset by the user at any time.
Users can opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called “Limit Ad Tracking” (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising.

To opt out or change your Advertising ID settings, follow these instructions.
