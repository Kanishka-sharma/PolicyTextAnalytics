Privacy Policy
What personal information does Xanga collect?
During registration, the only personal information that Xanga currently requests is your email address.
You may volunteer additional personal information at other times including, but not limited to, creating a Public Profile or updating your Personal Account Information.
Any additional personal information that you submit to Xanga will be protected under the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
==========
Browser Information
Every time you visit a page on the Internet, your web browser sends specific information to the web site you are visiting.
Xanga's server logs automatically collect and store this information from your web browser, including your IP address, specific type of browser software, Xanga-related cookies (see below), and the pages you visit at Xanga.
We use this information primarily to help diagnose and fix any technical problems that you may encounter.
But we also use IP information to help us limit access to Xanga by users who have violated our Terms of Use (or to help users block access to their Xanga sites by other users).
Cookies
Like most sites that have features requiring registration and sign-in, Xanga uses cookies to recognize you when you return to Xanga and to keep track of your username and password when you are signed in (so you don't have to re-sign in every time you visit a new page at Xanga).
==========
These cookies also help us provide you with customized content (including information about your Xanga site and promotions that you may find interesting - or, at least, not terribly annoying), based on your interests and activities at Xanga.
Who else collects personal information from me?
Any personal information that you volunteer on Xanga.com (any URL that starts with http://www.xanga.com) is collected by Xanga alone, unless specifically noted otherwise.
When you sign up for an affiliate program with one of the vendors promoted on your Xanga Site, you are submitting your personal information to that vendor.
Any personal information you volunteer to that vendor is subject to the terms and conditions of that vendor's privacy policy.
How does Xanga use my personal information?
Xanga.com uses your personal information primarily to customize your experience using the Site.
==========
The more information you volunteer, the better we can personalize Xanga's products and services to match your needs and interests.
Xanga uses your email address only to confirm your account and contact you in case of any problems with your account.
Upon your request, Xanga may forward additional information to your email address including, but not limited to, messages from visitors to your Xanga Site or additional information about the Company.
If you sign up for an affiliate program with one of the vendors promoted on your Xanga Site, Xanga will also forward emails from that vendor about your affiliate account.
==========
To continue to provide Xanga's products and services free-of-charge, Xanga may display advertisements or other promotional information.
Any additional personal information that you volunteer will help Xanga customize the advertisements it displays to match your interests.
Xanga does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers.
Xanga may share general demographic information with advertisers and business partners (such as aggregated statistics about members' interests and occupations).
==========
But Xanga never gives advertisers access to your individual personal account information.
How can I control the privacy of my Xanga Site?
You have complete control over which items and areas of your Xanga Site are publicly viewable.
==========
To change the privacy status of any item, click on the "public" or "private" label to the right of the item or the "edit or move" link to the right of the item.
Inside the resulting edit window, you will see a pair of radio buttons allowing you to alter the privacy status of the item.
"Public" items are published on a special public version of your Xanga Site, accessible to anyone browsing the Xanga Community.
"Private" items appear only on your private Xanga Site, accessible only by you (or anyone to whom you've given your username and secret password), invisible to the rest of the Xanga Community.
==========
What can I do to protect my Xanga account?
Be careful to keep your Xanga username and password secret!
Anyone who knows your username and password can log onto your Xanga account.
==========
If you are using a shared computer to access your Xanga account, remember to log out of Xanga before you leave that computer.
If you forget to log out, the next person who uses that shared computer may have access to your Xanga account.
To minimize the risk of other people accessing your private Xanga account, we suggest you log out of Xanga before you leave any computer that you use, even a personal one.
What does Xanga do to protect my private and personal information
Xanga.com has built a secure infrastructure to safeguard your private information.
We will continue to do everything we can to maintain and improve the security of our network.
After all, every Xanga employee is also an active Xanga member.
We all understand the importance of maintaining a secure system for our private and personal information.
No data transmission over the Internet, however, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Although Xanga pledges to put forth its best efforts to protect your private information, Xanga cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.
==========
For further information on this subject, please see our Terms of Use.
Children's Privacy
Xanga is intended for use by people who are at least 13 years old, and we will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
We have designed our registration process to make it clear that you must be at least 13 years old to participate in the Xanga community (including activities such as creating a Xanga site, leaving comments on other Xanga sites, and emailing Xanga members through the Xanga.com website).
Special Note to Parents
If you are the Parent or Legal Guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Xanga member and you would like his or her account deleted, please email us at: parents@xanga.com.
As soon as we are able to verify your identity (and status as parent or legal guardian) we will immediately delete your child's account.
You may also request to see a copy of any information that has been submitted by your child, prior to the account being deleted from our systems.
For more information about the kinds of personally identifiable information collected by Xanga, how it is collected, and how it is used by Xanga, please review this Privacy Policy as well as the Xanga Terms of Use.
For more information about protecting your child's privacy online, please visit the "Kidz Privacy" website operated by the Federal Trade Commission.
==========
Is there anything else I should know about privacy issues?
We will do everything in our power to maintain your privacy and online security.
Strong privacy and security, however, requires effort from both Xanga.com and its members.
==========
Please be sure to follow the advice listed above for protecting your Xanga account.
The best way to protect your privacy is to protect your password; change your password often, and keep it secret, even from Xanga.com employees.
Xanga.com employees will never ask you for your password.
