Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to DoubleClick, its advertisers and our affiliate Web sites.
Below is information about DoubleClick's commitment to protecting the privacy of users and to ensuring the integrity of the medium.
Anonymity
DoubleClick does not know the name, email address, phone number, or home address of anybody who visits a site in the DoubleClick Network.
All users who receive an ad targeted by DoubleClick's technology remain completely anonymous.
==========
Since we do not have any information concerning names or addresses, we do not sell or rent any such information to third parties.
Because of our efforts to keep users anonymous, the information DoubleClick has is useful only across the DoubleClick Network, and only in the context of ad selection.
==========
Opt Out
Cookies are small text files a Web site can use (thousands of sites are currently using them) to recognize a repeat visitor to its site.
Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage files.
==========
DoubleClick's cookie contains no information about you - only a unique number with no meaning whatsoever outside of the DoubleClick Network.
DoubleClick uses this number to track ad exposure.
In other words, to assure a user is not bombarded with the same ad over and over again.
While we believe that cookies enhance the Web experience for the user by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising.
==========
If you do not want the frequency of ad exposure controlled, there is a simple procedure that allows the user to deny or accept this feature.

==========
While some third parties offer programs to manually delete your cookies, DoubleClick goes one step further by offering you a "blank" or  "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being stored.

Honesty
