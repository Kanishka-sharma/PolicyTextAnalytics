Privacy Policy

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
It's short and you don't need to be a lawyer or an engineer to make sense of it.
If there are any technical terms that you don't understand, we encourage you to visit www.webopedia.com.
This resource will give you friendly definitions.
If you have any additional questions, please email 
        Adam Solomon, our Chief Privacy Officer at asolomon@starware.com.

==========
Starware has put in place strict guidelines-detailed below-to 
        demonstrate that we are acting in ways that we (as longtime citizens of 
        the Internet ourselves) expect to be treated when we visit websites on 
        the Internet.
If I visit Screensavers.com 
        or use the Screensavers.com services, will Starware send me unsolicited 
        commercial email ("spam")?
No.
==========
What personally identifiable 
        information is collected about visitors to Screensavers.com?
"Personally identifiable information" is non-anonymous information 
        such as your name, phone number, credit card information, address or email 
        address-anything that could identify you personally.
Visitors to Screensavers.com are not required to provide personally identifiable 
        information to use our site or services.
There are only two cases in which we receive names, email addresses, or 
        other information that identifies you personally.
The first is when people 
        contact us, for example, with a tech support question.
In such cases, 
        we keep this information confidential and use it strictly to respond to 
        these requests.
==========
The second is if you choose to submit your email address to voluntarily 
        subscribe to the Screensavers.com newsletter.
If you choose to subscribe 
        to a Screensavers.com newsletter, Starware will use your email address 
        for the sole purpose of emailing you the newsletter.
This information 
        will not be shared, or resold, to any other company without your explicit 
        consent.
Included in each of our newsletters will be instructions on how 
        to unsubscribe.
==========
Starware and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act: In an effort 
        to be compliant with COPPA, it is Starware policy to collect NO personally 
        identifiable information from children.
Therefore, all individuals are 
        required to be 14 years and older to submit their email address and subscribe 
        to the newsletters.
Will I get unsolicited email ("spam") from Starware or other companies because I subscribed to the Screensavers.com newsletter?
No.
==========
What anonymous information 
        is collected about visitors to Screensavers.com?
"Anonymous Information" means information that cannot be traced 
        back to you as a specific individual.
Starware receives standard web log 
        information: cookies, referrer IDs, IP addresses and system information.
None of this information identifies you personally -- it is anonymous 
        - and will never be combined or linked to any Personal Information.
What is a cookie?
A "cookie"is a small bit of record-keeping information that 
        websites often store on a user's computer.
Cookies do not include people's 
        names, email addresses, or other information that identifies you personally; 
        they are used to identify a computer, not a person.
==========
Cookie technology 
        is fairly commonplace on the Internet because cookies allow Websites to 
        personalize their service based on a user's preferences.
On most browsers, you can ask to be notified by your browser when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.
Starware does not require that you accept cookies, nor will we intentionally prevent you from using our Websites if you decline to accept cookies.
==========
What is a referrer ID?
A "referrer ID" is information from your web browser which shows 
        us what URL you linked from.
This allows us to see what websites link 
        to Screensavers.com.
==========
This information is automatically gathered by our 
        server.
Referrer IDs contain no information that identifies you personally.
What is an IP address?
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to 
        the Internet.
Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on 
        the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages 
        you request) can be sent to you.
They are automatically gathered by our 
        web server when you visit Screensavers.com.
==========
Starware will not use your 
        IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
What is system information?
System information we gather from our web logs includes time of your visit, 
        type of browser you used, and the operating system, platform and CPU speed 
        of your computer.
This kind of anonymous information is routinely sent 
        by your browser when you connect to websites.
Starware uses this information 
        only for broad demographic statistics.
For example: it tells us what percentage 
        of users have Netscape browsers versus Internet Explorer.
You will not 
        be personally identified by this information.
==========
We encourage you to periodically check back.
If we ever make changes to our privacy policy, we will post them here seven days before they go into effect.
