We also measure the exposure and engagement to online advertising campaign: number of impressions, number of clicks, numbers of users exposed, percentage of ad content played.
We collect information such as your reaction to the ad (skip the ad, click on the ad) for statistical reporting purposes or to limit serving you additional ads.

How do we use this information?
==========
We process the voice data to enable user interaction with the publishers’ and advertisers’ content, including offering the ability to purchase specific programming or items during the voice interaction.
Such voice data is retained for an appropriate amount of time for the processing of the requested transactions and any further period for purposes of the transaction and maintaining a legal record of the transactions.
We also process the data to find elements that will help us determine which products/services could be relevant to you and to improve the quality of the ads you’ll be served.
For example, we may use the geo-location data to determine potential likelihood to listen to an ad or we may use the data collected to prevent the same ads to be served to you repeatedly.
We also use the information we collect to maintain, improve and develop new services.
