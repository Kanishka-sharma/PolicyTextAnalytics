Welcome!
Stripe provides economic infrastructure for the internet.
==========
Businesses of all sizes use our software and services to accept payments and manage their businesses online.
Stripe cares about the security and privacy of the personal data that is entrusted to us.
==========
This policy describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, your rights and choices, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.
Stripe (“Stripe”, “we”, “our” or “us”) provides its services globally and the Stripe entity responsible for the collection and use of personal data under this Privacy Policy differs depending on your country.
We may collect and use personal data when we do business with you or when you do business with those that use our services.
==========
Some of our services may be accessed directly by you, including through our websites that reference this policy (e.g. stripe.com) (collectively “Sites”).
Many of our services are provided to others in connection with their own business and activities, and you may engage with Stripe services as part of another’s service, such as when you make a payment to a merchant and we provide the payment processing services to that merchant through Stripe Checkout (collectively, we refer to Sites and direct and indirect services as “Services”).
==========
This policy applies to Stripe’s own Services.
Websites, products and services of third-parties and some affiliates of Stripe are subject to their own separate privacy policies.
This Privacy Policy includes important information about your Personal Data and we encourage you to read it carefully.

If you are a Customer, your agreement with the relevant Stripe User should explain how the Stripe User shares your Personal Data with Stripe.
If you have questions about this sharing, then you should direct those questions to the Stripe User.

c. Fraud Prevention, Compliance and Security
We strive to make our Services safe, secure and compliant, and the collection and use of Personal Data is critical to this effort.
For example, we may monitor patterns of payment transactions and other online signals and use those insights to reduce the risk of fraud, money laundering and other activity that is harmful to Stripe, our Users and their Customers.
Personal Data helps us to identify those who engage with our Services and helps us detect and prevent activities of fraudulent and other bad actors.
In many cases, we are also required to collect identity and other information about transactions to fulfill legal reporting requirements.
(e.g. anti-money laundering laws or “know your customer” laws).
