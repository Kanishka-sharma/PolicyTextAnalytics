When bookdiva first stepped foot on the soil that which deviantART resides who ever would have thought that she would have grown in to the powerhouse that she is today?
After a little settling in period she began to slowly get in to the deviantART groove and went on a commenting spree that is reminiscent of some other popular deviants.
Bookdiva garnered an astounding 9518 deviation comments in 2002, which averages out to 28.84 comments a day!
Her comments go above and beyond and offer constructive criticism rather than a mere one-line praise of the submission.
On top of that she has been kind enough to send her thanks via deviant user page comments, which she controlled for 2002.
Her constant vigilance of new and exciting art exhibits and upcoming events in the world of art depict her as someone who is truly in love with art.
Overall, bookdiva has grown in to one devious deviant that is willing to help out anyone in need and continually displays her passion for the community, for people and for deviantART!
