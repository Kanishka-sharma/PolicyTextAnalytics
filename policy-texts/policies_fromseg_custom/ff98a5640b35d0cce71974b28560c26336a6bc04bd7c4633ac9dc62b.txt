"How private are my details?"
Apart from other companies in the IPL group, we only share personal information about you with third parties whom we have selected carefully and with whom we have, or may have, a commercial relationship.
IPL complies with the relevant legal requirements and takes all reasonable care to ensure that your information is secure and private and is only seen by responsible third parties.
However we cannot be held responsible for the actions of any third party who receives or obtains access to the information, or for any breach of security.
If you tell us that you do not want us to use your details, then data about your use of the Website would then only form part of aggregated statistics and would not be related to you as an individual.
