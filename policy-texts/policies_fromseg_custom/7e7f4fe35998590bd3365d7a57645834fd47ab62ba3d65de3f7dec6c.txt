As we describe in our privacy policy, we collect information to provide you wireless service, such as information about the websites you visit and the mobile applications you use on your wireless device, information about your use and purchase of our products and services, and additional details from your device such as device IDs and location data.
We and others may also use information about your usage, device, location, and demographics to serve you personalized ads, measure performance of those ads, and conduct analytics and reporting.
The type of mobile broadband, online, and device data we and others may collect and use for advertising and analytics include:
Like most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T‑Mobile works with advertising partners who collect—and with whom we may share—usage and device data, demographic data, and location data about customers and our site, as well as app visitors.
This data is used and shared to serve ads on our behalf, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.
We, along with advertising partners that deliver these ads, may place cookies and web beacons, or use mobile device identifiers and similar technologies on websites and apps—including T‑Mobile’s.
==========
This technology allows them to track device activity over time across online properties.
To learn more about this technology, visit our Cookies and Tracking Technologies article.
Ad partners' use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies.
==========
T‑Mobile may also use its own online advertising services in connection with these ad activities.
In addition, under T‑Mobile's personalized ads program, we use and analyze data from things like device and network diagnostic information (Android users only), apps on your device, and broadband information.
This data helps us understand more about user interests (e.g., sports enthusiast, loves cooking, etc.).
==========
Using this information, we create groups known as “audience segments,” which may be used by T‑Mobile or sold to third parties to make ads more relevant to you.
When we sell audience segments, we do not sell information that directly identifies customers, like name, address, or email.
Rather, audience segments are associated with mobile advertising IDs, which are long set of numbers and letters.
==========
For example, this might say something like "2drdn43np2cMapen084" is a sports enthusiast."
