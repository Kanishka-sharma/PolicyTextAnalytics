About ROBLOX

                        ROBLOX is an online virtual world and building game for kids.
ROBLOX works like
                        this:
                        

                        • a user creates a virtual character, that is his or her identity in the ROBLOX
                        world
                        
                        • users interact with other users through in-game chat, personal messaging (site
                        contained), and user forums; privacy settings allow users or parents to restrict
                        communications with other users
                        
                        • each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can
                        build houses, cars, machines, or anything else you can build with building blocks;
                        these places are called “games”
                        
                        • users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games
                        with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their virtual
                        character name
                        
                        • users earn tickets and/or ROBUX, our virtual currency; users earn these in a variety
                        of ways, and use them to buy items for their characters, including virtual hats,
                        shirts, and pants; users can also sell these items, earning tickets and/or ROBUX
                        
                        • users can purchase premium services, including: Builder’s Club, a monthly subscription
                        that grants the user more virtual places and a daily allowance, among other things;
                        and, ROBUX currency, allowing users to buy virtual currency that can in turn be
                        used to buy virtual goods
                    

                        Requested Information

                        ROBLOX users may play as guests; in this mode, users remain anonymous and interact
                        with the website and game in Menu Chat Mode – no free chat, no personal messaging
                        to or from users, no posting to the forums, and other restrictions designed to prevent
                        users from sharing personal information, intentional or otherwise.
As guests, users
                        are unable to save play statistics, accumulate points, share models, or participate
                        in our virtual economy.
Users wishing to save statistics, share models, and participate in the economy are
                        required to enter a username and password.
We advise users to create a username
                        that does not reflect their own name nor reveal personally identifiable information.
We also advise users to pick a password that is not easy to guess, and to not share
                        that password.
For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form.
Registered users who are under 13 initially play in Menu Chat Mode.
==========
To opt-in to
                        free (but filtered) text communications, users are required to provide and verify
                        a parent’s email address.
We use this information to inform parents that their child
                        has signed up to use our service; we also use this information to obtain consent
                        from the parent regarding their child’s continued use of the site.
The verification
                        email we send informs parents of their child’s registration with ROBLOX and provides
                        access to a parental control panel (parent’s may also create parental controls at
                        any time).
Under-13 users who do not enter a parent’s email address or who fail
                        to verify one remain in Privacy Mode.
Registered users who are 13 or older can opt-in
                        to Privacy Mode, but begin with it turned off.
==========
Regardless of security and privacy settings, all text on the site is filtered proactively
                        to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, age, and other personally
                        identifiable information.
All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and
                        adult or suggestive content.
Our system is a combination human and automated processes;
                        like all filtering technology, our processes are not 100% effective.
==========
Users wishing to purchase Builder’s Club or ROBUX are required to enter billing
                        information, including name, billing address, credit card or PayPal number, and
                        billing email.
For children under 13, we request the parent’s billing information.
Billing information is retained to support customer service inquiries, but we do
                        not retain the full credit card number.
==========
If you (or your child) choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about
                        our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.
We will automatically
                        send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site; ROBLOX
                        does not store this information.
We do not collect any Personal Information from children only username and password.
We do not ask for and collect from a kid under 13 personally identifiable information
                        that is reasonably necessary for that kid to participate in any given activity online

                        Collected Information

                        ROBLOX uses a software technology called “cookies.”
Cookies are small text files
                        that we place in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences.
These cookies
                        do not store personally identifiable information.
For account security purposes,
                        we may store a cookie that contains the encrypted user password; the original password
                        cannot be recovered by hackers.
Users who disable cookies in their browsers will
                        not be able to logon to the ROBLOX website or play the ROBLOX game.
We also use cookies and “clear gifs” (on-page tracking code) to track user entry
                        onto and movement within the ROBLOX website.
This helps us credit advertisers appropriately,
                        and measure the health and effectiveness of our website.
For example, we use tracking
                        to determine if new page designs are user friendly or too complicated.
Our tracking
                        approach is industry standard, and includes non-personally identifiable information
                        such as IP address, browser type, and date/time.
Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally
                        identifiable “computer” information, such as the type of computer operating system
                        (e.g., Windows 95 or Mac OS), the web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer)
                        being used, IP address, and information regarding the Internet service provider.
==========
This information is used to provide technical and community support.
We also collect performance data from within ROBLOX Studio or the ROBLOX Player.
We use this data retrospectively to improve the user experience of our games.
This
                        information includes in-game networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage,
                        among other relevant data.
==========
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.
We have
                        no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use
                        of cookies by ROBLOX (www.roblox.com) only and does not cover the use of cookies
                        by any advertisers.
==========
Information Sharing

                        We pass user billing information on to PayPal, our transaction processing partner.
This is done for all payment types, including credit card and PayPal payments.
For
                        recurring monthly transactions, PayPal retains the credit card authorization on
                        file, but we do not.
All transactions are processed by PayPal.
==========
We share aggregate web activity data, such as page views and unique visitor counts,
                        with our advertising partners.
No personally identifiable information is shared.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required
                        by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or
                        comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web
                        site.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personally identifiable
                        information in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's (including
                        schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent
                        the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety
                        or protect the safety of a child using our website, protect the security or integrity
                        of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability.
We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are
                        materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental
                        notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different
                        uses.
Security & Privacy

                        The security of your personal information is important to us.
==========
When you enter sensitive
                        information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we
                        encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
                        submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission
                        over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore,
                        while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information,
                        we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be
                        aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,
                        collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you
                        unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information
                        you choose to submit in these forums.
==========
Options for Parents

                        Parents can set up a parental control panel to manage the privacy settings of their
                        children.
If a child enters a parent’s email address during signup, the parent receives
                        an email notification of the account creation and an invitation to establish a control
                        panel for that account.
Parents can also create a control panel at any time and
                        attach it to a child’s existing account.
A parent receiving a verification email has three options.
==========
First, the parent can
                        choose not to respond; in this case, the child remains in Menu Chat Mode.
Second,
                        the parent can choose to click the link in the email and do nothing more; in this
                        case, the child is opted-in to free (but filtered) text communications, including
                        free-text chat and personal messaging (site limited), forum posts, and site commentary.
Third, the parent can choose to click the link in the email and then create a parental
                        control account; in this case, the parent can set fine-grained security and privacy
                        options.
Parents can close a child’s account by contacting ROBLOX customer service (see below).
This hides the account from all other ROBLOX users and outside parties.
==========
The account
                        data is not deleted, but retained internally for three purposes.
Billing information
                        and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and
                        inquiries.
Public domain content is retained for use by the community – e.g. a virtual
                        shirt sold by the child to another user is kept in the system because the recipient
                        now “owns” a copy of that article.
Finally, user account history is retained to
                        support subsequent customer service inquiries.
All retained data for a closed account
                        is private and visible only to employees.

                        our service, you may correct, update, amend, or deactivate it by making the change
                        on our member information page (or by emailing our Customer Support at info@roblox.com)
