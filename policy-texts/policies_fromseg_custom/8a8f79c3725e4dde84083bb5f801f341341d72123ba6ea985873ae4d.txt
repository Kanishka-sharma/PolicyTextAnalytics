Personal Data
You may enter the Website and browse its content without submitting any Personal Data.
However, we will need to collect relevant Personal Data to provide you with certain services offered by the Platform, including if you choose to create an account on our website, contact us or otherwise communicate with us in any way, subscribe or opt in to our newsletter, alerts, or other communications, subscribe or opt in to SMS messages, sign up for product waitlists, participate in a contest or promotion, order our products, submit product reviews, questions, feedback or user comments, complete an optional survey, contact customer service or otherwise interact with the Platform.
We use the Personal Data that we collect to respond to your requests, communicate with you regarding the Platform and our content, send you promotional or marketing communications, guard against potential fraud, provide product information, service your requests and orders, and provide you with the applicable services, features or functionality associated with your submission.
When you submit Personal Data through the Platform, whether by directly providing it to us upon request or voluntarily disclosing it through comments, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

If you connect through a Social Network, we may collect Personal Data from your profile, such as your name, username, and e-mail address, and we will use that Personal Data for the purposes set forth herein.
In addition, our Platform may offer social sharing features which will allow you to “Share” or “Like” on a Social Network.
If you decide to use such features, it may allow the sharing and collection of Information both to and from such Social Network, so you should check the privacy policy of each Social Network before using such features.
==========
Sharing of Information
In no event will we disclose, rent, sell or share any of your Personal Data to third parties for direct marketing purposes.
We only share your Information with third parties for the purposes described below.
We contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services related to the functionality and features of the Platform, including content streaming, email and hosting services, software development, data management, orders, payment processing, management of forms, quizzes and polls, customer service, returns, live chat, marketing, fraud prevention, product review and questions, and administration of contests and other promotions.
We call them our “Service Providers.”
We may share your Information with Service Providers as appropriate for them to perform their services for us and our Service Providers are permitted to use your Information only for such purposes.

We may also share or transfer Device Information and Usage Data in aggregated, anonymized form with or to our affiliates, licensees, partners and Service Providers for administrative, analytical, research, optimization, and security purposes, but no such Information will be linked with your Personal Data or be used to identify or contact you.
Finally, we may share your Information: (i) In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us; (ii) When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms of Use and other agreements; or (iii) In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
==========
Notwithstanding any of the above, we will not share your Personal Data if such sharing is prohibited by applicable privacy and data protection law, including, without limitation, the EEA’s General Data Protection Regulation effective May 25, 2018 and the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) which will come into effect on January 1, 2020.
Automated Data Collection / Cookies
We may use certain automatic analytics and tracking technologies to assist us in performing a variety of functions, including storing your Information, collecting Device Information and Usage Data, understanding your use of the Platform and customizing the content offered to you on the Platform.
We may use platforms like Google Analytics to provide aggregated or anonymized information relating to demographics, geography, interests or affinities.
==========
Other technologies we may use include:
(1) Cookies.
Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences.
We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the Platform and the content, offerings, or advertisements you see on the Platform.
For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on the Platform or remember any settings you have chosen.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this.
However, not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Platform unavailable to you.
(2) Web Beacons.
We may also use "web beacons" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page or email.
For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.
Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).
==========
(3) Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.
We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers or app developer platforms that use, mobile Software Development Kits ("SDKs") that are incorporated into the Platform to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), geolocation information, and other information about your device or use of the Platform.
A mobile SDK may act as the mobile version of a web beacon (see "Web Beacons" above).
==========
By visiting the Platform, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Platform through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.
Please note that no such tracking technologies will collect any Personal Data from you unless you choose to submit it to us and that data relating to you individually is not shared with any third parties.

SMS Messaging
At your option, you may communicate through SMS messages regarding your orders and our products.
Normal text rates apply to such messages.
You may withdraw permission to communicate with you by SMS at any time.
We do not receive any individualized geographic information from you when you receive or reply to such messages.
==========
Personal Data Retention
We retain the Personal Data we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use the Platform or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
Privacy and Security 
It is entirely your choice whether or not you provide Personal Data to us.
We take reasonable precautions to protect our customers' Personal Data against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
==========
However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Information that you transmit to us or from us, and you do so at your own risk.
You hereby acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.
If you believe your Personal Data is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at privacy@skims.com.
Use of Automated Decision Making and Profiling
We use automated decision making and profiling.
We do this in order to protect our business from harm from fraud during the checkout process via a third-party service provider.
==========
Children Under 13
The Platform is intended for and targeted to adults.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data directly from anyone under the age of 13.
If you are under 13, please do not send any Personal Data about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

Links to Third Party Platforms
Our Platform or communications may contain links to third party websites, over which we exercise no control, including the form of embedded content, sponsored content or co-branded content.
Except as set forth in this Policy, we do not share your Personal Data with those third parties and are not responsible for the privacy policies of any third party or their management of your Personal Data.
Because they may treat your Information differently than we do, we suggest you read the privacy policies on those third-party websites prior to submitting any Personal Data to such sites.
In addition, you may be redirected to a third-party platform for certain functions, including returns, forms, and customer service.

==========
Your California Privacy Rights
The following section pertains to the rights of individuals or households in California (“California consumers”).
Civil Code Section 1798.83
Under certain circumstances, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 states that, upon receipt of a request by a California consumer, a business may be required to provide detailed information regarding how that business has shared that customer’s Personal Information with third parties for direct marking purposes.
Rights under the CCPA
After January 1, 2020, the CCPA (California Civil Code Section 1798.100 et seq.) will provide California consumers with additional rights regarding Personal Information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly with a particular consumer or household.
==========
The categories of Personal Information we collect are generally described above but differ for individual consumers depending on the Services used by such consumers.
Under the CCPA, qualifying California consumers may have the following rights:
Right to Know and Right to Delete
A California consumer has the right to request that we disclose what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose and sell.
A California consumer also has the right to submit requests to delete Personal Information.
When we receive a request to know or delete from a California consumer, we will confirm receipt of the request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process the request, including our verification process.
We will respond to such requests within 45 days.
==========
Right for Disclosure of Information
A California consumer may also submit requests that we disclose specific types or categories of Personal Information that we collect.
Under certain circumstances, we will not provide such information, including where the disclosure creates a substantial, articulable and unreasonable risk to the security of that Personal Information, customers’ account with us, or the security of our systems or networks.
We also will not disclose California consumers’ social security numbers, driver’s license numbers or other government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, any health insurance or medical identification numbers, or account passwords and security questions and answers.
==========
Submitting Requests
If you are a California consumer and would like to make any requests under the CCPA, please click here or direct them to the following address:
Skims Body, Inc.Attn: Privacy3113 S. La Cienega Blvd.Los Angeles, CA 90016E-mail: privacy@skims.com
Verifying Requests
If we receive any request we will use a two-step process for online requests where the California consumer must first, clearly submit the request and then second, separately confirm the request.
We will use other appropriate measures to verify requests received by mail or telephone.
In submitting a request, a California consumer must provide sufficient information to identify the consumer, such as name, e-mail address, home or work address, or other such information that is on record with us so that we can match such information to the Personal Information that we maintain.
Do not provide social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, medical information or health information with requests.
If requests are unclear or submitted through means other than outline above, we will provide the California consumer with specific directions on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies.
If we cannot verify the identity of the requestor, we may deny the request.
==========
California Do Not Track Disclosures
Although some browsers currently offer a “do not track (‘DNT’) option,” no common industry standard for DNT exists.
We therefore do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals.
International Data Transfers
If you are resident outside the United States, including in the EEA, we transfer Personal Data provided by you for processing in the United States, including Personal Information sent via e-mails or when you make an order.
Under the GDPR, we are considered a “controller” and a “co-processor” of the Personal Data of EEA Residents.
By providing Personal Data to us for the purpose of using the Platform, you consent to the processing of such data in the United States.
The transfer of your Personal Data to the United States is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us for your use of the Platform.
==========
Please note that the United States does not have data protection laws equivalent to those in the EEA and other jurisdictions.
Rights of EEA Residents
