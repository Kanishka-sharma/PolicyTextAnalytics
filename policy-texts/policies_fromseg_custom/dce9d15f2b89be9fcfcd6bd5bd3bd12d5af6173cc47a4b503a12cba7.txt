We collect the following types of information about you:

Information you provide us directly: 
We ask for certain information such as your username, real name, birthdate, address, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a wikiHow account, or if you correspond with us.
We collect your email address when you choose to sign up for our newsletters.
==========
We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.
We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.

Your username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly.
Once published, your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed entirely from the Service.
==========
Information we may receive from third parties: 
We may receive information about you from third parties.
For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the wikiHow application, linking your account to the wikiHow Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to wikiHow.
This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.
If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join wikiHow.
You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the wikiHow Service.
You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.
==========
Inviting a friend to use wikiHow: 
wikiHow may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the Service.
If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list.
You understand that by inviting a friend to wikiHow through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list.
==========
In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from you phone.
Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.
==========
Finding your friends on the Service: 
wikiHow may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to locate your friends with wikiHow accounts through a “Find friends” feature.
The “Find friends” feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on wikiHow.
If you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then you agree to provide wikiHow access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using wikiHow.
If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites.
If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames, then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service.
Note that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on wikiHow.
==========
