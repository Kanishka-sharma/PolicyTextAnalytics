==========
The information we collect and how we may use that information may vary depending upon the product, service or Schwab affiliate involved.

Provide you with better service or to perform services on your behalf;

Make it more convenient for you to open a new account.
==========
At any time, you may instruct Schwab not to share information about you with our affiliates for certain purposes, as explained below under “How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Your Information.”
How We Share Your Information Outside of Schwab
We may share your information with outside companies and other third parties in certain limited circumstances, including:
To help us process transactions for your account;
When we use other companies to provide services for us, such as printing and mailing your account statements;
When we believe that disclosure is required or permitted under law (for example, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement, resolve consumer disputes, perform credit/authentication checks or for risk control).
Certain Schwab affiliates and subsidiaries may also enter into a joint-marketing agreement with another financial institution in order to provide you with a Schwab-branded financial product or service.
How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Your Information
You may choose to limit the information we share about you among our affiliates and joint-marketing partners for marketing purposes.
If you choose to do so, Schwab will not share with our affiliates consumer reports and other personal information about you that may be used to determine your eligibility for credit (for example, information about your income, profession or employment status); allow our affiliates to market their financial products or services to you based on eligibility information they receive from another Schwab affiliate; or share personal information about you with an outside company for joint-marketing purposes.
==========
You may exercise this choice by contacting us at the numbers in the “Contact Us” section.
You only need to contact us once, and your choice will be honored across all of Schwab.
Your choice will be applied to you as an individual and will automatically be extended to all of your accounts at Schwab.
If you have a joint account, you may limit the sharing of information on behalf of another account holder but only in relation to the joint account.
==========
You may make your affiliate-sharing privacy choice at any time, and that choice will remain in effect until you tell Schwab to change it.
If you have previously provided Schwab with this information with respect to your current accounts, you do not need to provide it again.
==========
If you exercise your privacy choice, Schwab will continue to share information among our affiliates that identifies you (such as your name and Social Security number), as well as information about your transactions and experiences with us, to perform services on your behalf, respond to communications from you, or, if you are their customer, to offer you products or services.
Schwab also allows you to limit marketing from the Schwab affiliate(s) with which you have a relationship.
This is separate from your affiliate-sharing choice.
==========
You may do so by calling Schwab at the customer service number listed on your account statement.
These preferences will remain in effect for at least five years, after which time Schwab may ask you to update those preferences and may contact you for marketing purposes.
State Laws
Schwab will comply with state laws that apply to the disclosure or use of information about you.
If you are a Vermont resident, we will automatically limit information sharing without your having to advise us of your privacy choice.
