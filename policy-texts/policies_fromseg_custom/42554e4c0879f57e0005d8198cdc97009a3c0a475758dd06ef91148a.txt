Company-Specific Do-Not-Call Requests
Laureate and its affiliates maintain an internal do-not-call (DNC) list that includes specific requests from consumers who do not wish to be called by Laureate or any of its affiliates.
This DNC list is used enterprise-wide.
Laureate and its affiliates purge from any calling list any names and/or numbers on its company-specific DNC list.
Any consumer can prohibit Laureate from calling by asking to be put on Laureate’s DNC list.
A consumer’s do-not-call request will be recorded in our database within the legally mandated timeframes.
Federal regulations require Laureate to honor DNC requests within 30 days.
Company-specific DNC requests may be placed by sending an electronic mail notification to removeme@laureate-inc.com.
