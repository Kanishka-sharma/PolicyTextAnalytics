Our Privacy Policy


Overview
 
American Greetings is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its 
interactive products and services.
Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a 
safe and secure environment for consumers.
The purpose of this AMERICANGREETINGS.COM privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit AMERICANGREETINGS.COM.
We also want to tell you how we may use that information, 
whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability 
to correct, the information.
Finally, please note that this policy applies only to AMERICANGREETINGS.COM and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link.
Information About All AMERICANGREETINGS.COM Visitors
 
In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and 
frequency of visitors to AMERICANGREETINGS.COM and its areas, very much like television 
ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program.
==========
We only use such data in 
aggregate.
This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the 
site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many 
of you as possible.
For example, AMERICANGREETINGS.COM uses a technology nicknamed 
"cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people.
AMERICANGREETINGS.COM cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable 
information to tell us who you are or what your e-mail address or screen name is.
We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our AMERICANGREETINGS.COM partners about how our members, collectively, use AMERICANGREETINGS.COM.
We do this so they too can understand how much people use 
their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience 
as well.
==========
Information About You
 
Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service 
when you order a product.
We will need certain information -- such as name, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to 
you.
We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about 
which you might be interested.
You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want 
by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service.
We 
may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of 
the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not.
==========
Disclosure
 
We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to AMERICANGREETINGS.COM or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies.
But as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of AMERICANGREETINGS.COM.
