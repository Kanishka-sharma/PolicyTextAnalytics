Use of Data
When you use an EA Service, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device, including information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your EA Service usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware (for example, to protect your game stats, EA may place a randomly generated identification number in the keychain storage of your device.
That identifier will be removed when you reset your device).
If you play an EA Service offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet.
