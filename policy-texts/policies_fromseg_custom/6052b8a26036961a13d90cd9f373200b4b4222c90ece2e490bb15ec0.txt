Local Shared Objects (“Flash cookies”)
Local Shared Objects (aka “Flash cookies”) and local storage in HTML5 may also be used on our Site and Services to enhance your experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings like volume/mute settings.
Local Shared Objects are data files similar to browser cookies, but can store more complex data than simple text.
You can manage local shared objects by following the instructions on Adobe’s help site here.

HTML email web beacons
Our emails may contain a single, campaign-unique “web beacon pixel” to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links within the email.
We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to you, to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them.
The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email.
If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.

Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting.
New Relic does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
New Relic takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.
