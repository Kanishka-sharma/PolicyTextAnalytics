Most web browsers allow you to disable cookies, and you are welcome to continue to use the Service if you choose to do so.
However, some of the Service’s features may not function properly if cookies are disabled.
==========
Wikia uses some of those cookies and the data tracked by some of those cookies in conjunction with various advertisers and advertising networks.
Wikia has no control over the cookies and other information collected by advertising and advertising networks which service ads on Wikia, and this policy does not apply to the information collected in regard to either of those services.
Wikia’s user data is stored in the United States, and its servers log some information whenever you access the Service; information such as your IP address, the time of your visit, your browser type and your browser's language setting.

Online behavioral advertisingEdit
Wikia may use Online behavioral advertising ("OBA") or multi-site advertising on some wikis.
We collect data on the number of pages you visit per day, in order to support frequency capped advertising campaigns for certain advertisers or to improve the ad targeting based on the types of wikis you visit on Wikia.
Third parties may also leave a cookie with your browser to track your visits to Wikia.
