Our Provision of Services to Customers
We are an application services provider, meaning that we host a software application that our customers access via the worldwide Web.
Although we acknowledge that end users have a right to access their personal information collected by our customers, we have no direct business relationship with the end users of our customers.
Please direct your requests to our customers.
==========
We also have no control over the content of the advertisement, including any cookies and web beacons set by advertisers on our customers’ sites.
Each customer understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive information from the Web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such customer’s Web property or viewing content that is owned or displayed by such customer.
This information includes frequency of ads delivered and other delivery statistics, time, browser type and version, visitor’s operating system, device type, referral URL, visitors’ IP addresses, visitors’ countries inferred from their IP addresses, and cookie data, including User IDs.
==========
We require our customers to obtain consent for our use of such information and we use it for our provision of Services and enforcement of our rights as described in the applicable customer contract, to improve our Services, and to compile aggregated statistics for internal or marketing purposes.
The visitor information that we collect, store, and use on our customers’ behalf is not intended to identify individual persons and we do not possess or have access to information that could match IP addresses or User IDs to the identity of individuals.
We do not allow visitor information collected and stored for one customer to be accessed by any other customer.
Further, we may use and retain such information only as provided in its agreement with its customer.
We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services.

We also require each customer to permit no personally identifiable information to be sent to us (other than IP addresses).
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to our applicable customer (the data controller) which has transferred such data to us for processing.
If requested to remove data we will respond to such request within a reasonable timeframe.
==========
Tracking and End User Opt-Out
Tracking Policy: FreeWheel adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-regulatory Principles of Online Behavioral Advertising <http://www.aboutads.info/principles>.
Companies that engage in Online Behavioral Advertising (“OBA,” also called Interest-based Advertising) use information gathered about your visits over time and across different Web sites or applications in order to predict your preferences and show you ads that are more likely to be of interest to you.
While FreeWheel itself does not engage in Online Behavioral Advertising, certain of FreeWheel’s Services enable its customers to use audience data to enhance their targeting of ads.
For these reasons, FreeWheel has elected to participate in the DAA’s Consumer Choice Page <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> in order to offer you the ability to elect not to receive such targeted advertising from FreeWheel customers.
FreeWheel SAS does not collect data, nor set cookies, to build profiles for OBA.
Some of FreeWheel SAS’ buying partners may do this from their systems.
You should check http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ to understand which companies use this data and opt­out if you wish to.
==========
User Tracking – Desktop: Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that are designed to store basic information.
We use a cookie in connection with our provision of Services.
This cookie does not store any personally-identifiable information and is not otherwise used to provide your identity; it merely is used to recognize your browser.
Our cookie is not specific to any of our individual customers.
Accordingly, if you choose to opt-out of our cookie for any of our customers, you will be opted out for all of the Web sites and customers that use our Services.

Click here to replace your unique FreeWheel SAS cookie with an opt-out FreeWheel SAS cookie.
If you select an opt-out cookie, ads delivered to your browser on behalf of customers using our ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information that is automatically transmitted in the Internet environment when an ad request is received by our ad servers.
In such case, your cookie will not be uniquely identified.
The non-personally identifiable information that is automatically transmitted includes your browser type, Internet service provider, information about the general content of the site or page displayed on your browser, and other non-personally identifiable information provided by the Web site or customer.
When you receive this cookie, our systems will know that you have opted out and will not attempt to assign other of our companies’ cookies in the future.
Since the opt-out cookie does not contain a unique user number, it does not allow your browser to be identified uniquely.

Location Tracking: Standard functionality of FreeWheel’s Monetization Rights Management® Service (“MRM”) enables MRM customers to associate a zip code from the IP address FreeWheel collects from you when you view an ad FreeWheel has served.
FreeWheel may, on behalf of a customer, use this location information to improve the relevance of ads you see.
FreeWheel SAS does not collect or utilize such location information.
The Services also enable FreeWheel to obtain precise information about your location from ads FreeWheel serves to your mobile device.

None of the principles in this Statement changed following FreeWheel’s acquisition by Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast”).
All of FreeWheel’s contractual obligations with respect to each customer’s information have remained and will remain intact.
Also, post-acquisition, FreeWheel will continue to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comcast, meaning the two companies will be separate legal entities.
As such, FreeWheel cannot per the terms of its agreement with each customer allow Comcast (or any of Comcast’s other affiliates) to access FreeWheel customer data for any purpose.
Maintaining FreeWheel’s status as a trusted partner is critical to the continued success of our business.
Comcast and FreeWheel have been careful to structure the acquisition so as not to disrupt that trust.
