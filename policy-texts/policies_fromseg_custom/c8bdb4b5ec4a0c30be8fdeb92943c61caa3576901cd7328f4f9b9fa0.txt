In order to improve the usefulness of our web site for our visitors,
        we automatically collect and maintain statistical information from our site's
        data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume.
This information consists of:
        
the name of the domain from which the visitor accesses the Internet

This information does not identify individual visitors.
It is retained for a minimum
