Partners of 1plusX
While 1plusX actively communicates high data protection standards to its partners through contractual agreements and other measures, the partners themselves are responsible for compliance and therefore 1plusX cannot be held liable for any violation of the 1plusX data protection guidelines by one of the partners used by 1plusX.
1plusX works together with the following partners for the playout of advertising:
Adition Technologies
AppNexus
Digital Element
DoubleClick Bid Manager
DoubleClick for Publishers
Smart Ad Server
MediaMath
AdForm
When working with these partners, some data is also transmitted to their ad servers, some of which may be located in countries outside the European Union.
This is pseudonymised cookie information (cookie ID or device ID) and the assignment to relevant advertising segments.
In this respect, it is ensured that an appropriate level of data protection exists in each case.
==========
