California “Do Not Sell My Info”
The California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) requires us to disclose categories of personal information sold to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales.
The CCPA defines personal information to include online identifiers, including IP address, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs.
The law also defines a “sale” to include simply making data available to third parties in some cases.

Further, exercising this choice will not necessarily opt you out of the use of previously sold personal information or stop all interest-based advertising.
