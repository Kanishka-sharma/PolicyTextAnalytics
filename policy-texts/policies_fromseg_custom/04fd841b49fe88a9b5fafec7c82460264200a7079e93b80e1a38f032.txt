If you are a customer or a prospect your request should at a minimum include the following:
Your full name
the name of your company ; and,

It helps us do things like view the URL of the page in which the clear gif appears, and the time our Site and the email in question is viewed.
In emails, clear gifs help us confirm the receipt of and respond to our emails including but not limited to, those that users forward to friends and family, as well as to help us deliver a more personalized online experience.
==========
As a user uses the Site, their browser and other devices, like certain types of phones and tablets, communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and service providers, to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill their requests for Services and information.

We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes.
==========
These include but aren’t limited to, retrieving certain information a User has previously provided (like their password, if they asked to be remembered), and storing that User’s preferences, such as the types of Services in which they’ve told us they’re interested.
“Pixel tags” are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether a User has performed certain specific actions.
When that User accesses these pages or opens our email messages, the pixel tags generate a notice of that action to us and/or our service providers.
These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.

Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of the devices a User uses to interact with the Site.
