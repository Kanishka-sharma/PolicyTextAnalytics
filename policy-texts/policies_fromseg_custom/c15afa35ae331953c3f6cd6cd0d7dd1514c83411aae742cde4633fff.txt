33Across, Inc. ("33Across") provides marketing technology and services to website owners and online marketers (our "Clients").
Our mission is to improve the online experience by delivering more relevant advertising to consumers.
We consider the protection of user privacy and anonymity to be of paramount importance, and provide this privacy policy to inform consumers about how our technology collects and uses consumer data.
This policy also outlines our privacy practices on our corporate Website ("Website"), www.33across.com.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at
.
By visiting the Website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this privacy policy.
This privacy policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that 33Across does not employ or manage.
PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY
OVERVIEW OF OUR TECHNOLOGY
33Across provides technology services to Clients that enable them to collect and use Social Engagement Data to improve the relevance of advertising which appears on web pages.
"Social Engagement Data" consists of anonymous information regarding the relationships between people, the website pages they visit and/or the actions they take on a website, such as installing or sharing applications, widgets or other content.
For example, 33Across may collect Social Engagement Data when an individual visits a Client's webpage, installs or shares an application, or connects with friends from within one of our Client(s) websites.
Data is only collected from the websites of Clients who use our services.
Clients use the Social Engagement Data we capture to classify website users who are likely to share similar interests or preferences.
For example, if a person expresses an interest in comedy films, our technology would help our Clients identify other people who are likely to enjoy comedy films based on similarities in Social Engagement Data between the different people.
By using our technology, Clients categorize people with similar characteristics or interests, improving their ability to deliver more relevant advertising.
33Across maintains Social Engagement Data for up to 60 days for purposes of identifying people with similar characteristics or interests.
After 60 days, Social Engagement Data is no longer used for these purposes, but is used for research and reporting on an aggregated basis for up to 2 years.
==========
You may encounter our technology when: you visit one of our Clients' websites; we purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when our Clients purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit.
DATA OUR TECHNOLOGY COLLECTS FROM CLIENT WEBSITES
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") means any data which identifies you personally, such as name, address, email, or telephone number.
We do not collect PII from Client websites via our Technology.
NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
When you are on the website of one of our Clients, our technology collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII"), which refers to information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity.
Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type (for example Internet Explorer or Mozilla), operating system (for example Windows or Macintosh), the URL of Client website pages or sections that you visit, and Social Engagement Data.
USAGE OF COOKIES
Nearly all websites, including those of our Clients, use a feature of your internet browser to set a "cookie" on your computer.
==========
Cookies are small text files that contain alphanumeric characters.
The website which places a cookie on your computer can then recognize the computer when you revisit the site.
This enables the site to provide services such as automatic log-on, customizable content or settings, and relevant ad delivery.
Our technology uses cookies to help make the advertising you see more relevant.
You are always free to decline to receive cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use many common website features or take advantage of targeted advertising.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.
(Each browser is different, so check the ''Help'' menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)
==========
You may click HERE to opt-out of data collection and targeting cookies from 33Across.
Additionally, 33Across is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and is compliant with the NAI's Self-Regulatory Principles.
You may click HERE to find out more about the NAI's Self-Regulatory Program and to opt out of 33Across and other NAI member company advertising programs.
==========
Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising.
It does mean that 33Across will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.
The 33Across Opt-out Tool is cookie-based.
==========
In order for the Tool to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies.
If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again.
Be advised that if you change computers or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser.
