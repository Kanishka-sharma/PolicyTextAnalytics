TRUSTe’s Privacy Statement

Described below is 
        our privacy policy regarding the information collected on the TRUSTe Web 
        site.

We use email links 
        located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact us 
        directly with any questions or comments you may have.
We read every message 
        sent in and try to reply promptly to every one.
This information is used 
        to respond directly to your questions or comments.
We may also file your 
        comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information.
Your personal information is only shared with third parties with your 
        explicit permission.
==========
WatchDog
TRUSTe created the 
        WatchDog page to provide you with a mechanism for reporting privacy violations, 
        misuse of the trustmark, or specific privacy concerns pertaining to a 
        member Web site.
We request your name, email address, name of the Web 
        site, URL, and description of the privacy violation.
This information 
        is used to look into the alleged violation to come to a satisfactory resolution.
==========
Certain personally identifiable information like your name and email address 
        may be shared with the member site, but only if you indicate that we have 
        your permission to do this by marking the appropriate boxes.
If you do 
        not give us your permission to share your personally identifiable information, 
        then we will not share it with anyone outside of TRUSTe.
However, in some 
        cases, this may limit our ability to successfully resolve your complaint.
Any contact information a user provides on the WatchDog page is optional.
Logged Files

The TRUSTe Web site 
        logs IP addresses and browser types for systems administration purposes 
        and these logs will be analyzed to constantly improve the value of the 
        materials available on the website.
We do not link IP addresses to anything 
        personally identifiable.
This means that a user’s session will be tracked, 
        but the user will be anonymous.
Coordinator`s Site
The Licensees Only 
        section asks you to enter your contact information into the Coordinator`s 
        Site.
This portion of the Web site is only accessible to TRUSTe licensees.
Either a username and password, or confirmation number are required to 
        enter.
Contact information may include name, email address, postal address, 
        phone number, fax number, and domain names.
==========
The contact information you 
        enter at the Licensees Only section (Coordinator`s Site) 
        is used to contact the Site Coordinator should TRUSTe have to work with 
        the site regarding implementation, customer inquiries, and other various 
        reasons.
This information also allows us to get in contact with the appropriate 
        people in order to conduct conformance reviews when appropriate.
This 
        information is not shared with anybody outside of TRUSTe unless verbal 
        or written permission is given by the Site Coordinator.
Privacy Wizard
The TRUSTe Privacy 
        Wizard was designed to help you create a privacy statement.
The Wizard 
        asks for information such as company name, Web site name and contact information.
The information that is input into the Privacy Wizard is used to generate 
        a privacy statement, however, this information is not saved or captured 
        in any way.
The Wizard directs users to address their inquiries to whoever 
        is entered as Web site administrator.
==========
Further, the privacy statement generated 
        lets users know how they can contact the Web site administrator depending 
        on what information is entered; mailing address, email address, and/or 
        phone number.
Again, this information is not used or captured by TRUSTe.
Links

The TRUSTe Web site contains links to other Web sites.
We encourage you to visit these Web sites to learn more about online privacy.
Please note that these Web sites' privacy policies may differ from those of TRUSTe.
Opt-out Policy
TRUSTe provides its 
        visitors the option of opting-in as opposed to opting-out.
Therefore, 
        when there is a choice of using information for purposes other than what 
        the information was originally collected for, TRUSTe will present the 
        user with an opt-in box.
For example, when visitors go to the "enter 
        the drawing", they are presented with an opt-in box, asking if they 
        would like to receive information about TRUSTe.
==========
By default, the box is 
        NOT checked.
If visitors check the box, a TRUSTe informational package 
        will be emailed to them.
