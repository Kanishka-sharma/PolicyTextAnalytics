As users of the internet, we care about privacy just like you do.
And as fellow human beings, we think you deserve to know exactly what you can expect from your Honey experience.
Before you read our privacy policy, we'd first like to tell you how we think about privacy in simple terms.
We do not sell your personal information.
Ever.
==========
Honey works by finding you the best deals.
When you buy something with a Honey coupon, promo code, or offer, the store sometimes pays us a fee.
That's how we make money.
We do not need to (or want to) sell your information.
==========
So how do we use your data?
First and foremost, we analyze some information on the retail website you're on so that we can look for great coupons for that site or product.
Also, we collect limited shopping data to support the Honey community.
That means Honey members share real-time information about deals, prices, and products with the rest of the community to help everyone save time and money.
==========
Want to know which promo code works?
Sure, another member just tested all of the codes with Honey five minutes ago.
==========
Want to see when a product you're interested in goes on sale?
Another Honey member is helping us update the price right now.
==========
When shoppers hunt for deals together, rather than on their own, everyone can save time and money.
Our stance on privacy is simple: We will be transparent with what data we collect and how we use it to help try and save you time and money, and you can decide if you're good with that.
If this sounds fair, then let's start shopping smarter, together.
P.S.
If you have any questions or comments, you can reach out to us at privacy@joinhoney.com.
