II.
WHAT INFORMATION WE GATHER 
“Personal information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person.
==========
An “identifiable person” is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (such as IP addresses, cookies and other identifiers to the extent that they can be used directly or indirectly – for example by combination with unique identifiers and other information received by Verisign servers to identify a data subject), or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal information about you, which we have grouped together as follows:

Identity Data includes first name, maiden name, last name, user name or similar identifier, marital status, title, job title, company name, date of birth and gender.

Profile Data  includes your user name and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback, survey responses, and any unsolicited personal information not otherwise covered by this Privacy Statement that you choose to submit in an enquiry or webchat, on a blog forum or otherwise on our Covered Sites or in person to a Verisign representative at an event.
Usage Data  includes information about how you use the Covered Websites (for example time of day, duration of visit, pages visited, actions taken on pages) and/or our products and services.
Marketing and Communications Data  includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.
Social Media Application Data  includes, without limitation, your public profile, social media relationships, listed work and education history, listed hometown and current city, profile photos, personal description and “likes”.
==========
Occasionally we collect and process what may be considered sensitive personal information.
Sensitive personal information is a category of personal information which relates to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
==========
For example, we have mentioned above that we may collect certain information made available through Social Media Applications.
This information may contain sensitive personal information.
In addition, the information that you submit in blog forums (or otherwise) on our Covered Sites or by telephone may include sensitive personal information.
We do not collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
We will only process sensitive personal information on the basis that (i) it has manifestly been made public by you, or (ii) the processing is necessary (a) in relation to legal claims, (b) for reasons of substantial public interest, or (c) where we need to carry out certain legal obligations and/or exercise certain rights relating either to Verisign or you.
==========
III.
HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION 
We will only use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws.
Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:

Where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., for the provision of our services or products, the operation of our business or a third party’s business, or the marketing of products or services by us to you in circumstances where you have already bought or subscribed for similar Verisign products or services) and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override our legitimate interests.
==========
Where we need to comply with our legal obligations.
Where we need to perform a contract we have entered into with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.
==========
Insofar as the use relates to sending you marketing communications, where we have your active consent to send you such communications (except where you have bought or subscribed for one or more of our products or services and we market similar products or services to you).
We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:

Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests).
==========
Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes.
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.
Purposes for which we may use your personal information
We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways in which we plan to use your personal information and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so.

==========
Business Transitions
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Verisign decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise businesses or business units in some countries.
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers.
It is Verisign's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
==========
Marketing
We may use your personal information (including cookies – for more information on how we use cookies, please see Section IX below) to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
Where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., for the provision of our services or products, the operation of our business or a third party’s business, or the marketing of products or services by us to you in circumstances where you have already bought or subscribed for similar Verisign products or services) and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override our legitimate interests.
You may receive marketing communications from us if you have purchased products or services from us, we have identified similar products or services that may be relevant for you and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
We will get your express opt-in consent before we market products or services to you that are not similar to products or services you have purchased from us before, or if we share your personal information with any company outside the Verisign group of companies for marketing purposes.
==========
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time.
If you receive a marketing communication from us, the communication will contain an option to opt-out of further communications.
If you receive a marketing communication from one of our business partners, or from social media providers or independent resellers, you should opt out with that entity directly.
You can also contact us at any time to opt out using the details given at the end of this Privacy Statement.

We may disclose personal information for the purposes set out in the table in Section III above.
When we share personal information, we do so in accordance with our data privacy and security requirements.
Below are the parties with whom we may share personal information and why.

==========
All of our employees and contractors are required to follow our data privacy and security policies when handling personal information.
Business Partners and Independent Resellers.
There may be situations in which we provide your personal information to a Verisign business partner or independent reseller so that they can facilitate the provision, support, renewal and/or purchase of Verisign products and services.
Please be assured that these Verisign business partners and independent resellers have agreed to ensure the privacy and security of any transferred information and may only use the shared information to send you information about products or services about which you asked, or for sending updates or providing services on our behalf.

==========
Personal information will be made available to these parties only when necessary to fulfil the services they provide to us, such as software, system and platform support; direct marketing services; cloud hosting services; advertising; data analytics; and order fulfilment and delivery.
Our third-party service providers are not permitted to share or use personal information we make available to them for any purpose other than to provide services to us.
==========

We use third-party service providers located around the world, including outside the EU, to serve the needs of our business, workforce and customers.

We take appropriate steps to ensure that personal information is processed, secured and transferred according to applicable law.
In some cases, we may need to disclose or transfer your personal information within Verisign or to third parties in areas outside of your home country (including areas outside the EU).
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected.
==========
Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.
When we transfer your information to recipients in other countries (such as the U.S.), we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Statement and will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries other than the one in which you provided the information.

As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information.
Our security procedures are subject to at least an annual SOC Type II audit by an internationally recognised accounting firm.
VII.
==========
HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION 
We will only retain your personal information in identifiable form for as long as needed for the purposes for which it is gathered and processed.
In determining retention periods, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
When we no longer need personal information, we either anonymise, securely delete or destroy it.
VIII.

==========
USE OF COOKIES, OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AND GATHERING OF STATISTICAL DATA
In addition to the personal information identified above, we use "cookies" and other statistical and tracking technologies as described in this Section in connection with the operation of our Covered Sites.
A cookie is a piece of information that our Covered Sites send to your browser, which then stores the cookie information on your system.
Other statistical and tracking technologies, such as web beacons, clear gifs, HTTP headers, also work in ways that collect information about your visit and use of our Covered Sites.
We may use both temporary and persistent cookies based on the cookie’s purpose.
==========
Some cookies are deleted when you close down your browser.
These are known as session cookies.
Others remain on your device until they expire or you delete them from your cache.
These are known as persistent cookies and enable us to remember things about you as a returning visitor to our Covered Sites.
==========
We use these technologies in four ways:

To provide a product or service: A cookie may be used to provide you with a specific product or service.
For instance, if you request our Covered Sites to remember your login password or remember your profile in a response to a blog post, we deposit a cookie on your computer to facilitate that request.
==========
If you are logging into an access-controlled section of our Covered Sites, we set a temporary session cookie to establish that you have been authenticated.
The information contained in these cookies consists of random data that is used by our server to authenticate the browser requests to the server for that particular session.
These cookies do not include any type of personal information.
This bit of information is erased when you close the relevant browser window.
==========
If you choose not to accept a temporary cookie, you will not be able to navigate through these online applications.
We also use a cookie when you visit our Covered Sites and request documentation or a response from us.
When you are filling out a form, you may be given the option of having our Covered Sites deliver a cookie to your local hard drive.
==========
You might choose to receive this type of cookie in order to save time when filling out forms and/or revisiting our Covered Sites.
We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have clicked on the box labelled "Please remember my information" or another box with equivalent content when submitting information or communicating with us.
To facilitate website use: If a cookie is used, our Covered Sites will be able to remember information about your preferences and movements either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie.
For instance, we may deposit a cookie to remember which of Verisign’s regional Covered Sites you have selected to access.
==========
Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a website as seamlessly as possible.
If you are accessing our services through one of our online applications, our web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie which is used to help your browser navigate our Covered Sites.
The information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to display when you hit the back button in your browser.
This bit of information is erased when you close the relevant browser window.
==========
To understand our visitors: When you visit our Covered Sites, our systems may automatically collect statistics in aggregate about visitor behaviour.
We may monitor statistics and other data, such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, how users interact with page content and functionality, from which domains our visitors come, which browsers people use and how they move about our Covered Sites.
We use this data about your visit for aggregation purposes only.
These statistics are used to help us to understand our visitors’ interests and improve the content and performance of our Covered Sites.
If you come to our site from one of our business partners, our web server may also send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an origination code for that business partner.
We use this information for statistical and marketing purposes.
==========
We also use a cookie when we track traffic patterns on our Covered Sites.
Analysis of the collected information by our tracking technologies allows us to improve our Covered Sites and the user experience.
If you choose not to accept a persistent cookie, you will still be able to use our Covered Sites.
Even if you choose to receive this type of cookie, you can always set your browser to notify you when you receive any cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it in each situation in which one is sent.
==========
We may supplement this unidentified user data with other data to understand our users better.
For instance, we may relate a user’s IP address to the company to which it relates to better understand our visitors’ interests.
==========
To advertise: We may tailor our advertisements to certain users based on the unidentified user data and related information.
Also, we may receive information on unidentified users’ movements on other websites to tailor advertisements to them on our Covered Sites and, likewise, provide unidentified user information to service providers, such as an ad agency, who places our advertisements on other websites to market to the users who visit them.
You can opt out of this tracking by accessing the link below.
You will need to invoke these opt-out procedures on each computer you use.
If you opt out, you may still see Verisign advertisements on other websites you visit, but these ads are not user specific and are not placed because of your past visits to our Covered Sites.
