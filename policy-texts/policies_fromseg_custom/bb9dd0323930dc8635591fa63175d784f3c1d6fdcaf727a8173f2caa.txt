INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT:
Generally.
When you subscribe to our products or services, we collect personally identifiable information (PII) and Related Information from you.
We also may collect PII and Related Information from you when you contact us about your subscriptions or participate in activities like: forums; message boards; chats; submitting a letter to the editor; creating a community profile; rating, tagging and commenting on articles; or surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or games.
When you visit our web sites, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you.
We do not, however, knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen.
Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, for example via a post card or subscription form.
Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.
When you provide PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about the types of uses we will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
