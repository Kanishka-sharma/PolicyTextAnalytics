ScienceDaily LLC ("ScienceDaily," "we," "us," or "our") provides this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use, and share the information about individuals who visit our website at sciencedaily.com (the "Site").
Information We Collect
Like many websites, ScienceDaily collects information about how Site visitors use the Site in order to operate and improve our services.
For example, we collect information to gather statistics on how many visitors we our Site receives each month, determine the popularity of pages on the Site, and evaluate where there may be problems in serving certain pages to visitors.
When you visit the Site, we (and/or third-party services that we authorize) collect technical information relating to your device and your interactions with the Site -- if it is available -- including IP address, cookie identifiers, Internet service provider, domain name and country of origin of your computer, your operating system, device type, date and time of visit, pages visited and other activities on the Site, the type of web browser being used, and other information collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies.
==========
We collect your email address when you sign up for our newsletters through Google FeedBurner.
We will also collect your email address and any information that you provide if you choose to contact us, such as if you submit feedback.
How We Use Information
ScienceDaily may use the information we collect for any lawful purpose.
We primarily use the information we collect to operate and improve the Site, provide our newsletters, and determine overall statistics about our readership.
Cumulative figures that provide a picture of visitor traffic to our Site are vital in our efforts to attract advertisers -- upon whose support the Site depends -- and to monitor how well our web server is keeping up with our readership.
Please note, however, that ScienceDaily does not attempt to identify its individual visitors about whom ScienceDaily has collected only technical information as described above.
==========
We may also use the information we collect to comply with the law and to maintain the security of the Site.
Finally, we may use the information we collect with your consent, or as otherwise disclosed at the time information is collected.
How We Share Information
We may share the information we collect with other parties, including the following:

With third-party service providers who process data on our behalf, such as email service providers;
With advertising and marketing partners (but we do not share names or email addresses with these partners for their own purposes -- see below for details);
As part of a corporate sale, merger, or acquisition, or other transfer of all or part of our assets, including as part of a bankruptcy proceeding;
Pursuant to a subpoena, court order, governmental inquiry, or other legal process or as otherwise required by law, or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties; and
With your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or sharing.
We may share information that has been de-identified or aggregated without limitation.
==========
Digital Advertising and Analytics
We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers ("Advertising Providers") that serve advertisements on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms.
These Advertising Providers may use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
Information used by Advertising Providers may include location data, if such information is made available based on settings that allow for the collection of such data in your web browser or mobile device.
Some of the advertisements served by Advertising Providers may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices.
This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
You may visit the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Webchoices tool at https://youradchoices.com or the Network Advertising Initiative at https://optout.networkadvertising.org to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in industry self-regulatory programs.
==========
If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through these tools.
Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.
It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, the Site may not function as intended.
Finally, ScienceDaily works with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.
ScienceDaily uses certain third-party services, such as Google Analytics, to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes.
For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use the Site, visit https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites, and you can also opt-out of Google Analytics by using a browser plug-in that Google has developed (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We do not control the privacy practices of those websites or apps, and they are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
You should review the privacy policies of other websites or apps that you use to learn about their data practices.
The Site also includes integrated email newsletter tools and integrated social media tools or "plug-ins" that are offered by third parties.
==========
If you use these tools to share personal information or you otherwise interact with these features on the Site, those companies may collect information about you and may use and share such information in accordance with your account settings, including by sharing such information with the general public.
