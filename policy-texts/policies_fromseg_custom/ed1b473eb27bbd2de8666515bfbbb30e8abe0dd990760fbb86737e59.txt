WHAT IS AD SERVING?In order to support valuable content without charging visitors, websites sell  advertising space on their Web pages or within video content streamed on their  Web pages.
==========
Companies like SpotXchange provide ads to websites and provide  technology for website publishers and advertisers to display or to stream ads.When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a "request"to that  website's server "asking"that server to send you the Web page that you are  seeking.
Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different  sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section  from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements  from other servers.If the website is a Network Site and is using SpotXchange's technology to display  ads on its site, the Web page will contain coding that directs your browser to fill  the ad space on the Web page with content from one of SpotXchange's ad servers.
SpotXchange's platform for streaming video ads enables advertisers to target their  campaigns against particular contextual, geographic, interest or demographic criteria  associated with the website or browser, and bid an amount they are willing to pay  for this targeted impression.
Each time a Network Site queries our platform for an  advertisement, SpotXchange serves the most valuable advertisement to the publisher's  ad slot.
==========
Please note that SpotXchange does not control the privacy policies of the  Network Sites, publishers and advertisers who use our services.2.
COLLECTION AND USE OF AD-SERVING INFORMATIONEach Network Site includes video ad serving code on its website that enables SpotXchange  to serve ads on the site and to place SpotXchange Cookies.
SpotXchange Cookies are used  to help manage ad delivery and frequency, and to identify audience segment(s) for customized  advertising.
SpotXchange does not collect or store any personal identification or sensitive  information, such as your name, address, phone number, address, financial account information,  social security numbers, or health information.The video ads served may include instrumentation tags that enable SpotXchange to collect  information about a personâ€™s interaction with the ad for use in billing and analytical  purposes.
Each time one of SpotXchange's servers receives a request for a video advertisement,  Anonymous Information about the request is recordedâ€”for example, the date and time, the  geographic location of the browser (based on IP address), the website and page to which  the ad or image was delivered, any associated search terms, the SpotXchange Cookie ID,  and the browser operating system.
==========
This information is used for reporting, analytical,  modeling and targeting purposes, and also to better manage ad campaigns and the user  experience, for example, to manage the number of times a particular user is exposed to the  same advertisement.SpotXchange may also make requests to multiple 3rd party data vendors for additional  anonymous user audience information that is used for targeting, analytic and reporting  purposes.
No Personal Information is ever shared by SpotXchange with its 3rd party data  vendors, although the 3rd party data vendors may provide SpotXchange with Anonymous  Information that can be merged with existing Anonymous Information.
SpotXchange only works  with 3rd party data vendors who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)  which sets the industryâ€™s standards for online privacy accountability.SpotXchange also works with approved affiliates for the collection and aggregation of  search terms used for audience modeling and targeting purposes.

Most major  third-party online advertising companies have agreed to provide an opt-out mechanism for  their ad cookies.If you select the opt-out Cookie, ads delivered to your browser on behalf of clients using  our ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the information that is  automatically transmitted in the Internet environment when an ad request is received by  our ad servers (including, your browser type, Internet service provider, information  about the general content of the site or page displayed on your browser and other  non-personally identifiable information provided by the site).
