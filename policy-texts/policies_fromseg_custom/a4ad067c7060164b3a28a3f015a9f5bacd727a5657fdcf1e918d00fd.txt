From Meta, discussion about Wikimedia projects

Note: this is a draft document intended to document the current consensus on the site's implicit privacy policy.
Interested parties are encouraged to edit this page directly or comment in the talk page to help shape an explicit policy.
If you
make an edit here which is not the current practice, please clearly indicate that it is a change and post about it in talk.
It is
not a legal contract, and should not yet be taken as authoritative.
==========
Summary
If you only read the Wikipedia, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in
general.
If you contribute to the Wikipedia, remember that Wikipedia is not a private chat room, not even on "talk" pages, which
suggest by their name that they are transitory.
This is a public place and you are publishing every word you
post.
In a sense, you don't have any privacy here.
You're effectively working in an office where your employer is recording every
conversation you have, anywhere in the office.
==========
If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever.
This includes
articles, "your" user page and "your" talk page.
Some limited exceptions are described below.
==========
Publishing and public data
Simply visiting the web site does not expose your identity publicly (but see private
logging below).
When you edit any page in the wiki, you are publishing a document.
This is a public act, and you are
identified publicly with that edit as its author.
If you are logged in, you will be identified by your user name.
This may be your real name if you so choose, or you may choose
to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name you selected when you created your account.
==========
If you have not logged in, the only identification of the author that we have is your network IP address.
This is a series of four
numbers which identifies the internet address from which you are contacting the wiki.
Depending on your connection, this number
may be traceable only to a large internet service provider, or specifically to your school, place of business, or home.
It may be
possible that the origin of this IP address could be used in conjunction with any interests you express implicitly or explicitly
by editing articles to identify you even by private individuals.
It may be either difficult or easy for a motivated individual to connect your network IP address with your real-life identity.
==========
Therefore if you are very concerned about privacy, you may wish to log in and publish under a pseudonym.
When using a pseudonym,
your IP address will not be available to the public, but it will be stored on the wiki servers for a relatively short amount of
time.
Thus it will be available to developers and may be released under certain circumstances (see below).
If you use a company mail server from home or telecommute and use a DSL or cable internet connection, it's likely to be very
easy for your employer to identify your IP address and find all of your IP based Wikipedia contributions.
Using a user name is a
better way of preserving your privacy in this situation.
Deleting things from the Wikipedia does not really delete them.
==========
In normal articles, anyone can look at a previous version and
see what was there.
If an article is "deleted", any sysop/administrator, meaning almost anyone trusted not to abuse the deletion
capability, can see what was deleted.
Only a developer can permanently delete information from the Wikipedia and this is very
unlikely to be done to protect privacy, except in response to legal action, or, possibly, in cases of harassment, which may
be by a sysop toward another sysop?
.
==========
Private logging
Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server.
Most web servers routinely maintain access
logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites
link to this one, and what web browsers people are using.
It is not the intention of the Wikipedia to use this information to
keep track of legitimate users.
These logs are used to produce the site statistics pages (http://meta.wikipedia.org/stats/); the raw log data is not made public, and is normally discarded
after about two weeks.
==========
Here's a sample of what's logged for one page view:
64.164.82.142 - - [21/Oct/2003:02:03:19 +0000]
"GET /wiki/draft_privacy_policy HTTP/1.1" 200 18084
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump"
"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/85.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.5"

Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems, in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders
that overwhelm the site, or very rarely to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of the
wiki.
Policy on release of data derived from page logs
It is the policy of Wikimedia that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs will not be released by the
developers who have access to it, except as follows:

In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement
With permission of the affected user
To Jimbo Wales, his legal counsel, or his designee, when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints.
Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or
resolve technical issues.
To all curious/interested parties, sometimes except the user concerned, when it is believed that an IP address may be
associated with a banned or otherwise abusive contributor, as part of the process of trying to determine whether this is in fact
the case.
==========
because this has been done in the past - not sure if it will be in the future...

Wikimedia policy does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described
above.
Policy regarding log retention
It is the policy of Wikimedia that server log information, including any backup copies, is destroyed within one year of its
creation.
Will this be retained longer for abuse/security issues or at the request of law enforcement?
==========
E-mail
You may optionally provide your e-mail address to associate with your account.
Other logged-in users may send e-mail to you
through the wiki (unless you disable this in your preferences), but your address will not be revealed to them unless you respond.
[Or perhaps if the mail bounces, need to check this.]
If you do not wish to provide an address you do not have to, but
you will then not be able to reset your password if you lose it.
If you subscribe to one of the project mailing lists (http://mail.wikipedia.org/), your
address will be exposed to any other subscriber.
The list archives are public, and your address may find itself quoted in
messages.
==========
Cookies
The wiki will set a temporary session cookie (PHPSESSID) whenever you visit the site.
If you do not intend to ever log in, you
may deny this cookie, but you cannot log in without it.
It will be deleted when you close your browser session.
More cookies may be set when you log in, to avoid typing in your user name (or optionally password) on your next visit.
These
last up to 30 days.
You may clear these cookies after use if you are using a public machine and don't wish to expose your
username to future users of the machine.
(If so, clear the browser cache as well.)
==========
Right to Vanish
If you have used your real name, or a longstanding pen name, on Wikipedia then in principle everything you write can be traced
to that name, and thus to you, as discussed above.
However, if you decide to leave Wikipedia, there are a few steps that you can
take to weaken that connection.
They are:

Change your username to some other name, one which is not directly associated with you (contact a developer).
Change references to your former username to be references to your replacement username (you can do this yourself).
Delete your user and user talk subpages (contact an administrator).
==========
Replace your user page with a brief note indicating that you have left Wikipedia, and asking that people not refer to you by
your name.
You should note that while these measures afford a degree of practical obscurity, they will not stand up to assault from a persistent
investigator, and Wikipedia has no control over its sublicensees, or over archiving services such as the Internet Archive or
google.
Further, these actions require a degree of co-operation from Wikipedia users, so Wikipedia cannot make guarantees on this
matter.
However, a few Wikipedians have taken advantage of these kinds of measures in the past, and appear content with the
results.

vanish (meatballwiki)

Personal information deletion
The Wikipedia will delete personal information about contributors (most likely on on user and user talk pages) at their
request, provided it is not needed for administrative reasons (which is generally limited to dealing with site misuse issues).
Personal information about those who merit an encyclopedia article, when in the encyclopedia article, is not included in this.
Personal information typically includes, but is not limited to, name, address, telephone number, instant messenger contact
details, photograph, appearance, food tastes, political views and similar details of an individual person.
==========
Multiple accounts
It is possible to create multiple Wikipedia accounts.
While there may be some valid reasons to do so, in general the practice
is discouraged as sock puppetry - that is, the attempt to unfairly influence the discussion amongst the Wikipedia
community by attempting to create the false impression that more users share a particular opinion.
This is especially a concern
if more than one identity of a person votes on a particular discussion.
==========
Passwords
Many aspects of the Wikipedia community interactions depend on the reputation and respect that is built up through a history
of valued contributions.
User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user's edit history.
All users are
encouraged to select strong passwords and to never share them.
No one shall knowingly expose the password of another user to
public release either directly or indirectly.
