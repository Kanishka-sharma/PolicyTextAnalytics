Federal 
                    Trade Commission Privacy Policy
This page describes how the FTC handles 
                    information that we learn about consumers when consumers visit 
                    the Web sites we operate (www.ftc.gov, 
                    www.consumer.gov, 
                    www.econsumer.gov, 
                    www.donotcall.gov 
                    ) or contact us by mail, phone, or email.
We collect the 
                    information under the authority of the FTC 
                    Act and other laws we enforce or administer, 
                    and we maintain it in accordance with the Privacy 
                    Act of 1974, where applicable.
Any personally 
                    identifying information you provide is voluntary.
We use it 
                    to fulfill a request you make or to assist us in carrying 
                    out our mission; it may be disclosed to others for such purposes.
If 
                    you visit our Web sites to browse, read, or download information:

 We automatically collect and store: the name of the domain 
                      and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet 
                      protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the 
                      browser software you use and your operating system; the 
                      date and time you access our sites; and the Internet address 
                      of the site from which you linked directly to our sites.
We use this information only as anonymous aggregate data 
                      to determine the number of visitors to different sections 
                      of our sites, to ensure the sites are working properly, 
                      and to help us make our sites more useful.
==========
We do not use 
                      it to track or record information about individuals.
Generally, 
                      we delete this information after one year.
We do not use persistent "cookies" 
                      or tracking mechanisms that collect personally identifying 
                      information on our sites.
Our Do Not Call Web site (www.donotcall.gov) 
                      uses session cookies to anonymously collect a visitorâ€™s 
                      IP address and the date and time of the visit.
Session cookies 
                      are temporary files that are erased when you close all browsers.
We use these session cookies for site management purposes.
Accepting session cookies on our Do Not Call Web site is 
                      voluntary; you may still use the site if you decline cookies.

Information 
                    We Collect

 We collect any personally identifying information, such 
                      as your name, street address, email address, and phone number, 
                      and any other information you provide to us.
In accordance with the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
                      (COPPA), when a visitor files a complaint online 
                      and indicates an age under 13, no personally identifying 
                      information is collected in conjunction with that submission.
How We Use and 
                    Disclose Information
 If you choose to provide personally 
                    identifying information to us, we will use and disclose it 
                    as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you do not provide 
                    your name or other identifying information, it may be impossible 
                    for us to refer, respond to, or investigate your complaint 
                    or request.
We may share your information with contractors 
                    acting on our behalf, such as call center operators and redress 
                    administrators, who are subject to confidentiality agreements.
If you contact us to order publications, 
                      we use the information you provide to fulfill your order 
                      or contact you about your order.
==========
If you contact us to complain 
                      about a company, individual, or a particular practice, or 
                      to report that you have been a victim of identity theft: 
                      



 We make your complaint available to FTC employees 
                          involved in law enforcement.
We may share your complaint with a variety of government 
                          agencies worldwide that enforce consumer protection, 
                          competition, and other laws.
We may share your complaint with certain private 
                          entities, including companies you may have complained 
                          about, to help address your complaint.
If your complaint 
                          concerns identity theft or the accuracy of your credit 
                          report, we may share it with credit bureaus to help 
                          address your complaint or identity theft-related concern.
When you submit a complaint, you may be contacted 
                          by the FTC, other law enforcement agencies, or any of 
                          the private entities to which your complaint has been 
                          referred.

If you contact us by phone to 
                      be included in the National 
                      Do Not Call Registry, we will collect your 
                      phone number and store it in the registry so that telemarketers 
                      and sellers covered by the FTC's rules can remove your phone 
                      number from their call lists.
If you contact us via the 
                      Internet, we also collect your email address to confirm 
                      your registration request.
We will store your email address 
                      in a secure manner, separate from your telephone number.
We will not share your email address with telemarketers.
Telemarketers are required to search the registry every 
                      three months and delete from their call lists phone numbers 
                      that are in the registry.
Phone numbers in the registry 
                      may also be shared with law enforcement to assure compliance 
                      with federal and state law.

                      we may be required or authorized by law to disclose the 
                      information you provide.

                    may be in our records:

Cookie
A "cookie" is a small text file that a Web 
                    site can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for 
                    example, to collect information about your activities on the 
                    site or to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping 
                    cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase.
The cookie 
                    transmits this information back to the Web site's computer 
                    which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read 
                    it.
Many consumers do not know that "cookies" are being placed 
                    on their computers when they visit Web sites.
If you want 
                    to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, 
                    you can set your browser to warn you when a Web site attempts 
                    to place a "cookie" on your computer.
