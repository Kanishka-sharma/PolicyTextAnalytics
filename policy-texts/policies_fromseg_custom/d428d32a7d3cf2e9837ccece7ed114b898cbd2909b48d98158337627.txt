1- Criteo services

Criteo is a specialist in creating personalized advertisements.
We work with online partners to build advertisements for their website visitors or prospects and with publishers to display personalized advertisements.
Our aim is to deliver advertisements by displaying products and/or personalized banners that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing behavior.
==========
In particular terms, you visit and browse on Website A and, on a subsequent online visit to Website B, you will see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website A.

With our service, you should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Criteo.
2- Our technology

Criteo “tags” visitors to its partners' websites with anonymous browser cookies.
Users tagged by Criteo are given an anonymous identifier.
At no point does Criteo collect personal data, such as your name or address.
The browser cookies track the products viewed by the visitor and pages visited of the partner for whom Criteo is delivering ads.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

events related to your activity on the partner’s website (such as the number of pages viewed, the products you viewed on that website, your searches made on the partner's website) 
information provided by trusted partners that may include socio-demographic data such as age range,
and events related to the Criteo ad serving activity such as the number of ads displayed to you.
We do know that the internet browser you are using has visited one of our partner sites in the last thirty days.
We do not know who you are.
We do not know your address, your place of work, your date of birth, your email address or any other personally identifiable information about you.
==========

We do not collect sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health...).
The cookie information collected aims to increase the relevancy of the ads being displayed to you.
The data we collect is also used for reporting purposes, to give our clients and partners more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns, and to improve performance over time.

We do not process any information which could be used by Criteo, directly or indirectly, with the help of a third party or otherwise, to determine the identity of users.
We do not share any information collected with third parties except with our subsidiaries or affiliated companies.
*In compliance with the best industry standards, we use IP addresses for fraud detection purposes (and not for targeting purposes) to help alert us to situations which could not have been caused by human behaviour, such as a massive amount of clicking in a limited period of time.
