  Policy
  Overview
 
  AmericanGreetings.com is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers  
  of its interactive products and services.
Throughout cyberspace, we want to  
  contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers.
The purpose of this AmericanGreetings.com privacy policy is to inform you, as  
  a welcome visitor what kinds of information we may gather about you when you  
  visit AmericanGreetings.com.
We also want to tell you how we may use that information,  
  whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use  
  of, and your ability to correct, the information.
Finally, please note that  
  this policy applies only to AmericanGreetings.com and not to other companies'  
  or organizations' Web sites to which we link.
Information About All AmericanGreetings.com Visitors  
  In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like  
  the numbers and frequency of visitors to AmericanGreetings.com and its areas,  
  very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned  
  in to a program.
==========
We only use such data in aggregate.
This collective data helps  
  us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve  
  our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of  
  you as possible.
For example, AmericanGreetings.com uses a technology nicknamed "cookies."
We  
  may track your visit to our site by giving you a cookie when you enter.
Cookies  
  are pieces of information sent to your browser from a web server and stored  
  on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Americangreetings.com  
  uses cookies to make visiting our site easier.
==========
Cookies allow us to save passwords  
  for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
If you prefer, you can  
  reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to

  collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information  
  collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to

An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you are using your  
  browser on the Internet.
We log this information, but this information is never  
  linked to any personally identifying information.
It is used to audit the number  
  of visitors coming to our web site.
We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about  
  you personally, to our AmericanGreetings.com partners about how our members,  
  collectively, use AmericanGreetings.com.

  how often people use their areas of our site in order for them to provide you  
  with the best possible Web experience as well.

We may also use that information  
  to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be  
  interested.
Choice/Opt-out 
  You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want by letting  
  us know on the registration page when you sign up for the product or service.
==========
You will also be given the option to opt-out every time you receive promotional  
  communications from AMERICANGREETING.COM.
From time to time we may ask you for  
  information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage
