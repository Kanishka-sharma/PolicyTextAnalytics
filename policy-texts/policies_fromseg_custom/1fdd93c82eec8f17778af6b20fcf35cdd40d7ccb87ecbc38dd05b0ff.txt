PRIVACY POLICY


The purpose of the Pandora Privacy Policy is to inform our listeners about the information that Pandora collects, how Pandora uses that information and how listeners can control how that information is used or shared.
To make it a bit easier to digest our Privacy Policy, we want to highlight some key issues to keep in mind about our data collection and use practices.
For information about listeners' obligations and use of Pandora, please see our Terms of Use.
You have significant control over the information that is shared with other Pandora users and the public through the privacy settings for your profile.
We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their marketing purposes.
Post wisely: Information that you post in our community and social networking features is available to members of the public.
We use the information that we collect and you provide about yourself to personalize your Pandora experience through ads and social networking features.

We track the music played on Pandora so that we can make sure artists and copyright owners get paid.
We must report on listening in aggregate to music licensing agencies.
These reports do not contain individual listener data.
Your stations are always available to the public; however, if you make your profile private, your profile will not be linked to your station list.
Members of the public who enter your email address into our search system may be able to see information about your stations and to listen to them.

This summary is not the complete picture, so please read the Pandora Privacy Policy below in its entirety to learn more about the information that Pandora collects, how Pandora uses and shares this information, and your options to control how that information is used or shared.

Automatic Data Collection
Copyright Tracking: Pandora incorporates software that is designed to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to and to ensure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties.
This software identifies and counts the songs you have accessed.

Tracking technology: We use what are commonly called "cookies," a small data string our server writes to your hard drive, and other tracking technology (such as Flash Persistent Storage) to help us manage and track your interaction with Pandora Services.
These technologies collect non-personally identifiable information to improve Pandora Services to keep count of return visits to our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, save your password and login information, and / or display advertising or content based on your interests.
We may also capture other data such as search criteria and results, date, time, connection speed and IP addresses.
