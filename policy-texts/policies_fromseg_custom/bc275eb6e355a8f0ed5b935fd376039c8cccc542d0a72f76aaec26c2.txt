Travelzoo's Privacy Practices 
Travelzoo Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Travelzoo's Web sites.
==========
Travelzoo publishes various e-mail newsletters.
Users can sign up for newsletters from our home page by providing their e-mail address, country and zip code.
This information will not be shared with third parties.
Recipients can edit their personal information or manage newsletter subscriptions by visiting the edit profile page.
Information on how to unsubscribe is also included in every newsletter.
==========
Travelzoo uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.
The cookie is a small text file that resides on your hard drive.
It is used to retrieve stored information that you knowingly provided us such as name, e-mail address and zip code in order to personalize your use of Travelzoo's Web sites.
Travelzoo also works with third parties with whom we have a service agreement ("Service Providers")  who use cookies to aid in the reporting of aggregate site usage statistics for Travelzoo's Web sites.
Such statistics are not linked to personally identifiable information.
==========
Some Travelzoo advertisers use "view-through" pixels to track the effectiveness of the promotions they run on Travelzoo.
Such pixels lead to cookies being placed on your computer by these advertisers.
Travelzoo does not have control over these 3rd party cookies, and cannot access any personally identifiable information about you as a result of these cookies.
Travelzoo tracks individual user response (clicks) on offers on its Web sites.
This information is used to better customize content and advertising for you in the future.
Individual user click behavior is not shared with third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
==========
Travelzoo reserves the right to send you certain communications relating to Travelzoo's service or products, including administrative messages, market research surveys, and periodic product announcements associated with your newsletter or e-mail product subscription(s), as long as you remain a subscriber to one of our newsletters or e-mail products.
Your voluntary response to market research surveys may be used to improve our products and services and for anonymous, aggregate reporting for internal and external clients.
From time to time Travelzoo announces voluntary promotional programs which include promotional incentives for subscribers.
These programs usually require personally identifiable information (ex: name, mailing address or frequent flyer account numbers) to be submitted for those subscribers who wish to participate.
This information is then shared, upon the explicit opt-in of the subscriber, with external third parties for the purpose of fulfilling the promotional components of the program, for example with an airline for the awarding of frequent flyer miles to a subscriber's account.
Subscribers who do not wish this information to be disclosed to third parties may decline participation in these optional programs.
Any promotional program which includes the sharing of information with a third party will have such a disclosure clearly described in the program's description and rules.
==========
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.
IP addresses are associated with your e-mail address and other personally identifiable information for the purpose of documenting that you explicitly signed up (opted-in) for our e-mail newsletters.
In order to provide our users a seamless experience, some pages on our site may be hosted by Service Providers.
==========
For example, much of our Investor Relations section is powered by Shareholder.com.
When you sign up for investor-related e-mail alerts, you are actually entering your information directly with Shareholder.com so that they can provide the requested service for you on our behalf.
Service Providers are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose other than for fulfilling the service you requested.
The Site includes a Service Center for Travelzoo shareholders.
==========
This section is password-protected.
The features allow shareholders to update their contact information (e-mail address and mailing address).
This information will not be shared with third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
Advertising customers can contact advertising sales by filling out an online form.
This form asks for name, company name, phone, fax, and e-mail.
This is an optional feature to help us initially contact interested advertising customers, and as such the information cannot be automatically updated once submitted.
This information will not be shared with any third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
==========
Travelzoo has security measures in place to protect user information under our company's control against loss, misuse, or alteration.
Access to private and confidential data is limited to only those employees with a specific need to retrieve this information.
Data is stored on multiple server systems and written to tapes.
All server systems are located in a secure, limited access Class A facility complete with environmentally controlled conditions, raised floors, and dry sprinkler systems.
==========

Please be aware that Travelzoo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
Travelzoo encourages our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
Travelzoo reserves the right to add to or modify this Policy simply by posting such addition or modification on the Travelzoo Web site.
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail or via a prominent notice on our site.
