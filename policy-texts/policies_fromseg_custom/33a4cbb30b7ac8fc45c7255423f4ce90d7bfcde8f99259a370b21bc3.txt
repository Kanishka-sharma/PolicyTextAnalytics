Our privacy policy is clear: 
 We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to 
 provide that information to us.
Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website: 


 White House Internet Security Policy


 For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government 
 computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to

==========
Information Collected and Stored Automatically


 If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we 
 will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically.
This information does not  
 identify you personally.
We automatically collect and store only the following information about 
 your visit:
 

   The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or 
   "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that 
   is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website; 
  

   The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
  

   The date and time you access our site; 
  

   The pages you visit; and
  

   If you linked to the White House website from another website, the address of that website.
We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors -- to learn about the number of 
 visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use.
We do not track or record information 
 about individuals and their visits.
==========
If You Send Us Personal Information


 If you choose to provide us with personal information by sending an e-mail to the President or someone else 
 in the White House, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our 
 website, 
 we use that information to respond to your message and to help us provide
 you with information that you request.
If you submit your resume through our website, we use your personal identification information only in considering your application for employment.
We do not collect personal information for any other purposes.
The information you provide is not given to any private organizations or private persons.
The White House does not collect or use information for commercial marketing.
==========
We would share your e-mail with another federal government agency only if your inquiry related to that 
 agency or if we were required to do so by law.
The 
 Presidential Records Act 
 requires us to maintain some documents, including e-mails, received by the White House and requires public 
 disclosure of some of these documents twelve years after President Bush leaves office.
In addition, we 
 would release documents, including e-mails, if required to do so by a congressional or judicial subpoena.
If you submit resume information through the Presidential Personnel Application, 
 this information will be shared only with White House employees involved in making hiring decisions and, if you 
 express interest in employment with a federal executive agency other than the White House, with officials 
 responsible for making hiring decisions in that agency.
We are required by the Presidential Records Act to 
 maintain your resume as a record, but your personal resume information is not subject to public disclosure under 
 the Act.
==========
Links to Other Sites


 Our website has links to the websites of many other federal agencies.
In a few cases, we link to private 
 organizations, with their permission.
Before leaving the White House website, a page will appear informing you 
 that you are leaving our server.
Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the 
 new site.
