What privacy policy rules apply when I "click" over to other web sites?
AARP.org includes links to other Web sites, some of which are operated by AARP Service Providers or approved vendors, and some of which are not.
Sites operated by AARP Service Providers and approved vendors may also collect personal information, and may have their own privacy policies that differ from, and are not covered by, this privacy policy.
It is important that you review any privacy policies on these sites carefully before you use any services or programs offered.
==========
When you click to unaffiliated third-party sites, AARP is not responsible for, and has no control over, the information collection or privacy practices of that site.
It is important that you review and understand the privacy policies posted on any linked sites you visit before volunteering any of your personal information.
These sites may also collect cookies, or allow third-party advertisers on their sites to collect cookies.
==========
You can often find information regarding a site and its privacy policy on the site's home page.
If you cannot find or do not like a site's privacy policy, you may prefer not to do business with, or offer information to, that site.

Do privacy protections exist in AARP's Online Community?
It is important to understand that the information you submit in personal profiles, message boards, journals, chat rooms, and user groups is publicly displayed.
Your messages will be seen by people and organizations not related to AARP, and may be used by these third parties to contact you.
==========
As a result, you should be very careful about the information that you publish online.
Because these unrelated parties will also see your "User Name" on any postings that you make in online discussions, you may not want to use your full name.
You can use your first name only, or use an assumed name, if you like.

How does AARP.org protect security and confidentiality?
In order to protect your personal information, we use technologies and processes such as encryption, access control procedures, network firewalls, physical security, and other measures.
These measures increase the security and privacy of information traveling to, from, and within AARP.org.
==========
Only our authorized employees or agents carrying out permitted business functions are allowed to access personal information.
Employees who violate our privacy access policies may be subject to disciplinary actions, including termination when appropriate.
In order to interact with AARP.org, we require you to use a password to protect your account from unauthorized access by others.
If you do allow others, including family or household members, to access AARP members-only services through your personal password or to use your membership account number, please understand that you are responsible for the actions of those individuals.
==========
This privacy policy describes the types of information we currently collect, and the ways we use and protect that information.
If you are uncomfortable with our policies and practices, please do not provide any personal information to us through AARP.org.
From time to time, we may collect different types of information and use that information in different waysâ€”for example, when we add features or services to AARP.org.
==========
In these cases, we may edit this policy to explain the new practices.
Because protecting members' privacy is very important to us, we do not expect major changes in policy.
However, if we do make significant changes in our practices, we will include announcements on the AARP.org home page so that you will know to review the revised policy.
