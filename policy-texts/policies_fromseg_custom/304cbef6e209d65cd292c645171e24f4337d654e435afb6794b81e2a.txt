We may use cookies to:

provide you with access to services that require you to be a logged-in, registered user (for example, our premium content service);

prevent you from voting or submitting results more than once in a poll, survey, or competition;
keep you logged in to our site throughout a session so that you do not have to log in repeatedly;

The information we gather by use of cookies may include personally identifying information; if you do not wish to accept this, you can manage cookies via your browser.
Some of our third-party partners - for example advertisers - may also serve cookies to you via our site.

From time to time we provide aggregate statistical information to our advertisers and other partners, typically regarding website usage patterns.

Email newsletters
Our email newsletters include a small transparent image, or 'beacon', that lets us know whether or not the emails we send out are being opened.
This helps us to improve the service we offer, contact you about changes to your newsletter subscriptions and provide aggregated statistical information to advertisers about readership levels.
By downloading images when you open the newsletter you will activate the beacon; if you do not wish to do this you can choose either not to download images in emails from us, or to receive all emails as plain text, by amending the settings and rules within your email client.
However, this will also mean that you will be unable to see any pictorial or multimedia content contained within the newsletters

You have the right to be told what personal information we hold about you on our databases.
You should write to us, Reedbusiness.co.uk Update.net at Reed Business Information, Quadrant House, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 5AS, UK stating your full name, your address and all publications or services from RBI to which you know you subscribe.
A small administrative charge will be made for fulfilling this request.
