 We may be legally required to disclose personally identifiable information, for instance in order to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal processes, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend ourselves against legal claims
 It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including -- without limitation -- fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of
                eSnips
                ’ terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.

                eSnips
              is acquired by another company or merges with another company (a situation which will probably but not necessarily result in your information becoming subject to a different privacy policy).
In this event,
              eSnips
              will notify all users by email or by putting a prominent notice on the
              eSnips
