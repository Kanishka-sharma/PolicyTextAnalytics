You are solely responsible for all telephone charges incurred by your use of the Juno Services and Juno will not reimburse you for any such charges.
Certain Juno Services require, but do not include, Internet access and you are responsible for obtaining, at your own expense, such access from Juno or another provider.
2.4.
==========
You expressly permit and authorize Juno and its affiliates (and such third parties as may be authorized by Juno, subject to the Privacy Statement) to furnish you, electronically when you use the Services or by any other means selected by Juno, information or materials prepared by Juno or by (or on behalf of) other entities, including advertising information, solicitations and software downloads.
You acknowledge that any such information, advertisements, solicitations and downloads are an inseparable part of the Services, and you understand and agree that the furnishing of such information, advertisements, solicitations and downloads to you cannot be terminated unless the Services are also terminated.
Some third parties furnishing you with advertisements and solicitations through the Services may permit you to "opt out" of receiving such communications from them, in which case you can do so by following the instructions they provide.
However, Juno is not responsible for any such party's failure to comply with its own "opt out" policies, nor does Juno endorse the views or content of any third party advertisements or solicitations.
All such advertisements and solicitations will be understood to be requested by you through the act of using the Services, and each time you use your account reaffirms such request.
Juno's policies relating to privacy and the collection and use of subscriber information are set forth in the Privacy Statement, which forms an integral part of this Agreement.

These may include, among others, the maximum number of days that unread e-mail messages will be retained by the Services, the maximum number of e-mail messages that may be sent from or received by an account on the Services, the maximum size of any e-mail message or attachment that may be sent from or received by an account on the Services, the maximum disk space that will be allocated on Juno's servers on a subscriber's behalf, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) a subscriber may access the applicable Service in a given period of time.
The Juno e-mail service and network including, without limitation, e-mail addresses, is owned by Juno.
E-mail in inactive or terminated accounts may be deleted in accordance with Juno's policies.
You agree to use Juno e-mail services only to send and receive personal messages.
Juno prohibits unsolicited e-mail to be sent or received through the Services, and uses a variety of techniques to eliminate or minimize e-mail or attachments that Juno believes are unsolicited, inappropriate or harmful.
In doing so, Juno may block or delete e-mail or attachments sent by you or to you, even though such e-mail or attachments may not be unsolicited, inappropriate or harmful.
==========
You understand that unless otherwise specified in your service level or plan terms, Juno does not utilize anti-virus software or services to scan for viruses.
If your service level or plan terms do include anti-virus software or services, you understand that that not all viruses can be detected and/or cleaned.
==========
You are responsible for any damages caused by your decision to download any e-mail or attachments.
You agree that Juno is not responsible for any e-mail or attachments that are blocked or deleted for any reason and that you have no right, and Juno has no obligation, to retrieve or access any such deleted or blocked e-mail or attachments.
You further agree that Juno is not responsible for any e-mail or attachments that it fails to block or delete, even if such e-mail or attachments contain viruses or are otherwise harmful to your computer.
Without limiting the generality of Juno's rights as set forth in this Agreement, Juno reserves the right to change your e-mail address and associated member ID if, in Juno's sole discretion, it is inappropriate or infringes on the rights of a third party.
==========
You acknowledge that Juno may implement prioritization practices in connection with accessing certain internet access Services and that your ability to establish and maintain a connection to the applicable Service may be limited, in connection with such practices or otherwise.
You acknowledge that any limits Juno establishes may differ for different portions of the Services, and in particular may be set at different levels for subscribers based on factors determined in Juno's sole discretion, which may or may not include, among others, a subscriber's chosen service level, specific usage patterns, geographic location, the particular telecommunications carrier through which a connection to the Services are attempted or established, and/or a subscriber's participation in certain programs designed to generate revenues for Juno.
You acknowledge that Juno may restrict, limit or require the use of third party software or services in connection with the Services.
You also acknowledge that Juno reserves the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice.

By posting, uploading or transmitting material to any public area, you (i) grant to Juno and/or its partners a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license (including the waiver of any moral rights) to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, display, and create derivative works from, such material (in whole or in part) and to incorporate it into other works in any form, media or technology (whether now known or later developed) and (ii) warrant that the owner of any rights in the material, including intellectual property and moral rights, has waived such rights and has given you the right to grant the license described above.
