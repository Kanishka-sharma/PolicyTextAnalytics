'Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works,' the company wrote.
In an effort to gain back user trust and quell the #DeleteFacebook movement spurred by the Cambridge Analytica data leak, Facebook on Wednesday introduced new privacy tools and promised to make its existing ones easier to find in the coming weeks.
"Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data," Facebook VPs Erin Egan and Ashlie Beringer wrote in a blog post.
"We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed."
For starters, the social network has redesigned the settings menu on mobile devices to, hopefully, make it easier to manage your account and see what type of data apps connected to it are accessing.
These settings were previously spread out across almost 20 different screens; going forward, they will be accessible from one.
Also on tap is a new Privacy Shortcuts menu, which will let you "control your data in just a few taps," Egan and Beringer wrote.

From there, you'll be able to enable two-factor authentication, review and delete things you've shared on the platform, tweak your ad preferences, and manage who sees your posts and profile information.
The social network also today introduced a tool called "Access Your Information," which will let you review your posts, reactions, comments, and things you've searched for, then delete anything you no longer want on your profile or the platform.

Facebook is also planning to make it easier to download a copy of all the data you've shared with the company.
That data includes photos you've uploaded, contacts you've added to your account, posts on your timeline, and more.

Finally, expect some changes to Facebook's terms of service and data policy in the near future.

The changes are intended to "better spell out what data we collect and how we use it," Egan and Beringer wrote, adding that this is "about transparency â€“ not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data."
The new measures come after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week pledged to investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of user data before Facebook changed its rules in 2014, and further restrict current developers' access to data.
