Bottom line: We know that almost no one reads those 10 page TOS guidelines, so we'll make this short and sweet...

You're free to put up anything with a genuine purpose and does not hurt anyone by it's nature.
Other than that you are PROHIBITED from putting any content that's related to the following: (If found, our staff & fraud scripts will FIND AND REMOVE THEM INSTANTLY.)
==========
Phishing of any site -- especially MySpace, eBay, PayPal, Live ID and banks.
This is when scammer creates a fake company site that looks real.
And tricks unsuspecting visitors to enter their username/password, in hopes of obtaining their personal info like credit card.
==========
Using your domain to spam other sites.
Do you like getting spam?
Nope.
Does the next person you're targeting?
Nope.
Then don't do it!
This includes spam via email or including your USERNAME.110mb.com in unsolicited emails (risking 110mb getting blacklisted).
==========
Hosting Proxy  Scripts (like PHProxy).
These are scripts that allow a visitor to enter any domain through your site, and the domain won't pickup the visitors true I.P. address.
==========
They are way too CPU resource intensive.
Loading your  account page(s) from another site with an IFRAME.
EG: <iframe src="http://USERNAME.110mb.com/mypage.htm"></iframe>
This is blatantly stealing server resources.
==========
Same like me secretly leeching 10% of your weekly salary!
Bots find these accounts via referrer logs and delete them instantly.
==========
Creating Doorway Pages (eg using Doorway Page Generator PRO) 



Yea and you think we don't know about infested-muffified-sheep who create these keyword stuffed redirect pages, that damage our status & waste visitors time.
These pages are easily found using an algorithm and removed automatically.
==========
Hosting Torrent Scripts (like TorrentFlux, SendSpace, RapidLeech).
This is when torrents are downloaded to 110mb servers and you later on download it to your PC.
Torrents rape & scrape the hard-drives and greatly shorten their lifespan.
==========
Hosting Torrent Trackers (like Azureus, BitComet, BitTornado, Shareaza).
Torrent Trackers are one of the most CPU consuming scripts alive!
==========
And 110mb must pay hundreds for monthly  bandwidth to support the selfish clowns using them.
Using your account mainly for file storage of images, videos or music.
110mb is  a text  content provider.
==========
It's not a place to mainly  backup/store your files.
Because uploading/download large files needs the  hard drive head to move a lot.
==========
Hence reducing their life span, and decreasing I/O performance for everyone.
For media/file storage see this file hosting directory.
Hosting Radio Blogs.
Not allowed for same reason as above point.
==========
These imply you'll be hosting tons of music files on your account.
Hosting  scripts that constantly write data to MySQL usually by tracking something.
These includes examples: OpenX, Adsense trackers & site indexers/spiders.
==========
Because this activity constantly needs the hard drive head to move in order to write/read the new data.
And this activity shortens hard drive life-span.
==========
Hosting Chat Rooms (or) IRC bots.
Most paid hosting providers don't even allow this due to  scripts nature to kill system resources.
==========
If found, account is deleted and the next day you'll fall in a sewage hole.
Hosting  your own PHP file manager.
Using your own file manager (to upload, delete, etc..
.
files) puts a security risk on the network.
Hence not allowed.
==========
Yes we're also talking about c99 hack type of scripts.
Sales or promotion of beer, hard alcohol, tobacco or drugs.
This especially includes pharmaceutical medicines and stimulators like Viagra and Cialis.
==========
Because these are usually spam pages, and pose legal threats to 110mb incase the drug sends the buyer to space (nice name for death).
Using copyright content without  permission or storing   illegal files on your account.
Includes software/cracks/scripts.
These infringe the copyrights of the authors or companies and disrespect their hard work, labour & time.
You wouldn't like your stuff being distributed or sold online without your permission.
So don't do it to others.
==========
Child porn.
(This is UNrelated to adult porn material, which is ALLOWED.)
This is porn under 18.
It's a no-no bigtime!
==========
Having incorrect/garbage name or address filed on your account.
Eg: A name like "Aaadfdf Ffdfsf" or address like "44444444 Ptrc Rd".
==========
This tells us that you have not read our TOS and don't respect the service.
Not having a homepage in your root folder-- or still having original 'Account Created' page 15+ days of your signup date.
==========
Also includes not having a proper website while having uploaded tons of files to your account, hence using your account mainly for file storage, which is not allowed.
Q: Are porn/adult sites allowed?
A: Yes they are totally allowed.
==========
With exception of having an intention to use 110mb as a redirecting agent to another site.
IE: When they land on your keyword spammed 110mb page -- they  get redirected to another site.
Also child porn (naked humans under 18) is prohibited.
Q: Am I allowed to host an image hosting script (like imageshack.us) where it allows my visitors to upload their images?
A: No.
==========
Because you'll be violating above TOS point of using account mainly as file storage medium, where the site contains no "real" content.
Q: Am I allowed to offer business opportunities or sell products or turn my site  for money-making purposes (including placing ads like Adsense, YPN, etc..
.)
?
==========
A: Of course you can.
Q: Is my personal info safe with you?
Are you going to sell my email address?
==========
A: You've gotta be kidding!
People are so busy running their life's that the last thing  you, we or anyone wants is worries to stop leaking  personal info to anyone, which will likely be used for spam.
==========
Your privacy is totally respected with ZERO interest now or the future to reveal your details to anyone.
Q: Will my site ever get deleted?
==========
