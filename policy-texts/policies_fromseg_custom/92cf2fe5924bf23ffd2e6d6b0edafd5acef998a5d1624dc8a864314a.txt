Payment Services Agreement
As explained in section 6 of the Square User Agreement that you have previously accepted, Square processes payment transactions in accordance with agreements with entities called payment processors (“Processors”) and payment card networks (“Networks”) including MasterCard International Inc. and Visa USA, Inc.
This Agreement constitutes your agreement with Square enabling Square and the Processors to facilitate your payments as your master merchant of record.
In order to enable Square’s payment processing services for your Square Account, Square may perform underwriting of your application.
In connection with such underwriting and ongoing maintenance of your Account, you agree that Square may share information about you and your Account(s).
==========
Each signer of this Agreement authorizes Square to obtain credit bureau reports on such person in connection with your request for a Square Account and, further, if a Square Account is opened, Square may obtain additional credit bureau reports from time to time for the purpose of determining whether such signer or the Account holder continues to meet the requirements for the Square Account.
You authorize and direct Square to share information about you regarding your application (including whether you are approved or declined) with each other, and if you are approved, information about your Account and its transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes and/or for use in connection with the management and maintenance of the program, including to create and update their customer records about you and to assist them in better serving you.
==========
Managing your Square Account

1.
Your Square Account
Your Square Account permits you to receive payments.
Individuals and businesses may register for Square Accounts.
==========
You confirm that you are either a legal resident of the United States, a United States citizen or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the state in which it operates.
The Service and your Square Account may only be used in the fifty States of the United States of America and the District of Columbia.
You may not use the Service or your Square Account in any other jurisdiction.
You further agree not export the Service directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Service may be subject to export restrictions imposed by US law, including US Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR, Chapter VII).
By accepting this Agreement you confirm that you will satisfy these requirements.
2.
Managing Your Square Account
Your Square Accounts may be accessed through our software and website.
3.
==========
Square Account Balances
You may hold monetary balances that you receive in your Square Account (your "Balance").
You are not required to maintain a Balance to use our Service.
==========
When you carry a Balance, your funds will be co-mingled and held with other participants' funds in one or more pooled accounts at one or more FDIC-insured banks by us on your behalf and for the benefit of you and other users holding balances (each a "Pooled Account").
US dollar balances held in the Pooled Account are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance, meaning that your Balance may be FDIC insured up to $250,000 (or such other amount applicable to transaction accounts as determined by applicable law).
We have sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any Pooled Account.
==========
Funds associated with your Square Account will at all times be held separate from our corporate funds.
We will not use your funds for our corporate purposes (including without limitation the granting of any security or similar interest), will not voluntarily make funds available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose, and will not knowingly permit our creditors to attach the funds.
==========
You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that we handle for you.
As consideration for using the Service, you irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to our holding of your Balance in a Pooled Account or Reserve (described below).
4.
==========
Reserve
At any time and from time to time, we may temporarily suspend or delay payments to you and/or designate an amount of funds that we must maintain in your Square Account or in a separate reserve account established and maintained by us (a "Reserve") to secure the performance of your payment obligations under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, we may require a Reserve if you have a high rate of Chargebacks (described in Section 22), refunds, or other indications of performance problems related to your use of the services.
==========
The Reserve will be in an amount as reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks, returns, unshipped merchandise and/or unfulfilled services or credit risk based on your processing history or such amount designated by our Processor.
For the first six (6) months new Square Accounts will be required to maintain a Reserve of no less than the combination of a trailing 14 days of sales activity and any pending transaction disputes (i.e., Chargeback, refund request or claims).
The Reserve may be raised, reduced or removed at any time (including during the first six (6) months of a new Square Account) by Square, in its sole discretion, based on your payment history, a credit review, or otherwise as Square may determine or as may be required by our Processor.
==========
If you do not have sufficient funds in your Reserve, we may fund the Reserve from funds deposited by you upon our request or funds due to you under this Agreement.
