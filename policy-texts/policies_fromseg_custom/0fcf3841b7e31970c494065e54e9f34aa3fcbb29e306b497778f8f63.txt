Privacy Policy
                

                    Your Privacy and Security are a Top Priority at iHerb.
Since our inception back
                    in 1996, iHerb has never shared, rented, or sold any customer information to any
                    other party -- and never will.
==========
When you submit personal information on our website we will protect your information
                    both online and offline.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
                    information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it.
For
                    example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited
                    access, secured facilities.
==========
iHerb.com employees are trained and kept up-to-date
                    on our security procedures.
And as always, iHerb.com will never sell, rent, or share your personal information
                    with any other parties.
==========
And we will only disclose your information to the extent
                    we are required to do so by law or a court order.
iHerb takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect your personal information
                    from unauthorized disclosure or access.
==========
However, no data transmitted over the internet
                    or stored on a server can ever be 100% secured.
Therefore, while we strive to protect
                    your privacy and personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information
                    transmitted or disclosed to us online.
We are not responsible for the disclosure,
                    destruction or theft of your personal information.
If you opted to register with us, you established a password for your account, in
                    which case your online account information will be protected by your password.
==========
We
                    suggest that you do not share disclose your password to anyone.
You are responsible
                    for the confidentiality of your account and password and are fully responsible for
                    all activities that occur under your account and password.
We suggest creating challenging
                    passwords such as those with alphanumeric combinations.

Secure Ordering

                    When you submit personal information on our website, your information is protected
                    both online and offline.
We can only access your credit card (but not your actual
                    credit card information) to issue credits, never for actual charges.
Only you can
                    produce a charge by placing an order in your password-protected account.
==========
While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data
                    facility, the lock icon of your web browser becomes locked.
This indicates that
                    the connection between your web browser and our web server is secured.
While on
                    a secure page, the 'http' on your browser changes to 'https'.
==========
When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information
                    is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software which meets or exceeds
                    industry standards - (Secure Socket Layer).
While on a secure page, such as our
                    order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon on the bottom
                    of web browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes
                    locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
