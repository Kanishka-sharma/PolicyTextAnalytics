We're probably going to have to get the lawyers involved here eventually, but for
            now, we've tried to keep our policy simple, straightforward, and clear.
If you think
            we left anything out, or have any questions about any of this, 
                let us know.
Until our lawyers get ahold of it, here it is:

Privacy Policy

            Woot collects only the information that we need to process your order and to allow
            you to use the community forums.
Woot will not share, rent, lend, or sell this information
            to anyone, unless you specifically opt-in to some wild and crazy idea we come up
            with in the future.
==========
Woot will set and access our own cookies on your computer to
            allow you to buy and interact at the site.
Woot Newsletters

            With the launch of Woot 2.0, we are including all Woot account holders on our new
            Woot Newsletter list by default.
We will send only relevant Woot bulletins and you
            may opt out at any time on your My Account page.
Phishing and Identity Theft

            Woot will never send you an email asking you to send us personal, financial, or
            credit card information.
==========
If you receive such an email, DO NOT RESPOND.
It did not originate with Woot.
Sometimes, these emails may look like official Woot
            communications and may ask you to provide this information to confirm your account.
These so-called phishing expeditions are usually attempts to steal your identity
            and defraud you.
Please forward it to service@woot.com
            so we can take appropriate action.
