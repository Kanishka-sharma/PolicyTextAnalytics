Avocet is committed to protecting consumer privacy and to clearly informing users about the collection and use of information when using our services.
As a result, we have put together this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect and use certain information.
This Privacy Policy applies to Avocet's advertising products and services (our “Service”), as well as our company website located at http://avocet.io (our “Website”).
Avocet is the sole owner of the information collected on our Website.
==========
The information may consist of both Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”), and is collected in order to conduct business with current and prospective business clients.
We do not sell or rent data collected via our Websites to other parties, but we may provide it to third parties as necessary to conduct our business operations and to our customers for the performance of our Services, or we may disclose such data as otherwise described in this policy.
Avocet uses this data to provide requested information to prospective clients, to establish self-service advertiser and publisher accounts, and otherwise as necessary to conduct our business.
If you would like to review or request changes to PII that you have submitted through our Website, or would like to request that we not share your PII with third parties, please contact us using the information below.
==========
Avocet collects data from across our Platform.
This data, which may include anonymous identifiers such as cookies, does not identify you personally, and may come from such sources like your web browser, or the apps that you use.
We use a variety of technologies to collect this data, including “cookies,” which are small text files that can be stored on your browser.
We may also collect and/or use information collected by our partners and shared with us, and data from third party business partners.
We use this Non-PII along with our technology to perform a variety of tasks, such as improving the relevance of the ads, limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same device or browser (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of devices or browsers, or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked.
We may share this Non-PII with clients, vendors, and other companies with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise described in this policy.
We may also use some of this data to provide interest-based advertising, as discussed more fully below.
Avocet works with its clients to provide ads that are likely to be more interesting and more relevant to their users.
==========
One way we do this is by using our technology, along with Non-PII related to your browser or device that is gathered across different sources.
Examples of this data, which does not identify you personally (Non-PII), may include things like websites you have visited or apps that you use, information collected by our partners and other third parties and shared with us, or location information.
We may link an identifier to additional data from other partners to provide us with some information about users’ likely interests (for example, that a user seems to be interested in purchasing a new car).
When we have such information, the ads that we display to that user can be more relevant to his or her interests.

Websites.
Our Website may contain links to other websites, such as sites providing news coverage of the company, to partner sites for case studies, and to industry association sites of which Avocet is a member.
Avocet is not responsible for the privacy notices or practices of these third-party websites.
==========
Ads.
We may also provide ads that link to third-party sites, third-party apps, or other third-party content (“Third-Party Content”).
This Privacy Policy does not extend to Third-Party Content, or any services offered on Third-Party Content.
==========
We may, on behalf of our clients and partners, collect information from end users.
This may occur, for example, if someone submits information in response to an ad that we provide on behalf of an advertising client.
Such information may consist of PII, Non-PII, or both.
In such situations, we collect the information and provide it to our client, and it will be subject to that client’s privacy practices.
==========
If you believe your child has provided Avocet with personal information, such as by registering at one of Avocet’s websites, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us using the contact information below.
Avocet takes steps to protect the security of information that we collect.
To that end, we have designed and deployed hardware, software, and networking solutions in an effort to reasonably secure and protect access to our systems and data.
We may need to disclose information, including PII, when in our good-faith judgment we are required to do so by law, or when such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.
==========
We may also transfer all or some of the data discussed in this policy, in connection with a corporate merger, acquisition, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
Avocet is committed to continually examining and reviewing its privacy practices, and may make changes to its Privacy Policy.
In the event that any changes that we believe are material are made to the company´s privacy practices, we will post a revised Privacy Policy on this website.
If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, you may contact us at privacy@avocet.io
