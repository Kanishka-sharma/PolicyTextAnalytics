                      collection and use.

CONSUMER OPT-OUT CHOICES
Centro supports empowering you to make informed decisions about the
                      type of advertisements that are delivered to you online, and, as such, we are providing you the
                      opportunity to opt out of the tailored ads delivered to you by Centro based on your interests,
                      previous visits to other sites, and information stored in your web browser or mobile device.
If you select this option, you will still see just as many ads, but
                      they will no longer be personalized based on the information Centro has collected, (i.e. the ads
                      will likely be less relevant to you and your interests) and any information we have collected thus
                      far will be dissociated from your device, thereby preventing its use.
If our systems detect that
                      your computer or mobile device is located in the European Economic Area and you opt-out, we will
                      treat that opt-out as a request for the Basis DSP to cease processing your personal data.
Feel free to opt out here if you so desire:
Basis DSP

For desktop and mobile web, click
                          here.
The opt-out requires a cookie to be stored by your browser, in order to signal your
                        opt-out status to us during future ad calls.
By opting-out, you consent to Centro’s opt-out
                        cookie being stored by your browser.
==========
For mobile app:
                        
Find your phone’s Android Advertising Identifier (for Android
                            devices) or Apple Identifier for Advertising (for iOS devices).
On Android 6, open the Settings app and select “Google”.
Select “Ads”.
==========
Choose “Opt out
                                of Ads Personalization”, and make a note of your advertising ID.
In earlier versions of
                                Android, this is found in a separate Google Settings app instead.
On iOS, open the Settings App and select “Privacy”.
Select “Advertising”, and enable
                                “Limit Ad Tracking”.
On iOS 10 and above, this will set your Identifier for Advertising
                                to “0”, and no further action is needed, as this prevents its use.
On iOS 9 and below,
                                for additional confidence, you may wish to download an app such as My
                                  TUNE Device to determine your Identifier for Advertising and enter it in the box
                                below.

                      self-regulation, and as such, is a member in good standing with the Interactive Advertising
                      Bureau, (“IAB”) and is a participant in the Digital Advertising Alliance

                      Basis DSP collects pseudonymous information from these websites, mobile sites and mobile
                      applications and supplements that information with data from third parties.
Advertisers and media
                      buyers use Basis DSP to engage in a variety of advertising techniques, including interest-based
                      advertising, real-time (programmatic) advertising, contextual, and location-based advertising.
Basis DSP also provides buyers other tools, like the ability to measure how effective their ads
                      were, designed to make the buying of ad space seamless.
==========
What information does Basis DSP collect?
Basis DSP is designed to use certain types of data.
It includes data
                      generated through Basis DSP as well as data clients receive from other sources and then use on
                      Basis DSP, or that they buy through Basis DSP.
This may include pseudonymous information about
                      Internet users’ browsers and devices, such as:

information about the device’s operating system,
cookie information,
information about other identifiers assigned to the device,
the IP address from which the device accesses a client’s website or mobile application
information about whether an Internet user has visited a Centro client’s website, based on web
                        beacons placed on the site by our customer
information about the websites (i.e., the URLs) and mobile applications upon which we serve
                        advertisements
information about the geographic location of the device when it accesses a website or mobile
                        application
inferences or information about users’ interests that are created, acquired, bought, sold, or
                        used by our clients

How does Basis DSP use the information that it collects?
We use the information we collect to serve targeted ads to individuals.
More specifically, the platform enables our users to use this
                      information to:

Determine what ad to show an individual, and to serve that ad (including behaviorally targeted
                        ads) to that individual
Customize ads to particular types of audiences;
Customize ads to the type of web page an individual is viewing;
Perform analysis of how effective the ads served are;
Learn more about their own customers;
Limit the number of times an individual sees an ad;
Detect fraud; and
Troubleshoot platform or campaign issues.
==========
In order to use this information as described above, we may need to
                      transfer that information to third party partners, and such transfer may be considered a sale of
                      data in California.
How long is the information stored and kept?
For data collected via browsers and stored in cookies, Basis DSP
                      stores this data for up to 60 days.

                      application advertising and stored via mobile advertising IDs Basis DSP stores this data for up to
                      180 days.
Our systems typically reset the retention period each time we encounter the same user.
==========
How does Basis DSP collect this information?
Basis DSP uses cookies, beacons, mobile SDKs, tags and other technology to collect data
                      associated with particular devices or web browsers.
Customers then use this data within Basis DSP
                      to enhance and refine digital ad campaigns.
Does Basis DSP use web beacons (aka clear GIFs or web bugs)?
Yes.
==========
“Web beacons” are small images (generally a single transparent
                      pixel) with a unique identifier, served to you as part of a web page or other document.
Web
                      beacons may be used in parts of our services for purposes such as site traffic reporting, unique
                      visitor counts, advertising auditing and reporting, and personalization.
For more information on
                      web beacons, see http://www.allaboutcookies.org/faqs/beacons.html

We use any information provided by Basis DSP and Basis Platform
                      advertising customers for the following service-related purposes:

To provide, operate, manage, maintain and enhance the platform.
We internally perform
                        statistical and other analysis on information we collect (including usage data, device data,
                        referral data, and information from page tags) to analyze and measure user behavior and trends,
                        to understand how people use our services, and to monitor, troubleshoot and improve our
                        services.

                        transactional nature (e.g. service-related announcements, billing-related matters, changes to
                        our services or policies, welcome emails when you first register, etc.).
You can’t opt out of
                        these communications, since they are necessary in order for us to effectively provide our
                        services to you.
To contact you for marketing purposes.
We will only do this if you have given us your express
                        permission to contact you for this purpose.
To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.
If we receive a subpoena or other legal
                        request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.

To create new services, features or content.
We may use any information you provide us (e.g.
                        via email or through our ticketing system) to create and provide new services, features or
                        content.
Will Centro share the information collected via the Basis DSP or Basis Platform?
We share aggregate information collected from the Basis DSP for marketing purposes.
==========
For
                        example, we may issue a press release announcing that users who have visited travel sites have a
                        higher click-thru rate on finance related web pages.
Billing and Contact information – We work with trusted agents and service providers to assist
                        us in billing and account maintenance for our clients.
These companies are required by contract
                        to only use the information as directed by Centro and are prohibited from selling it.
For
                        example, if you fund your platform account with a credit card, we use a credit card processing
                        company to bill you for the services and share your address and billing details with them in
                        order to do so.
These service providers do not retain, share, store or use that information for
                        any other purpose.
To interact with ad delivery partners - As noted above, in certain instances, we may share
                        information and “cookie sync” with our suppliers, which include data companies and ad exchanges.
==========
To provide the services – Centro may provide customer platform data to partners and service
                        providers for the purpose of operating, managing, maintaining, or enhancing Centro’s services,
                        including for the safety and security of the platform and the online industry, or as required by
                        law.
Centro does not share the information collected on the platform with other third parties,
                        unless legally required.
As a Basis DSP user or Basis Platform customer, what communications can I expect from
                      Centro?
Special Offers and Updates – We will occasionally send you information on products, services,
                        special deals, and promotions (if you opt-in on our registration page).
If you no longer wish to
                        receive this type of communication, you can opt-out through the link in the email communication.
==========
Surveys or Contests – From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in
                        contests or surveys on our site.
If you participate, we may request certain personally
                        identifiable information from you.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
                        voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
We use
                        this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, and to process and analyze survey
                        results.
We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that
                        company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other
                        purpose.
==========
Service-related Announcements – We will send you strictly service-related announcements on
                        rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.
For instance, if our service is undergoing
                        temporary maintenance, we might send you an email.
Generally, you may not opt-out of these
                        communications, which are not promotional in nature.
If you do not wish to receive them, you
                        have the option to deactivate your account.
==========
Customer Service – Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will
                        send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.
We will also communicate with
                        you in response to your inquiries, to
                        provide the services you request, and to manage your account.
We will communicate with you
                        through our ticketing system, via email, and by phone.
If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you
                      may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.
Through our partners, we use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to
                      let us know which emails recipients have opened.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of
                      certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
==========
Supplementation of Information: In order to provide certain
                      services to you, we may supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from
                      third party sources, for example, in connection with credit decisions and verification of any
                      information provided.
CENTRO'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS
What information does Centro collect pursuant to running its business, and how is it
                      used?
In addition to running our website, which is discussed below, we
                      collect certain information as part of running our business.
We maintain contact records of
                      business partners, service providers and customers.
==========
We provide some of them to login to our
                      systems to view reports and as such will process their email addresses and passwords to enable the
                      login.
We also obtain billing and payment information from them so we can collect payment for our
                      services.

                      information.
CENTRO.NET WEBSITE VISITORS
What information does the Centro website collect, and how is it used?
We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our website.
This may include which of our pages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those
                      actions, and so on.
==========
Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that
                      record data each time a device accesses those servers.
The log files contain data about the nature
                      of each access, including originating IP addresses.
We collect data from the device and
                      application you use to access our services, such as your IP address and browser type.
We may also
                      infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
If you arrive at our website from an
                      external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about
                      the source that referred you to us.
We use third party tracking services that employ cookies and
                      page tags (also known as web beacons) to
                      collect pseudonymous data about visitors to our websites and their collection of data may
                      constitute a sale under California law.
This data includes usage and user statistics, but not
                      personally identifiable information.
==========
Does Centro.net use cookies?
Yes.
“Cookies” are pieces of information (actually, alphanumeric
                      identifiers) generated by web servers, and stored on your web browser for future access.
Cookies
                      cannot view or retrieve data from other cookies, nor can they capture files or data stored on your

We do not link the information that we store in cookies to any information that may be
                      used to ascertain your real world identity.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
==========
We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
A session ID cookie expires
                      when you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period
                      of time.
==========
You can remove persistent
                      cookies by following directions provided in your web browser’s “help” file.
We set a
                      persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.
Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
                      experience on our site.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use

Please
                      be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
Therefore, while we strive to use
                      commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
                      absolute security.

Centro may transfer data processed by our Platform to our advertisers,
                      their ad agencies or their data management platforms and such transfers may constitute a sale of

                      properly, i) auditing, debugging and security vendors.
==========
These agents work on our behalf and use
                      data only as directed by us, provided that such third party agents provide at least the same level
                      of privacy protection as we do.
The above notwithstanding, we may disclose any of the information we
                      collect when we believe that we have a legal obligation to do so or to protect the safety,
                      property or rights of Centro or of any third party.
For example, we may disclose any of the above
                      in order to (i) protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
                      process served, (ii) for law enforcement or national security purposes including sharing data of
                      EU and Swiss individuals in response to lawful requests from public authorities to meet national
                      security and law enforcement requirements, or (iii) protect or defend our proprietary rights.
==========
Centro is responsible for the processing of personal information it
                      receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third-party acting as an agent
                      on its behalf.
Centro shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield principles if its agent process
                      such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield principles, unless the
                      organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
We will also provide an EU or Swiss individual with opt-out or opt-in
                      choice before we share their personal data with third parties other than our agents, or before we
                      use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
If
                      you’re located in the EU or Switzerland and seek to limit the use and disclosure of your
                      information, please submit a written request to privacy@centro.net.
In the event that Centro (or its parent or subsidiary companies) goes
                      through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or
                      a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets
                      transferred.
==========
You will be notified via prominent notice on our site for 30 days of any such change
                      in ownership or control of your personal information.
Does the Centro privacy policy apply to other sites?
This site contains links to other sites that are not owned or
                      controlled by Centro.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
==========
We
                      encourage you to be aware when you leave our site, and to read the privacy statements of each and
                      every site that collects personally identifiable information.
This privacy statement applies only
                      to information collected by Centro.
What if Centro changes this privacy policy?
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so
                      please review it frequently.
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the updated
                      version, together with an updated Effective Date, on this page.

                      page periodically for any changes.
CALIFORNIA DATA SUBJECTS
Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
                      provides additional privacy protections for California data subjects and users, including: a) the
                      right to see what personal information we have about you, your computer or device (the right to
                      know), b) the right to delete the personal information we have about you, your computer or device
                      (the right to delete) and c) the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information about you,

==========
We do not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights.
Moreover, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would violate applicable law.
If you are a Customer or partner of Centro and have questions about
                      your ability to see the data
                      used to login to our systems, we ask that you direct your question to the person that owns the
                      business relationship.
If you would like to exercise your Right to Know or Right to Delete,
                      you may do so by sending us
                      an email at privacy@centro.net or by calling
                      844-784-5263.
As a California data subject, if you
                      make a subject access request as set out in this policy, you are entitled to see and delete the
                      personal information that we have about you.
==========
We will confirm your request within 10 days and make
                      a good faith attempt to fulfill your request within 45 days.
We may take reasonable steps to verify your request.
We will fulfill
                      requests we are able to
                      verify so long as we are not prohibited from doing so by applicable law and/or the information is
                      not essential for us for billing, fraud prevention or security purposes.
We will share our
                      reason(s) for denying your request in the event that we are unable to fulfill your request.
==========
You may make an access or deletion request via an authorized agent by having such agent follow the
                      process below.
Please note that we will request any authorized agent demonstrate that they have
                      been authorized by you to make a request on your behalf.
And we will attempt to verify your
                      request.
We require any authorized agents to provide us with contact details such as an email
                      address and phone number so that we may ensure a timely response.
==========
The CCPA defines personal information broadly and as such, it includes
                      pseudonymous identifiers
                      such as cookie IDs and mobile advertising IDs.
Under the CCPA, your request to see the personal
                      information that we have about you may include: (1) specific pieces of personal information that
                      we may have about you; (2) categories of personal information we have collected about you; (3)
                      categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; (4) categories of personal
                      information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose about you; (5) categories of third
                      parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose under the
                      CCPA; and (6) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information (California Residents)

                      If you are a California resident, you are also entitled to opt-out of sales of your personal
                      information by Centro to third parties.
To exercise those rights, please click here to access “Consumer Opt-Out Choices” and follow the instructions
                      provided there.
==========
EUROPEAN UNION DATA SUBJECTS
The General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”) affords additional rights
                      to EU data subjects.
Those rights include the right to complain to EU Supervisory Authorities and
                      the right to access, correct, port to another party and delete certain personal data processed by
                      Centro.
With respect to EU data subjects, personal data includes pseudonymous
                      information such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID.
Where Centro is a
                      controller of data (e.g., via our Basis DSP), the legal basis will be both legitimate interest and
                      consent depending on the type of information subject to processing and the information we receive
                      from upstream partners.
Where we rely upon legitimate interest, we have assessed the processing is
                      not high risk and will not violate fundamental human rights of EU data subjects.
Where Centro receives from an EU data subject a request to cease
                      processing of data via one of the choice mechanisms listed above, Centro will stop all data
                      processing with respect to the opted out browser or device unless such processing is required by
                      law.
If you’re an EU data subject and believe Centro is processing your
                      pseudonymous information (e.g., Centro cookie ID or mobile advertising ID) or your contact
                      information (e.g., email address, telephone number) and you wish to exercise your right to access,
                      delete, port or remove such information, please send an email to privacy@centro.net and we will respond to your request
                      within 30 days.
