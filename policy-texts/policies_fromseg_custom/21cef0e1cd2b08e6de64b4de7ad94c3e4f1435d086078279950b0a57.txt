TRUSTe Verifications are conducted in three phases:
Assessment Phase
The Assessment phase helps identify and mitigate privacy risks and also provide access to a range of other services.
Privacy Review
The first step is to define the assessment scope by business units, product/service lines, and digital properties (websites, apps, cloud platforms).
A member of our Global Privacy Solutions team works with your team to efficiently guide discovery of necessary information, including relevant data flows and evaluation of your privacy policies and practices against relevant standards.
==========
Findings Report
A findings report is delivered which includes a gap analysis, risk summary and remediation recommendations.
The report outlines actionable steps required to achieve compliance.
Remediation and Verification Phase
The Verification phase ensures all required remediation changes have been completed prior to filing your application with the Department of Commerce.
Remediation Assistance
Rely on us to help you remediate gaps in your privacy programs, and validate that your privacy statements reflect your privacy practices and are consistent with applicable standards.
==========
Third-Party Assistance
We provide authorization to list TRUSTe as third-party verification for your Department of Commerce filing and registration record.
TRUSTe Verified Privacy Seal
After completing the required changes, we authorize your use of the TRUSTe Verified Privacy seal for display on applicable digital properties.
The seal is hosted and linked to a TRUSTe Validation Page to provide real-time verification along with an easy-to-understand consumer notice verifying your company meets globally recognized privacy requirements.

As proof of TRUSTe Certification, an official Letter of Attestation can be shared with your business partners, providing your organization with competitive differentiation.
