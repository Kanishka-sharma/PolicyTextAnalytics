General Information
VMware respects the privacy of our customers, business partners and other visitors to our websites.
We recognize the need for appropriate protections and management of your personal information that you provide to us.
VMware has therefore established this Privacy Statement to assist you to understand what information we collect and how that information is used.
This Privacy Statement applies to data collected by VMware Inc. and VMware Global (“VMware”) through the vmware.com website and other webpages which we operate and in which we post a direct link to this statement.
==========
EU-US Safe Harbor
VMware adheres to the EU-US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as described in more detail in our General Safe Harbor Privacy Notice.
What personal information does VMware collect?
On VMware web sites you can order products or services, register products, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register to a secure extranet site to obtain access to product information, support, services and training, or apply for jobs at VMware.
Personal Information for the purpose of this Privacy Statement is information that identifies or can be used to identify a specific individual.
==========
VMware may collect information about individuals such as their name, address, telephone number or email address, user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card or other financial information and contact preferences.
Personal information collected online may be supplemented with information you provide to VMware through other VMware services, as well as other sources such as trade shows or seminars, and other data appending methods such as spot tags, tracking and cookies as referenced below.
How does VMware use personal information?
VMware will use personal information to provide customers and business partners with information and services and to help us better understand your needs and interests.
Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to deliver products/services to you, to bill you for products/services you purchased, and to provide ongoing service and support.
Occasionally we may use your information to contact you to complete surveys that we use for marketing and quality assurance purposes.
==========
With whom does VMware share personal information?
VMware contracts with third party service providers and suppliers (including distributors and resellers) to deliver certain products, services and customer solutions.
VMware may share personal information with its service providers and suppliers to the extent needed to deliver the service or respond to requests for information on products or services or otherwise support the customers' business needs.
Third party service providers and suppliers receiving personal information are expected to apply the same level of privacy protection as contained in this Privacy Statement.
==========
They are required to keep confidential the personal information received from VMware and may not use it for any purpose other than as originally intended.
Some VMware services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company.
If you register for or use such services, both VMware and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
==========
Except as described in this Privacy Statement, VMware is not in the business of selling or renting your information to others and will not share personally identifiable information with other third parties without your permission, unless required by, or in connection with, law enforcement action, subpoena or other litigation, or applicable law or in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business.
We reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information collected via the site that is not in personally identifiable form.
Choice & Consent
VMware does not require that customers, business partners or non-employee visitors to VMware websites provide VMware with personal information.
==========
The decision to provide personal information is voluntary.
If you do not provide the personal information requested, however, you may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the benefit for which the personal information is being requested.
You can always unsubscribe or choose not to receive promotional information from us by following the specific instructions in the email you receive or by notifying us via the appropriate method below depending on which site is at issue.
It may take a reasonable period of time to process your request, no longer than 30 days.
==========
In countries where required by law, VMware will offer you the opportunity to opt in before promotional materials are sent to you.
This will not apply to the receipt of mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain VMware services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service.
Access to and accuracy of your information
VMware strives to keep your personal information accurate.
We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain data accuracy.
==========
We will provide you with access to your information, including making reasonable effort to provide you with online access and the opportunity to change your information.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.
VMware will not process personal information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual, as required by applicable law.
Security of Personal Information
VMware is committed to taking reasonable efforts to secure the personal data you choose to provide us.
To protect the privacy of any personal information you may have provided, VMware employs industry-standard controls including physical access controls, encryption, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, and network monitoring.
In addition, all personal data as defined in this Statement is limited to those individuals and agents having a need to know.
==========
Forums and Blogs
Some of VMware's websites allow our users to publish content via discussion forums, blogs, user-editable documents, and commenting systems.
Any information that is disclosed in these forums becomes public information which could be read, collected or used by other users to send you unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
VMware may, from time to time, send email regarding our products and services to users who have posted to our discussion forums, blogs, user-editable documents, and commenting systems.
Each participant's opinion expressed is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of VMware.
Note also that your use of these online communication tools is subject to our Terms of Use, which contain disclaimers, limitations of liability and a choice of California law.
Personal information given to VMware may be transferred across state and country borders for data consolidation, storage and simplified information management.
==========
Spotlight Tags, Logging and Cookies
VMware uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.
These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick.
These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.
The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick.
With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

==========
As is true of most websites, VMware collects and/or logs Internet Protocol addresses, Internet domain names, the web browser and operating system used to access the VMware web site, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit.
VMware collects these through the use of log files and web beacons.
VMware also uses cookies on some of its web sites.
Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a web site via your browser to be placed on your computer.
Thereafter when you visit a web site, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the web site.
You may elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your web browser.
However, not utilizing cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and features of web sites.

==========
Links to Non-VMware Websites and Third Parties
The VMware web sites may provide links to third-party web sites for your convenience and information.
If you access those links, you will leave the VMware website.
VMware does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from VMware policy.
We do not endorse or make any representations about third party web sites.
==========
The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by the VMware Privacy Statement.
We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.
Some third party companies may choose to share their personal data with VMware; that sharing is governed by that third party company's privacy policy.
Verification
VMware will engage in periodic self-assessment to verify that it continues to be in compliance with this Privacy Statement.
