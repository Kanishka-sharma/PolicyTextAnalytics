Read about our repeat infringers policy here.
==========
If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or other content infringes upon your rights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") with this form with the following information in electronic form (see 17 U.S.C. 512 (3) for further detail):
an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
a description identifying the material claimed to have been infringed and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and the location where the original or an authorized copy of the material exists (for example, the URL of the page of the website where it is lawfully posted; the name, edition and pages of a book from which an excerpt was copied, etc.);
information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an electronic mail;
a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material, in the manner complained of, is not authorized by its rightful owner, its agent, or the law; and
a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rightful copyright owner or that your are authorized to act on behalf of the owner’s behalf.
The Counter-Notification Process
When a user’s video submission has been removed pursuant to a DMCA take-down notice that complies with 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), the Website shall notify the user of this removal.
Pursuant to the Website’s repeat infringer policy, the user then has seventy-two (72) hours to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original take-down notice was sent in error.
The Counter-Notification may be sent to the email the user originally received a notice from (c******@xvideos.com).
For the Website to consider a user’s counter-notification, it must comply with the requirements of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(3) and include the following:
1.
A physical or electronic signature of the user.
2.
Identification the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available.
3.
A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
4.
The user’s name, address, and telephone number.
5.
A statement that the user consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Website may be found.
6.
==========
A statement that the user will accept service of process from the person who sent the notice of alleged infringement or an agent of such person.
Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and will not be considered by the Website.
Failure to provide effective counter-notification when a takedown notice is issued for a video posted by a user’s account will result in a strike against the user’s account; three strikes, as described on this page, will lead to the termination of a user’s account under the Website’s repeat infringer policy.
==========
CONTENT OWNERS (CHANNEL) AND TAKE-DOWN REQUESTS
In order to protect content owners from abusive take-down requests, or requests sent in error, we do not automatically disable videos that are owned by a content owner (channel).
If such a notice was sent through the online form for copyright infringements, the sender will automatically receive an email warning him that such links pertaining to a channel were found, and will be requested to email us with more information.
If you sent us a notice through direct email or letter we will try to inform you of the situation however we cannot guarantee that we will do it everytime because some notices include many links.
Channels on xvideos are made for exclusive content owners only.
==========
We do not give this status to companies or individuals that simply bought non-exclusive video licenses.
However it is sometimes difficult to evaluate content so if you think some channels on xvideos do not own the content they are uploading please contact us and we will remove their content owner status if we find that we made a mistake.
