COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES POLICY
Updated on 22 May 2018
BBC Studios Group (“BBCS”), our service providers and advertising partners use cookies and tracking technologies on our websites and mobile app (“Apps”).
We do this to enable us to analyse use of our online services, to improve and personalise your experience of our services and to serve advertising which, on some services, may be tailored to you based on your browsing behaviour and other data held about you.
The information in this policy relate to the use of cookies and tracking technologies by the companies in the BBC Studios group, (herein referred to as “BBCS”, “we”, “our” or “us”).
As stated in our Privacy Policy, BBCS is the data controller of any personal data processed within the BBC Studios Group, including in relation to this website.
BBCS respects your right to privacy and we aim to be transparent at all times about when, how and why we may use data about you and your browsing behaviours in connection with our services.
We are committed to using cookies and tracking technologies fairly and in accordance with your privacy rights.
This policy describes:
What cookies and online tracking technologies are;
How we use cookies;
Analytics on our services;
Advertising on our services;
Your choices (managing cookies and opting out); 
How to contact us.
To find out more about BBCS and our approach to privacy please read our Privacy Policy.
WHAT ARE COOKIES AND ONLINE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
Web Browser Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is sent by a website to your computer or mobile device where it is stored by your web browser.
A cookie contains limited non-personal data, usually a unique identifier and the name of the site.
This enables a website to recognise you as you move around the site and/or each time you revisit.
==========
We use cookies to:
remember information about you, so you don’t have to give it to us again
keep you signed in, even on different devices;
help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better;
help us personalise your experience by remembering your preferences and settings;
deliver advertising where you provided your consent; and
to find out if our emails have been read and if you find them useful.
You can change your BBCS cookie settings at any time, and you can find out how to stop your browser tracking your info here.
Different types of cookies
Cookies may be served to you by the website you are visiting (a “first party cookie”) or by another organisation providing services to that website, such as an analytics company or advertising network (a “third party cookie”).
They will either be stored for the duration of your visit (a “session cookie”) or they will remain on your device for a fixed period, which could be months or even years, to remember you across multiple browsing sessions (a “persistent cookie”).
==========
Other types of local storage, such as Flash Cookies and HTML5 Storage
Many websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video and game content to their users.
Adobe utilise their own cookies which are used by the Flash Player to store data such as your preferences, and your viewing and browsing history.
HTML5 Storage is similar in concept to browser cookies in that the data is stored in your browser’s files, and it is used for similar purposes; however as this storage enables website publishers to store greater amounts of data, they will often use it to store usage data and preferences (alongside the unique ID usually stored in a cookie) instead of on their own systems.
==========
Tracking technologies: web beacons/GIFs, page tags, script
Web pages, emails and Apps may contain a small transparent image file or line of code to record how you interact with them.
They are often used in conjunction with web browser cookies (or the unique identifier of your mobile device) and they are used to help website and app publishers to better analyse and improve their services and to target advertising based on your browsing behaviour and interests.
For example, by knowing which web pages you visit or which elements of a page you viewed, when and for how long, whether you viewed and/or clicked on an advert on the site or whether you opened or clicked on marketing emails sent to you.
Tracking via Apps
When you use our Apps, we may record unique identifiers associated with your device (such as the device ID, IP address, MAC address or IMEI number), your activity within the App and your network location.
==========
This information may be used to analyse and improve our services and, for Apps supported by advertising, to serve advertising to you.
HOW WE USE COOKIES ON OUR ONLINE SERVICES
We use cookies and tracking technologies for a variety of reasons, such as to enable us to recognise when you have logged in, to improve your experience of the services and to deliver advertising.
In particular, we use these technologies for:
‘Strictly Necessary’ Purposes: to let you use all the difference parts of the BBCS website or Apps, when you sign in or to keep you logged in, remembering things you’ve already done, to facilitate a purchase, to improve the security of our services and for system administration, such as preventing fraudulent or disruptive activity; 
Functionality Purposes: to remember your preferences and settings and other functionality you have requested, such as remembering your username and password so that you do not need to login each time you visit;
Analytics and Performance-Related Purposes: to help BBCS to understand how people use our website and Apps, so we can make them better, to record what you like and don’t like on the website and the popularity of various elements of the website so that we can ensure that it works properly at points of high usage.
We also use analytics companies to gather information regarding users of our services on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code, which is embedded on our website.
==========
Advertising Purposes: some of our websites contain advertising, all of which is clearly marked with the word “Advertisement”.
Cookies and tracking technologies may sometimes be used to deliver advertising and marketing messages relevant to you - a common practice across the internet and known as online behavioural advertising.
More information about analytics and advertising is detailed below.
Analytics on our services
On our websites we use Google Analytics, and other similar services, to collect statistical information about how our websites are used.
They use information such as your IP address, browser type and unique identifiers stored in (first party) cookies on your device to record how you interact with our website.
On some services, we also use Google Demographics and Interests data gathered via the Google DoubleClick cookie.
We only use this data in aggregate form and we do not merge it with any other data we hold, however it is important to note that these reports are derived from Google’s (third party) DoubleClick cookie and device identifiers, which are also used for advertising.
These analytical services help us to know how many users we have, which parts of our sites are most popular, what browsers are used (so we can maximise compatibility), the country or region where our users are located, and the demographics and interests of our users.
This enables us to understand better who is using our site and to ensure we are reaching our target demographic, and to improve and tailor our services accordingly.
