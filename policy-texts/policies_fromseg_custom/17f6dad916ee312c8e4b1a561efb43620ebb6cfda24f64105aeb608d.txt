Cookie disclaimer: “Cookies” are small bits of text that are either used for the duration of a session (“session cookies”) or saved on a user’s hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time the user logs on the a Web site (“persistent cookies”).
NIST does not use persistent cookies or any other persistent tracking technology.
However, for some videos that are visible on www.nist.gov, a "persistent cookie" is set by third party providers when you click to play a video.
These videos are identified with a link to a cookie disclaimer under the video and are used by the third party provider to collect statistics on the number of unique Web visitors viewing specific videos.
A waiver has been issued by the White House Counsel's office to allow for the use of these types of persistent cookies by third parties on the White House Web site and NIST is following the White House example by providing an alternative method for viewing these videos.
If you would like to view a video without the use of persistent cookies, click on the link that reads "download mp4."
