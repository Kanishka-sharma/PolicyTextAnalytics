Security & Privacy Policy
Harrods respects your privacy and your desire to understand how your information will be handled and used.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and store your information.
Using your information in a way that you are comfortable with and keeping your information secure is an integral part of the luxury retail experience we aim to provide.
Harrods will ensure that all information-protection and customer-legislation standards are met when handling any of your personal information.
==========
References in this Privacy Policy to ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘Harrods’ are to Harrods Limited (company number 30209), registered office 87–135 Brompton Road, Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7XL.
Harrods Limited is a registered information controller with registration number Z603738X.
We collect and use information about you to provide you with a luxury retail experience.
You provide us with your information directly when you make a purchase, sign up to become a Harrods Rewards member, shop online, use the Harrods app, or register for a competition.
We also collect elements of your information indirectly such as the route you have taken around the Harrods store.
==========
If you instruct Royal Mail to redirect your post, we will receive your updated address information and update our records.
Similarly, if we are informed that you are no longer at the address we have on file for you, we will remove it from our records.
We may analyse the information that you supply to us and share your personal data with third parties who help us segment and understand our customers by providing additional information.
We use this to provide you with a more personalised experience.
Should you choose to take advantage of one of our Personal Shopping services, including clientelling, you will have an appointed Personal Shopper or sales associate assigned to you.
Your shopper will collect information relevant to you in order to curate the most exclusive and luxurious personalised retail experience.
Your Personal Shopper will always keep you updated on the information that they hold and how it affects you, and will follow your instructions as to how you would like to be contacted by them.
==========
When you make a purchase at any of our retail outlets or online, we will collect necessary information about you to ensure we can fulfil your order or chosen service.
If you choose to pay by card, we will need to collect your payment information in order to process payment.
We may ask for additional information from you for a number of reasons: for example, to prevent fraudulent transactions; to comply with anti-money laundering obligations for high-value transactions; or to ensure that we comply with our legal obligations such as age restrictions applicable to the sale of guns, knives or alcohol, or the legal requirement to share your details with TV Licensing when you purchase a television.
When you place an order with Harrods for products or services that will be delivered, collected or provided at a later date, we will need to take additional contact details and delivery information from you so that we may complete your order.
We may use third-party couriers to deliver your order and will need to share your contact information with them for this purpose.
==========
At any point that you interact with us, you may be given the opportunity to opt in to receive Harrods marketing communications.
We will only send you marketing communications when you have consented to receive them, and we will do so using your preferred channels of communication.
If you have not updated your marketing preferences in two years, we will contact you to remind you that you can opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time:
- In cases where you have not made a purchase with Harrods during this two-year period, we will only continue to send you marketing communications if you expressly tell us to do so.
If you do nothing, then we will stop sending you marketing communications.
- If you have made a purchase with Harrods during this period, we will continue to communicate with you in the same way until you tell us otherwise.
If you do nothing, we will assume that you are happy to continue receiving marketing materials from Harrods in the same way.
==========
If you have opted in to receive marketing communications from us, you can manage your preferences online at any time.
We have created a Preference Centre where you can manage your marketing communications preferences, and tell us what you want to hear about and how you want Harrods to communicate with you.
We will send you marketing material that we believe you will be interested in based on your previous spending behaviour.
==========
You may not receive all types of communications that you have chosen to receive.
To understand more about the criteria we use to determine which marketing communications you receive, please contact our Customer Service team.
If you have given us your email address or mobile phone number and agreed to receive marketing communications from us, we may supply this data to digital advertising or social media companies, including Facebook and Google.
These companies work on our behalf to identify individuals with similar characteristics to our customers, and they provide these individuals with advertising content from us.
We may also work with these companies to target or retarget you directly with advertisements that we believe you will be interested in.
==========
The data we provide to these organisations is limited to email address or mobile phone number and is always provided in an encrypted format.
We use your personal data in this manner as it is in our legitimate interest to advertise to potential new customers.
This use of your personal data constitutes profiling.
==========
If you would prefer not to see targeted advertising from us on social media, please refer to the instructions provided by Facebook or Google, or contact our Customer Service team for advice on how to opt out.
Please note: when you visit one of Harrods’ brand partners in-store or participate in a branded promotion or event, our brand partners may also ask if you want to sign up to receive marketing communications directly from them about their events, products and services.
If you provide your personal details to any of our brand partners, the use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy and cannot be managed through Harrods or the Preference Centre.
Please ask the relevant sales associate for details about their privacy policy and how you can manage your marketing communications preferences with them.
==========
The most exclusive news about events, products and services is reserved for Harrods Rewards members.
Should you become a Rewards member and opt in to hear about Rewards (which includes news and exclusive offers dependent on your Harrods Rewards tier), we will contact you about the many benefits reserved for Rewards members.
Some of these benefits include a Cash Reward, a birthday treat, complimentary copies of Harrods Magazine, complimentary tea and coffee, free delivery or special discount days.
==========
Your information will also be used in-store to check your eligibility for each of our benefits, and to track your usage so that we can monitor customer engagement to improve our service.
From time to time, we may also collect publicly available information about you which is not essential to the Rewards programme, but which enables us to learn more about you.
In turn, we can provide a more tailored service.
If you would like to stop Harrods using this information about you in this way, please contact us at [email protected].
As part of the Harrods Rewards programme, Harrods operates the Mini Harrods programme, which offers customers additional exclusive benefits, promotions and events tailored towards children up to the age of 10.
==========
Harrods only collects information about children where the parent or guardian has given their consent.
Harrods does not knowingly collect information from customers under the age of 13 directly.
In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will delete it immediately.
From time to time as a Rewards member, you will be emailed by us with a request for anonymous feedback about your experience visiting us.
Feedback is used to improve the experience we provide and is anonymous.
If you apply for, or already have, a Harrods American Express card as part of your Harrods Rewards membership benefits, we are required to share certain information collected by Harrods in connection with your Harrods card with American Express UK Limited.

==========
In order to deliver the best possible customer experience, Harrods offers a variety of Personal Shopping services that may involve you sharing additional personal information about yourself with Harrods.
This is so that we can tailor your shopping experience with recommendations of products and services that may be relevant to your lifestyle and preferences.
We understand that as part of this, you may share with us sensitive information about your personal circumstances, or festivals and holidays that are important to you.
Harrods will always ensure that we have your consent to use this sensitive information as part of the Personal Shopping service.
The level and content of the information that you provide to Harrods and the communications that you receive as part of the Personal Shopping service are always set and agreed to by you.
You can discuss these arrangements and change them at any time by speaking to the Personal Shopping team directly.
Please note: your Personal Shopping arrangements are not part of Harrods’ general marketing communications and cannot be managed through the Preference Centre.
==========
To ensure that you are still happy with the service provided by Harrods, if we have not discussed your existing arrangements with you for two years we will contact you to check that you are still happy with these arrangements.
If we are unable to contact you for any reason, your existing personal details will be retained but your account will be set as ‘dormant’ until we can confirm that you are happy to continue using the service (please note: we will delete any sensitive information about you while the account is dormant).
If we are unable to reach you for a further two years, then we will delete all information held by the Personal Shopping team and formally close your Personal Shopping account.
If you prefer not to use Harrods’ official Personal Shopping services, our sales associates will be more than happy for you to share your personal details with them on an informal basis for a specific purpose, such as asking to be contacted when a certain product is back in stock.
We will only use this information for the specific purpose that you have agreed to, after which your information will be deleted.
You may also provide your personal details to our brand partners operating in our retail outlets, in which case the use of your information will be subject to the brand’s privacy policy.
If you are unsure, please ask the sales associate to confirm whether your information is being collected by Harrods or by the individual brand, and if it is the latter ask for details about their privacy policy.
==========
When you visit harrods.com, we collect information about your device to help drive innovation and improve user experience.
Information can be collected through your IP address or through cookies placed on your device.
Some cookies are needed for the proper functioning of the website.
==========
Cookies are used for purposes including the storage of items in your shopping bag; the recognition (anonymous) that you are signed in; and the determination of your currency, dependent on preferred delivery location.
Other cookies are used for analytic purposes which help us understand how and when you first visited our site, the frequency of your visits and the duration of time spent on our site.
We also use cookies to track your journey around the site and ensure that our email marketing invite pop-up is displayed at the most appropriate time.
This technology allows us to remember you, so if you have previously visited the site, we are able to recognise you as a returning visitor.
If you have already signed up to receive marketing emails, you will not see the pop-up unless you disable the relevant cookie.
==========
We try to join up details of our relationship with you in-store and online in our records, even if you use different devices online.
Finally, some cookies are used to provide you with personalised advertisements when you visit other selected websites, following your visit to harrods.com.
These advertisements will be in the form of ‘banner advertising’ and will show you products that we believe you will be interested in, based on your browsing history on our website.
For more information about how Harrods uses cookies, please refer to our Cookie Policy.
When you make a purchase on harrods.com, we will collect information about you to fulfil your order or chosen service; this information includes your name, contact details and delivery address.
==========
You will be offered the opportunity to use our Guest Checkout path or to create an online account on our website.
In order to register an online account, we will ask you for your name and contact details.
You will also be asked to create a password and have the option of linking your Harrods Rewards membership.
Once you have created an account, this will serve as a platform to update your marketing preferences through the Preference Centre.
==========
All visitors to our Knightsbridge store are invited to take advantage of the free Wifi, which is provided through Purple.
The Wifi can be accessed by signing up with your email address.
(To view the Harrods Wifi Terms & Conditions please see here.)
Your email address will be shared with both Purple and Harrods.
==========
If you have downloaded the Harrods app you will have access to our Store Guide, which uses Bluetooth technology to help you find your location and plan your route around our store.
If you have Wifi capabilities switched on and/or Bluetooth enabled with the Harrods app open, we will collect location information from your device about the route you took around the store.
Harrods uses this information to understand the more popular routes and destinations chosen by our customers so that we can improve our navigation strategy and customer experience.
If you want to disable this functionality, please turn off Wifi, Bluetooth and location services in your device settings when you visit our Knightsbridge store.
==========
To make your journey around our store more comfortable, we are continuously looking for the easiest ways to navigate our building.
While you are walking around the Knightsbridge store, we collect thermal footfall information to better understand visitor journeys and visitor ‘traffic’ levels across different parts of the store.
We also have facial-detection software at Door 3 and Door 5 of the store to measure visitor engagement with our digital advertising screens.
A camera in the screen detects if a passer-by is looking at the screen.
==========
Please note: Harrods only uses this information at a general level to understand customer footfall patterns and to provide our advertising partners with information about how many individuals look at their advertisements.
This information is not used for the purpose of identifying you individually, and any personal information is not retained.
When you participate in a Harrods competition, prize draw, giveaway or offer, or sign up to attend one of our events, either through Harrods or indirectly through a third party, we will collect information about you.
This information will be used to administer competitions and manage events, including securing your registration at an event, and selecting and contacting prize winners.
If you provide the personal information of another customer for one of our events, we will assume you have the consent of any named individuals to provide their personal information for these purposes.
Full details of our event-management partner’s privacy policy can be found on their website or on the event registration form.
Your information will be deleted shortly after the promotion or event has finished, unless you have signed up to receive marketing communications from us.
==========
The Harrods Group includes Harrods Limited, Harrods International Limited, Harrods Estates Limited, Harrods Aviation Limited and Air Harrods Limited.
Please note: we may share information provided to us by those with Harrods Rewards accounts with these Group companies.
Please visit the Harrods Estates and Harrods Aviation websites for details of their separate Privacy Policies.
==========
For your safety, and the prevention and detection of crime, CCTV is in operation during your visit to any of our retail outlets.
CCTV is also used in our outlets at Heathrow and Gatwick airports.
Please note: if the police or any other regulatory or government authority investigating suspected illegal activities requests CCTV images of you or any other personal information relating to you, we are obliged to comply.
==========
As part of our commitment to exceptional customer service, where you have provided your consent we personalise your experience by only sending marketing communications about the most exclusive products, services and events that we believe you will be interested in.
You have always been able to opt out of these communications, but now it is easier than ever to manage your preferences:
- Once you have registered for an account online, you can manage your communication preferences through our Preference Centre by signing in to your account.
- Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Service team either in-store, by email (quoting ‘Security & Privacy Enquiry’) or by phone.
You can also unsubscribe from individual email marketing communications via the ‘Unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of each of our email marketing communications.
It can take up to four weeks for your preferences to be registered on our system, so you may still receive communications from us during this period.
To learn more about your information held by us, including how to make changes to it, or request its deletion, you can (by law) make a data subject access request.
To do so, email [email protected].
Please note: we may need to exclude certain information from your request for the protection of other individuals’ privacy, or because we are permitted to exclude information for legal or other reasons.
If you would like to contact the Harrods data protection officer, please email [email protected].
==========
Our security measures are in place to keep your information secure.
Where we ask third parties to work on our behalf, we always make sure that they have sufficient information-security measures in place.
Information you provide to one of the Harrods Group companies may be shared within the Harrods Group companies.
We also work with a number of third parties to help us deliver an excellent service to you.
==========
We require all third parties that interact with Harrods undergo an information-security due diligence assessment.
This is to ensure that information is only shared where third parties have appropriate security measures in place.
We will not share your information with any third parties who might wish to market their goods and services to you unless you have provided your consent.
Harrods does not routinely share information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).
==========
If it is necessary, we will only do so with the relevant protection, in line with data protection legislation requirements.
Harrods is committed to keeping your personal information only for as long as is necessary, or where we have a legitimate interest to do so.
In cases where Harrods no longer requires personal information, eg, for analytical and research purposes or transaction information, we will remove any personal details about you.
If you have registered for an account on harrods.com and/or have a Harrods Rewards card, then we will continue to retain your personal information in order to maintain your account.
We understand that some of our customers do not shop with Harrods on a regular basis, but if you have not made a purchase with Harrods for a continuous period of four years, then we will delete your account details and all personal information that we hold about you.
==========
If you wish to use your account after this time, you will need to sign up to a new account.
If you have not registered for an account on harrods.com and/or do not have a Harrods Rewards card, but you have signed up to receive Harrods’ marketing communications, then Harrods will only retain your information for as long as we have your consent to send you marketing.
If you shop online with Harrods but use our Guest Checkout path, we will only retain your personal details for a reasonable period of time after you have completed the transaction.
This is in order to fulfil any contractual obligations such as refunds and guarantees (unless you also receive harrods.com marketing communications, in which case we will add this order information to your customer record).
Please note: if you have registered for an account on harrods.com and/or have a Harrods Rewards card, but choose to use our Guest Checkout path, we will automatically add the Guest Checkout purchase to your customer record internally.
It will not be visible on your order history page as that will only show orders through the registered user journey.
==========
If you would prefer that this does not happen, then please use a different email address not already registered with Harrods.
When you contact Harrods through any channel (including by phone, post, email or social media), we will collect information about you in order to respond to your query, request or feedback.
Please note: if you contact Harrods by phone, your call may be recorded for quality, training and security purposes.
Additionally, calls may be monitored (without your consent) to allow Harrods to collect information for security and regulatory purposes.
==========
If we specifically change the way in which we use your personal information, or if we need to notify you about a change to the information that we hold about you, we will specifically contact you.
Any future changes to our Privacy Policy will be updated online at harrods.com with the last date of update displayed as below.
We encourage you to check this site periodically to learn about the information that we collect, use and share.
The Privacy Policy was last updated in February 2020.
If you opt in to receive marketing from Cartier via our website, Cartier will use your information according to their privacy policy.
==========
Security of our website is of utmost importance to us.
Our site uses software to provide high-level encryption technology.
We use advanced security measures to protect your information against loss, misuse and alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the internet.
However, we cannot make absolute guarantees about the security of the information you provide over the internet, and as such, we cannot be held responsible for it.
==========
We will never contact you by email to request personal details.
For information of this nature, we will only contact you by telephone.
Never send any sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card information, via email.
In creating a password to access certain parts of our website, you are thereby responsible for keeping it confidential.
Please do not share a password with anyone.

The Wellness Clinic is a collaboration between Harrods and leading experts in the fields of holistic wellbeing and aesthetic medicine.
Harrods will deliver this experience to its clients whilst maintaining the highest standards of privacy.
Harrods Limited uses personal information such as your name and contact details to:
- contact you about your booking;
- contact you with any pre-treatment information or aftercare information;
- contact you with exciting information about the latest Harrods products, events and services (where you have consented);
- contact the person you provided as an emergency contact (in the case of an emergency).
Harrods will only share your personal data with the practitioner that you have booked to receive treatment from.
Full details of how your practitioner will use your personal data can be found on your registration form, which you will complete on your first visit to The Wellness Clinic.
Generally, The Wellness Clinic practitioners will use your personal data for one or more of the following reasons:
- to ensure that you are in a fit state of health to receive your chosen treatment or service;
- to craft a bespoke treatment for you;
- to contact you about your treatment;
- to demonstrate the success of a treatment or programme plan where video footage is shot or photographs are taken.
Access within this system is restricted so that only Harrods and your chosen treatment provider will be able to see your personal data.
Should you choose to visit another treatment provider, your data will not be shared with them unless you give explicit consent.
In some instances, it may be necessary for your practitioner to send your personal data outside of The Wellness Clinic – for example, when your treatment involves a DNA analysis.
In such instances, we will take the necessary steps to ensure that, instead of your name, an anonymous or pseudo-anonymous marker is used, such as a unique ID.
==========
Harrods is proud to offer clients the opportunity to experience a 3D camera.
The 3D camera shows the effects of The Wellness Clinic treatment(s) that you have received, in high-definition 3D imagery.
Whether you wish to be photographed or videotaped by the 3D camera is entirely your decision.
For some of the treatments offered within The Wellness Clinic, ‘before’ and ‘after’ photographs are mandatory.
==========
This is to demonstrate evidence of an effective treatment in case you later contest its success.
If photographs are mandatory, your treatment provider will make this clear prior to any photographs being taken.
Unless you give your explicit consent for other uses, all photographs taken of you within The Wellness Clinic will only be used to demonstrate the effect of your treatment.
==========
Louise Parker offers clients the opportunity to see and evaluate their own workout performances by recording their workouts.
Clients can access their own videos from home to help improve their technique.
This is completely optional and dependent on your preferences.
All data that you provide within The Wellness Clinic will be stored securely.
For more information about the security applied to your data, and for Harrods’ full Privacy Policy, please refer to the top of this page.
