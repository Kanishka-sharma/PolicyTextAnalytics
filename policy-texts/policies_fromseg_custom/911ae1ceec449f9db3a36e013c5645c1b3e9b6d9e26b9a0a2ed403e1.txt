KTNV Privacy Policy 
KTNV is committed to bringing you information
tailored to your individual needs, and we recognize the importance of
protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information
collected about you, our customers and prospects.
In adopting
this customer privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate
business interests in collecting and using information and your
reasonable expectations of privacy.
What personally identifiable information does
KTNV collect from me?
KTNV collects information in several ways.
Some
personal information may be gathered when you register for certain sections of our site.
During registration, KTNV may ask for information such as your
name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, zip code, and country,
and optional information regarding household income.
The more
information you volunteer, the better we are able to customize
your experience.
==========
We may also ask you for other information at
other times - such as when you enter a contest or promotion, or
when you post an online ad.
Whenever we collect information
about you, we will make an effort to link to our privacy policy.
See
the paragraph below about "cookies" and what information is
collected by means of the use of cookies.
How does KTNV use my information?
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide
you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of
sites.
This includes personalization services, interactive
communications, online shopping and many other types of
services, most of which are completely free to you.
==========
In order to
provide services free of charge, we display advertisements.
By
knowing a little about you, KTNV and its partners
are able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and
hence better service to you.
KTNV may deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of
advertisers.
Advertisers may give us an advertisement and tell us the
type of audience they want to reach (for example, females over 25
years old).
We take the advertisement and display it to users
meeting that criteria.
==========
In this process, the advertiser never has
access to individual account information.
Only KTNV
has access to individuals' accounts.
This kind of advertisement
targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional e-mail.
You will only receive special offers via e-mail from
KTNV if you have not indicated in your account
preferences that you would like not to receive them.
You can
change your account preferences at any time.
==========
KTNV may conduct research on our users' demographics,
interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us
upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or
from surveys.
We do this to better understand and serve our
users.
This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated
basis.
==========
KTNV may share this aggregated data with
advertisers or business partners.
Who is collecting information?
When you are on an area of KTNV and are asked for
personal information, you are sharing that information with KTNV, its vendors providing hosting
services for KTNV and/or its third party list
managers unless it is specifically stated otherwise.
If data is being
collected and/or maintained by any other company, you will be
notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.
If you
do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow
the transfer by not using that particular service.
Promotions that run on KTNV may be sponsored by
companies other than KTNV or may be
co-sponsored by KTNV and another company.
Some
or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the
sponsor.
If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time
of data collection or transfer.
You can decide not to participate in
the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.
==========
Currently,
most KTNV promotions are limited to U.S. or North
American residents.
Please be aware that KTNV advertisers or Web sites
that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable
information about you.
The information practices of those Web
sites linked to KTNV are not covered by this privacy
statement.
With whom does KTNV share my information?
As a general rule, KTNV will not disclose any of your
personally identifiable information except when we have your
permission or under special circumstances, such as when we
believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the
circumstances described below.
The following describes the ways
that your information may be disclosed.
Web servers serving KTNV automatically collect
information about which pages each user visits and the domain
name of visitors.
This information is used for
internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for
traffic audits.
We also provide this information (as well as
information from third-party market researchers) about our users
on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.
Any
personally identifiable information provided by subscribers online as
part of an advertiser promotion online (i.e. online coupons) may be
provided directly to advertisers.
==========
KTNV will only disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors
after you have been informed of this disclosure.
We will inform you
of the disclosures we plan to make of your personal data either
before we collect the data or before we transfer it.
You will have
an opportunity to tell us that you do not want your data disclosed
to these other entities.
If you tell us this, we may need to exclude
you from the particular promotion or other opportunity we are
providing to you.
The following sections of this policy spell out
these principles in greater detail.
==========
Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional
information from sponsors.
When you request more information
about a particular promotion, your e-mail address may be shared
with the sponsor of that promotion.
If information other than (or in
addition to) your e-mail address will be shared with the sponsor,
you will be notified at the time such additional information is
collected from you.
If you make a purchase from a store or a merchant, the information obtained during your visit to those stores (including tracking information and cookies as described
below as well as the information you give such as your credit card
number and contact information) is provided to the merchants.
This is to enable transactions to take place.
==========
Merchants listed on KTNV  have
separate privacy and data collection practices.
KTNV has no responsibility or liability for these
independent policies.
For more information regarding the merchant,
their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home
page and click on the appropriate link.
==========
Under confidentiality agreements, KTNV may match aggregated user
information with third party data.
Also, KTNV
discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third
parties, and for other lawful purposes.
A user's personally identifiable information (e.g., name,
e-mail address) may be used by KTNV for editorial
purposes.
==========
For example, we may use information provided by you to
us as part of an online survey conducted by our editors.
If we run competitions or contests on the site, you may be
required to provide information such as your telephone number and
address in order to participate.
The exact rules may vary in each
case but the specific rules for any contest will state how that
information may be used.
==========
Unless you have told us that you would
prefer not to receive e-mail from us, we may send you e-mails
about KTNV products, promotions, or services as
well as on behalf of other companies.
Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection,
a user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to
a party outside KTNV, its vendors providing Internet hosting services or advertising services
or third party list managers unless stated at the time of collection.
If you do not wish to receive any e-mail or to have us share such
information with another party, you may "opt out" at any time by
(i) clicking the box on the registration form or the updated
membership profile form requesting us not to e-mail you or to share
such information, (ii) e-mailing us at koonce@ktnv.com.
==========
KTNV may also disclose
account information in special cases when we have reason to
believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
violating our Membership Agreement or may be causing injury to or
interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)
KTNV's rights or property, other
KTNV users, or anyone else that could be harmed
by such activities.
What are cookies and how does KTNV use
them?
KTNV places a "cookie" on the browser of a
KTNV user's computer to store and sometimes track
information about you.
A cookie can be used to tell when your
computer has contacted a Web site; we use the information for
editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring
certain traffic patterns.
For example, cookies are used to ensure
that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session.
We may also use cookies to track your progress and number of
entries in some of our promotions and contests.
==========
Advertising
networks that serve ads into our site may also use their own
cookies.
Opting-Out of Online Advertising Cookies 

KTNV delivers online advertising on its network of sites.
KTNV's ad management system may place cookies on
users' hard drives so that their systems can identify your
computer.
By placing such cookies on your system, the ad management system is able, among other things, to determine
automatically whether you have seen a particular advertisement
before and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.
It also
enables the ad management system to serve you advertisements
tailored to things you have shown interest in based on other sites
you have visited.
Some people are uncomfortable with this kind of
information gathering.
KTNV allows visitors
the option to opt-out of advertising cookies.
If you do not want
the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you
to deny or accept this feature.
You can make such changes in the preferences/options section of your chosen Web browser(s) software.
==========
Some advertisers contract with a third-party service to host
their ads.
In that case, an
independent cookie may be used by the third-party service.
We do
not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of vendors with
whom we do not have a contractual relationship.
==========
We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners,
advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide
hyperlinks.
KTNV users should also be aware that,
when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or
message boards, that information may be collected by others and
may result in unsolicited messages from others.
Note for Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us -
including information like your name, address, or e-mail address.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
children under 13.
In the event that we learn that we have
collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13
without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
information from our database as quickly as possible.
