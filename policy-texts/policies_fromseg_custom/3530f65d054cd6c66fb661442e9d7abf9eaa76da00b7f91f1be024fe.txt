AdMaxim Privacy Policy
Updated: 12 April 2018
AdMaxim Inc. (“AdMaxim”) is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence in Online advertising and marketing.
Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines including those established by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the Direct Marketing Association and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) by the European Union.
==========
We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while seeking to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences  to users on behalf of our clients.
The document outlines AdMaxim policy to provide clear notice about the user information we may collect and process online in connection with our Services.
Information We Receive and Process Through our Services
The objective of our Services is to serve you content and advertisements which are relevant to you.
To achieve this, we use our technology to process and store data about you relating to interests, location, content consumption (Mobile Web and Apps) and demographic profiles.
==========
The information we gather does not allow us to know who you are.
Therefore neither we, nor any of our clients to whom we provide information, know who you are.
==========
Personally identifiable information (“PII”): We do not process or store personally identifiable information (“PII”) that directly identifies an individual.
PII is information which can be used to identify a specific individual directly, and typically consists of information such as name, address, email address or telephone number.
If you choose to send us your PII, for example by emailing us, we will only use this information for the purposes of responding to the matter in your enquiry.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”): We do process and store non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) that indirectly identifies an individual.
NPII is information which by itself cannot be used to identify a specific individual directly, and typically includes Advertising Ids (IDFA – Apple iOS and AdID – Android) are user resettable privacy friendly identifiers which can be blocked or reset (effectively disassociating their actual device id from any profiles that have been built using that Advertising Id).
Encrypted Data stored in the AdMaxim system is based on an internally generated id based on the user Advertising Id.
AdMaxim System uses proprietary hashing algorithms to Anonymise data subject’s Advertising Ids and demographic/behaviour data linked to the Advertising Ids.
==========
This type of information does not allow us to know who is using a computer or mobile device.
Any reference to ‘you, your, consumer, user’ is to a pseudonymous user or users of a computer or device.
==========
Encrypted Data stored in the AdMaxim system is based on an internally generated id based on the user Advertising Id.
Profile Ids stored in our system are anonymised and cannot be used to identify any individual directly or indirectly without using our algorithms to convert it back to Advertising Ids.
Both categories above PII and NPII are types of personal data – PII can be used to directly identify an individual and NPII can be used to indirectly identify an individual.
The data we process and store does not use actual Device Ids or behaviour profiles linked to Device Ids.
Generating an internal id based on the privacy friendly Android and iOS ids and then using strong encryption and obfuscation of data ensures that AdMaxim is meeting the required security and privacy levels that individuals have a right to expect.
AdMaxim Profiles allow us to identify behaviour and attributes and serve relevant ads and content to users without directly identifying you.
The decision to select the most relevant content and advertisement is automated through the use of sophisticated algorithms.
Behaviour profiles are created in the system using the data and techniques described above.
==========
Purpose of Collecting Data
Using the collected NPII, AdMaxim enables delivery of relevant content and advertising campaigns on behalf of Brands and Agencies that are interested in delivering products and services to individuals.
Anonymised profiles  based on user interest, demographic information, content consumption history, location and other behaviour attributes allow AdMaxim to increase relevance of content/advertisements that are being delivered to individuals.
