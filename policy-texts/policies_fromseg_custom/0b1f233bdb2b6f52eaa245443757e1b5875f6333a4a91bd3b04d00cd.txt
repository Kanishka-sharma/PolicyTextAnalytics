1.
==========
WHAT DATA WE COLLECT
Infinia has entered into agreements with several apps and mobile webs owners (Infinia partners) to install a Software Development Kit (SDK) to collect device-specific information when users install / visit those apps and mobile webs.
Information gathered through Infinia SDK is basically as follows:



iOS


Device:  Advertising ID, Apps installed on the phone, operator company, SDK platform, mobile device model, mobile device manufacturer, name of the overall product, Android version, Wi-Fi network, type of network, mobile network, screen density, width and height, memory Ram, language, country and timestamp.
Push registration: Push Notification Token.
Location: Longitude and Latitude, Altitude, Accuracy and Speed and Course.
Android

Device: Apple Advertising ID, Device Carrier mobile codes, WiFi SSID, Network Type and Subtype, Device Platform and Manufacturer, Device Model, Device SO version, Screen size and density, Country and Language and Bundle Identifier from the host application.
Location: latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, course in degrees, estimated accuracy of location, timestamp.
Registration (Push): SDK version, publisher app version, Android platform, token, timestamp.
==========
Navigation history: page title, url page, bookmark, number of visits and timestamp.
Mobile web

Device:  mobile device model, mobile device manufacturer, operating system, web browser, screen density, country and timestamp.
Location: latitude, longitude.
==========
Hereinafter, "Raw Data".
Infinia SDK does NOT collect personal data associated to an identified natural person such as name, surname, email address, telephone number, IP, etc.
Infinia does not know who the owner or user of the mobile device is.
We do not link the Raw Data to personal data available in the internet or public sources related to an identified or identifiable individual.
==========
All Raw Data obtained from a particular mobile device is grouped around the advertising ID, a unique anonymous identifier of the mobile device that is used for advertising purposes.
An advertising ID is not a persistent identifier as it may be reset by the user.
If reset, a new advertising ID is assigned now, and advertisers cannot link past actions anymore to the device if only the advertising ID was used for that.
The Raw Data obtained by the Infinia SDK when a mobile device visits an app or mobile web of one of our partners is combined with the Raw Data gathered when that same mobile device visits the apps or mobile webs of other partners of Infinia.
We apply data analytics methods to the results of such combination that allows us to infer an estimated profile of the mobile device user: estimated age, gender, socioeconomic level, home, workplace, vital zone, nationality, etc. (hereinafter, the "Aggregated Data").
2.
WHAT PURPOSES WE USE THE DATA FOR 
Aggregated Data is used by Infinia to generate audience clusters demanded by our customers (advertising agencies and announcers) and to serve tailored advertising in apps and mobile webs through the Infinia Advertising Platform.
3.
==========
WHAT DATA WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES
We share the Raw Data and Aggregated Data with our partners (i.e., the owners of the apps and mobile webs where Infinia SDK is installed), based on the users' consent when downloading the app or visiting the mobile web.
We do not share any Raw Data or Aggregated Data that could be considered personal data.
WHERE WE STORE THE DATA
The Raw Data and the Aggregated Data are stored within the European Union by Infinia and third parties such as data-centers and hosting providers which Infinia has entered into service and data processing agreements with.
Our hosting providers are ISO 27001 certified.
5.
WHAT SECURITY MEASURES WE HAVE IN PLACE
We are committed to protect Infinia and users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we store and process on Infinia Advertising Platform.
==========
In particular:


We encrypt many of our communications using SSL.
We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict access to personal information to Infinia employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be penalized or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
6.
==========
WHAT CHOICES WE OFFER FOR USERS TO OBJECT THE DATA COLLECTION
6.1 Opting Out Infinia’s Data Processing.
Our main purpose is to be clear about what information we collect, so that users can make informed choices about how it is used.
Users have the following options: 
a) They may reject their consent to the collection of the Raw Data through Infinia SDKs installed on apps and mobile webs of Infinia's partners.
When downloading an app or visiting a mobile web of one of our partners, users are asked whether they consent to the collection of the Raw Data.
==========
If they refuse their consent, Infinia SDK does not collect any Raw Data and therefore such data is not used to generate the Aggregated Data and audience clusters for serving tailored advertising.
b) Even though users have initially consented the collection of Raw Data through Infinia SDKs, they may easily withdraw such consent directly with Infinia.
To do so, users may send an email to privacy@infiniamobile.com and provide the advertising ID of their mobile device for Infinia to remove all the Aggregated Data linked to that advertising ID and to stop receiving tailored advertising from Infinia.
