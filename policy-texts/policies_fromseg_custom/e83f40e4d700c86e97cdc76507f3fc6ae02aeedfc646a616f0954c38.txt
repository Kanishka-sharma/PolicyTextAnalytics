Scope of the Privacy Policy
                This Web site (the "Site") is operated by the National Geographic Society and our subsidiary, NGHT, LLC, which also is known as nationalgeographic.com.
We refer to these organizations collectively as "National Geographic," "we" or "our."
National Geographic understands the importance of our customers' privacy.
==========
Our Privacy Policy tells you what personally identifiable information we collect about you when you visit our Site, how we use, share and protect it, what choices you have about how this information is used, and how you can access and update that information.
If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site.
This Site offers certain content, activities, games and services, which are referred to as the "Services."
==========
This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information collected on the Site where this Privacy Policy is posted, with the exception of the sections of this Site that are intended for visits from children under the age of 13, including www.nationalgeographic.com/kids, www.nationalgeographic.com/ngexplorer, and certain online features specifically designed for kids.
In recognition of the need to provide additional privacy protections for children, we have a separate privacy policy that applies to those sections.

==========
Certain aspects of this Privacy Policy also apply to the personally identifiable information we collect offline.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personally identifiable information" means information that identifies and can be used to contact a particular individual, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number.
When other information, such as e-mail newsletter choices, magazine or product purchases, or consumer product preferences, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information.
Personal Information Collections
Personally Identifiable Information We Collect Directly
Although you may access this Site without registering, if you are interested in obtaining information, products or services from National Geographic, or in participating in certain activities on this Site (such as making an online purchase, subscribing to one of our magazines, becoming a member of National Geographic, making an online donation to National Geographic, or participating in sweepstakes, contests, surveys, or certain special initiatives), you may need to provide us with information about yourself.
For example, if you order a product from us, we ask for your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and your credit card number.
If you are ordering a product as a gift for another person, we will ask you for that person's name, postal address and phone number in order to enable us to deliver the gift to the recipient.
==========
If you participate in an activity such as a survey or sweepstakes, we may also ask you to provide other types of information such as gender and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information that we have obtained about you.
In addition, we may combine personally identifiable information that you have provided to us with other information that is publicly available or that we receive from other sources.
Other Information Collected Through Technology
In addition to information you choose to provide to us, we also use standard Internet technologies to collect automatically certain additional information.
==========
For instance, when you come to our site, we collect your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which identifies the computer or service provider that you use to access the Site.
We may use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which specific visitors visit various parts of our sites.
We may combine this information with personally identifiable information that we have collected to make our Site and communications more targeted to your interests.
==========
Our Site also uses cookies.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer and allow web sites to remember information about users.
We use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to enhance the quality of our Site.
We use transient (also called "session ID") cookies to provide continuity from page to page.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
==========
We also use persistent cookies.
Persistent cookies allow our online store and other parts of our Site to recognize your browser when you return after your first visit to that part of our Site.
Cookies allow us to personalize your return visits to our site and to save you time during certain activities, such as checking out from our online store.
You can choose to remove persistent cookies through your browser options.
However, if you do so, your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited, such as our shopping cart feature or online games.
Also, the Site uses other tracking tools, including web beacons.
Web beacons are images on the Site (or in emails that the Site sends to you) that help us determine what parts of our Site you have visited, whether you have opened an email that we have sent to you, or otherwise to measure the effectiveness of the Site.
==========
These technical methods may involve the transmission of information directly to us or to a service provider authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.
The information from use of these technical methods may be combined with information that is personally identifiable so that we can make our Site, and any emails you have agreed to receive, more interesting to you.
Third-Party Advertisements
We have a relationship with one or more third party advertising companies, including Doubleclick and Google, which display the advertisements that appear on this Site.
Our advertising partners may use information about you that we provide, such as your age, gender, or interests, or the features within the Site that you choose to use, to target and serve advertisements to you and to analyze the delivery of advertisements on the Site.
However, we will not provide personally identifiable information about you to our advertising partners, except as otherwise permitted under this policy.
These third party advertising partners also collect information on this Site, including through use of cookies and web beacons, and use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our Site.
For more information about DoubleClick, cookies and how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, please visit the DoubleClick opt-out page or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
Click here for more information about how we use a third party service to collect and use information on this Site.
We also may share aggregated information with third parties (such as third-party sponsors) to help us develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.
This aggregated information cannot be used to identify you personally.
Personal Information Use
National Geographic may use your personally identifiable information to deliver the products and services that you request, enhance your experience on our site, provide you with informational and/or promotional materials that you might find interesting, and for internal business analysis and other business purposes consistent with this policy.
These uses may generally be categorized as relationship maintenance uses and promotional uses.
We describe these uses in more detail below.
==========
Relationship Maintenance Uses

National Geographic uses your personally identifiable information to maintain and manage your account, deliver services that you have requested, and generally enhance your experience on our Web site.
Collectively, we refer to these types of uses as "Relationship Maintenance Uses," and they include all of the ways in which we use your personally identifiable information to maintain and manage our relationship with you that do not involve sending promotional materials.
Examples of Relationship Maintenance Uses include, but are not limited to:



Processing and tracking your membership and magazine subscriptions
Processing and tracking your product orders
Processing and tracking your online donations to National Geographic
Providing the services you request
Contacting you about the status of an order
Sending you magazine renewal notifications
Sending you other administrative communications
Sending you surveys
Sending you updates to our privacy policy
Making changes to Web-based features


Promotional Uses

National Geographic may also use your personally identifiable information to provide you with promotional information about activities, services and products offered by us or selected third parties, including promotional material that you have requested.
We strive to select trustworthy, reputable companies who offer high quality products or services of interest to you.
==========
(However, you may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by mail, e-mail, or telephone, as explained below and in the section entitled "Your Choices."
And, we will not share your e-mail address with third parties for promotional purposes unless you consent to such sharing by affirmatively agreeing to it).
Examples of promotional uses include, but are not limited to:



Providing you with information about educational opportunities
Providing you with promotional materials about National Geographic products and services
Providing you with e-mail newsletters



National Geographic may provide you with promotional materials by postal mail, e-mail, telephone or other means.
You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by mail, e-mail and/or telephone as provided in the "Your Choices" section below, and in the case of e-mail, you can always opt out of receiving subsequent promotional e-mails by clicking on the unsubscribe link that we provide in every such promotional e-mail message.
Please keep in mind, however, that when you purchase or request products or services from National Geographic or our licensees, promotional materials may accompany delivery of that product or service.
Any opt-outs that you may make will therefore not apply to these materials because they accompany products or services that you have requested.
==========
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We take very seriously our responsibility to maintain your privacy with respect to your personally identifiable information.
We will therefore share that information only with the following entities, and only in the manner described below.
Service Providers
National Geographic contracts with other companies to provide certain services on our behalf, including credit card processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, and promotions management.
We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services, and they are permitted to use the information only for that specific purpose or as required by law, unless any additional use or sharing of the information is separately permitted under another provision of this Privacy Policy.
==========
National Geographic Licensees
We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties that offer products and/or services under or in association with brand names of National Geographic.
These third parties are called "licensees," and some examples include, but are not limited to:



Tour operators that offer expeditions under the National Geographic brand name
The bank that issues the National Geographic Mastercard
The company that offers you the National Geographic holiday greeting card program



You can tell when a licensee offers one of our products or services, because our name appears on the product or on materials describing the service, or the licensee's name appears jointly with ours.
These licensees are restricted by contract from using your personally identifiable information that we share with them for any marketing or promotional purpose that is not related to their National Geographic licensed product or service.
To protect your rights, the use of your personally identifiable information by our licensees is subject to the same opt-out rights (and limitations upon those rights) that apply to the use of personally identifiable information by National Geographic and that are described below in the section entitled "Your Choices."
However, if you choose to access or purchase a product or service that is offered by one of our licensees, that licensee may in some cases then collect your personally identifiable information subject to its own privacy practices.
Because we do not control the privacy practices of our licensees, you should review their practices before you choose to access their products and services.
==========
Co-Branded Partners
National Geographic may share your information with our partners when you engage in certain activities on our sites that they co-sponsor, such as purchasing products or services offered by our partners, electing to receive information or communications from our partners, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by our partners.
National Geographic may also share your personally identifiable information when you respond to promotional materials from National Geographic that authorize our partners to use your personally identifiable information for purposes such as sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game.
We refer to all these activities and requests as "Co-Branded Activities."
When you participate in Co-Branded Activities, you will either be required or asked to agree that the sponsor or partner may use your personally identifiable information in accordance with the sponsor or partner's privacy practices.
==========
Subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities
National Geographic has a number of subsidiary and affiliated entities ("Affiliates") that offer a wide range of products and services.
One example is NGT, Inc., which operates the National Geographic Channel in the United States.
We may share your personally identifiable information with our Affiliates so they can let you know about product and service offerings in which you might be interested.
The use of your personally identifiable information by our Affiliates is subject to the same opt-out rights (and limitations upon those rights) that apply to the use of personally identifiable information by National Geographic and that are described below in the section entitled "Your Choices."
Other Third Parties for Promotional Purposes
National Geographic may share your personally identifiable information with other selected third parties so that they may send you promotional materials about goods and services that they offer.
When we share your information for promotional purposes, we attempt to select only reputable companies that offer high-quality products and services.
You have the opportunity to opt out of our sharing your personally identifiable information with these selected third parties for promotional purposes, as described below in the section entitled "Your Choices."
And we will not share your e-mail address with third parties for promotional purposes unless you consent to such sharing by affirmatively agreeing to it on our e-mail newsletter registration page or elsewhere.
==========
Legal Purposes; Business Transactions
National Geographic may disclose any user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, when we believe that doing so is required by law; may be necessary to protect the property, rights, or safety of ourselves, visitors to our Web sites, or other persons; or will help to enforce any terms of use or contest, sweepstakes, promotions, games or other rules.
It may also be necessary to disclose our customers' personally identifiable information to third parties, such as credit card companies, to help resolve disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business.
National Geographic may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

National Geographic may share with third parties aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Web site.
When we do this, however, we make any personally identifiable information non-personally identifiable by combining it with information about other individuals or by removing characteristics that make the information personally identifiable to you.
We share this information in order to improve our Web site and develop content and services that we hope will be of interest to you.
Your Choices
We understand the importance of protecting our customers' privacy, and we therefore provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information used or disclosed for certain purposes.

==========
Links to Other Sites
We may provide links on our Web site to other sites we think you will enjoy.
These sites operate independently of National Geographic and have established their own privacy and security policies.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read these policies at any site you visit.
==========
Information Security
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us, and we take a number of steps to safeguard any personally identifiable information or credit card information that you provide to us.
We use data encryption technology to help protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your credit card information.
Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encrypt the credit card information sent between your computer and our database.
However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.
==========
Personally Identifiable Information Contained in User Content
Some sections of our Web site may allow users to post or transmit messages, comments, screen names, computer files and other materials.
National Geographic does not monitor such transmissions, and therefore cannot be responsible for any personally identifiable information or other information that may be contained in such transmissions.
Children's Privacy
Other than certain sections of this Web site that are intended for visits from children under the age of 13—including www.nationalgeographic.com/kids and www.nationalgeographic.com/ngexplorer—our Web site is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children.
Should a child whom we know to be under 13 make known to us his or her personally identifiable information, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personally identifiable information.
==========
Changes in this Privacy Policy
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.
If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Web sites covered by this Privacy Policy.
In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of personally identifiable information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes.
