For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.8.2 As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Sites (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services.
Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“Interest-based Advertising”).8.3 Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at  https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.8.4 The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads.
