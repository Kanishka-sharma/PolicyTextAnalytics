Startribune.com has a firm commitment to privacy.
We take your privacy concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address them as we strive to offer our site visitors a high quality, interactive and personalized experience.
That is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on information gathering and how we intend to use and share any information we collect.
It is important to note that this policy applies only to information collected by startribune.com and does not apply to information obtained or used by Star Tribune or its affiliates through other means.
Startribune.com collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address, e-mail address, etc.
What information we collect and store depends on the page you are visiting and the services you elect to participate in.
We use this information to operate our services, provide you with the highest quality services, offer you opportunities we think will be of interest, and better tailor the advertising you see from us to suit you.

This information is not shared with anyone outside of Star Tribune and startribune.com except as provided for in this Privacy Policy.
More specifics on the information we collect are outlined within this policy.
This privacy policy is subject to change from time to time.
If the policy is revised, a notice will be placed in the Member Center where registered members of our service may also update their personal information, subscribe to e-mail newsletters and revise the permissions that they previously granted startribune.com.
They may also receive an e-mail outlining the change.
Non-registered users of startribune.com may view the privacy policy, including any revisions, by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on the home page of startribune.com.
