Consumer Reports Online will not sell, rent, swap, or otherwise disclose to any third party any information provided during your subscription registration.
In addition, we do not include on our site any functionality allowing third parties to perform "reverse searches" to identify individuals from e-mail addresses.
==========
We ask you to explicitly "opt-in" to give us your permission to send notification of special 
		Consumer Reports Online events and updates or news about other Consumer Reports Activities.
You may opt-in 
		immediately following the registration process or at any time afterward on our 
		E-mail notices page.
Of course, if you change your mind, you can always change your option and remove your 
		name from any list.
==========
For Consumer Reports Online subscribers, we reserve the right to send subscription maintenance mails, such as order confirmation, renewal/expire notice, and credit card problem notifications, and infrequent Service Alert messages, regardless of the opt-in status.
The purpose of the Service Alert messages are to inform subscribers of specific changes that may impact their ability to use our site.

CRO conducts surveys to better understand our users.
All survey information is voluntarily disclosed and will not be associated with the individual users.
Cookies are used to track what surveys already have been presented, to avoid users from being presented with or submitting duplicate surveys.
We do evaluate site usage by analyzing user information in the aggregate, in a way that does not identify any individual user.
We maintain a secure process for collection, transmission, and storage of subscription registration 
			information.
See our Security page for more details.
