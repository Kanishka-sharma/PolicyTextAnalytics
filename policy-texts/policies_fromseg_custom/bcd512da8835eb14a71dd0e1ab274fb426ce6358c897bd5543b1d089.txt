Subway and its online advertising and marketing partners may employ various technologies to collect information including:
3.1.1.3.
==========
Cookies
Like many other websites, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain web pages to help analyze our web page flow and measure promotional effectiveness.
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.
==========
This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our website and services.
A few important things you should know about cookies:

FWH offers certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
FWH uses cookies to better your website experience.
FWH uses cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.
==========
Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the websites that FWH does not control.
(For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)
Cookies are also used on mobile devices to run the Subway® App.
==========
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.
However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of the Sites if cookies are disabled.
If you use Sites that employ Flash Player, a small Flash Cookie may be used.
The purpose of using these cookies is to store your flash player preferences and to enhance your browsing experience.
Flash cookies are stored on your computer in a similar way that standard cookies are stored on your computer, except they are stored in a different location.
For that reason, it is not possible to block or manage Flash Cookies directly from your browser.
For additional information, and in order to manage or delete Flash Cookies, please visit Adobe's website by clicking here:  https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.
3.1.1.4.
==========
Web Beacons
FWH uses web beacons, also called “web bugs,” “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs, to help manage FWH’s online advertising and promotions.
Used in combination with cookies, a web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which is placed on a website or in an email, that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the email.
When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a website to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values.
==========
Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a website.
A web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the website.
Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking the user's activity.
The web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.
FWH uses its web beacons to track which advertisements and promotions bring users to FWH’s website.
This information does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address.
3.1.1.5.
==========
Cross-Device Tracking
Subway participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, which helps companies build websites, applications and advertisements that seamlessly flow between all your devices (devices could include a desktop, laptop, tablet, phone or smart watch).
The Device Co-op recognizes which of your devices are linked – used by the same person— through use of technology that includes cookies and your IP address (without collecting your personal information).
Visit the Adobe website for more information on cross-device tracking and/or to unlink your devices.
3.1.1.6.
