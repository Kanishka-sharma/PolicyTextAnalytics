Terms of Service

General
          The Gator Corporation (“TGC”) provides you with access to this web site and the search services available on this web site (the “Services”) on the condition that you accept these Terms of Service (“TOS”).
By accessing or using the Services, you indicate your assent to be bound by this TOS, and your acknowledgment of and agreement to its terms.
==========
Services
          The Services include SearchScout that enables you to conduct keyword searches on the Internet and the World Wide Web.
The results of your keyword searches are comprised of hypertext links to third party web pages.
The owners of such third party web pages may or may not have paid to be listed as a result to your search query.
==========
Content Linked by TGC
          TGC uses reasonable efforts to ensure the availability of the information and content, including the search result links that it makes available through the Services.
The web pages linked by the search results, however, are not owned or controlled by TGC and, therefore, TGC:  (i) assumes no responsibility, and is not liable for, the availability of such web pages; and (ii) assumes no responsibility, and is not liable for, the content provided or available through such web pages.
TGC is not involved in any transactions between you and any of the web pages linked by the search results, and is not responsible for, and does not guarantee the price or performance of any goods, services or information provided by any web page linked by search results.
==========
A search using SearchScout may produce search results and links to web pages that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive.
We cannot guarantee that using SearchScout will not locate unintended or objectionable content and assume no responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to by SearchScout.
==========
Only Personal Use is Authorized—No Bots, Spiders, or Overloading of the Services
          TGC grants you access to use the Services and to print a copy of the search results only for your personal use.
You may copy, distribute and transmit the content of the Services only to the extent that such copying, distribution, and transmission is automatically done through your browser software incidentally to using the Services for your personal use.
Except as set forth above, you may not modify, reformat, copy, display, distribute, transmit, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer or sell any information, products, or service obtained by your use of the Services.
You may not mirror on your own Web site any portion of the Services or display through your own Web site any results pages or other information from the Services.
You agree that you will not use any automated means, including, without limitation, agents, robots, scripts, or spiders, to access, monitor or copy the Services except those automated means expressly made available by TGC, if any, or authorized in advance and in writing by TGC (for example, TGC approved third party tools and services).
==========
Without limitation to the foregoing, you further agree that you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure (as reasonably determined by TGC).
Ownership of the Services
          The SearchScout Web site, its content, and the underlying technology is owned by TGC and/or its licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property or proprietary rights.
Except as expressly granted to you in this TOS, TGC and its licensors retain all rights, title and interest in and to the SearchScout Web site, its content, and the underlying technology.
==========
Privacy and Data Collection
          TGC does not collect personally identifying information from users of the Services unless users have explicitly given such information to TGC (for example, when sending us an e-mail with a question or as part of a contest).
TGC's information practices are further described in its privacy statement www.tgcsearch.com/privacystatement/.
TGC's privacy policy is part of this Agreement, and you agree that use of data as described in the privacy policy is not an actionable breach of your privacy or publicity rights.
==========
Release
          If you have a dispute with one or more web pages linked by the search results, you agree to release and hereby release TGC (and TGC's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, successors, assigns, content providers and service providers) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
If applicable, you waive California Civil Code section 1542, which says:
          "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."
