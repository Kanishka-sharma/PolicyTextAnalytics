Advertising, Content Serving and Web Analytics Technology
Optomaton’s technology is used by its customers—advertising agencies, advertisers and publishers—to create and deliver rich and diverse online marketing campaigns using modern technology and innovative tools.
==========
Optomaton supports strict online privacy and security standards.
Optomaton continuously educates advertisers, agencies and partners to ensure that these parties are aware of and vigilant in preventing any security or privacy breaches that could affect you, media sites or other parties.
Optomaton’s technology allows advertisers to collect and store non-identifying data about Internet users and use them for analysis and online behavioural advertisements.
As a result, such advertisements offer an enriched online experience and deliver advertisement content that is likely to be more interesting and relevant to Internet users.
Data Collection
To decide which ads to display, such as showing similar products to those a visitor has looked at before.
==========
Optomaton uses a cookie mechanism for this purpose, but only on an anonymous basis.
This means that Optomaton stores no personal information such as email addresses, names or addresses in the cookie or in the cookie-based profile.
A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on a computer when, with a browser, a user views advertisements or websites of one of Optomaton’s clients.
The cookie does not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or anything that personally identifies the user.
Instead the cookie contains information as such as a random identification number, opt-out or opt-in choice options.
Using the cookies’ random identification numbers, Optomaton collects and stores in the cookie-based profiles anonymous information such as: operating system, browser version, geographic location, URLs on which Optomaton displays advertisements, or facts about interactions with advertisements (such as number of clicks or views).
During web requests to Optomaton web-servers, our system is exposed to the IP addresses from internet users.
==========
Optomaton is in full compliance with local data privacy laws and is anonymizing the data according to local regulations.
Optomaton does not pass this data to any third party or use this data for any other purposes than analysis on behalf of the site owners.
Usage of Collected Data for Advertisements
The collected data can be used in four different ways for online behavioural advertisements.
==========
They can be used for the following tasks: displaying ads in a sequence, displaying particular products in response to interest, displaying ads based on statistical probabilities, or deciding if an ad should be shown based on responses to the above techniques.
Display Ads in a Sequence
First, ads can be shown in a sequence by using a cookie with a random identification number.
By remembering which ads have been shown to each number, Optomaton offers advertisers the possibility to only show the same ad a specific number of times, before showing other or no ads.
Display Particular Products in Response to Interest
Based on the random identification number in the cookie, Optomaton for a certain period stores the information that interest was shown in a particular product or advertiser in terms of, for example, a click, visit, mouse-over, search or similar interaction tracked by the advertiser.
Based on this information, the advertiser can create ads that display the same or similar products of possible interest.
Therefore, an ad on the same browser with the same random identification number can be used to display more products that are relevant.
==========
This technology is sometimes used on the advertiser’s website to recommend other products.
Display Ads Based on Statistical Probabilities
Optomaton uses data based on thousands of users that respond to ads and products to show the viewer particular products or ads.
This means that actions such as clicking on an ad or visiting an advertiser’s website are anonymously aggregated and used to select the ads to show you and other users.
==========
Therefore, if cookies with similar characteristics to that of a given viewer indicate interest in an advertisement, then it is very likely that this advertisement will appear.
Deciding if an Ad Should Be Shown Based on Responses to the Above Techniques
All the above techniques can be used not only to decide what ad to show, but also whether to show it.
Through real-time-bidding or similar technologies, advertisers can use the above technologies for deciding who it is relevant to display their ads for and not showing it to others.
==========
When using the collected data for advertising purposes, Optomaton conforms to all applicable laws as well as standards e.g. Self-regulation Framework for Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA), released by IAB Europe, which allows consumers to opt out of behaviour tracking by our technology.
Accordingly, Optomaton does not target sensitive segments of the audience, such as children under 12 or others considered sensitive by the IAB Europe Self-regulation Framework for OBA.
Data Collection on Behalf of Third Parties
Optomaton does not allow collection or storage of any type of sensitive personal data.
Data that are not sensitive but can be used to identify an individual, such as addresses or telephone numbers, are also not collected or stored unless provided voluntarily by an individual Internet user.
Any such information is only available for use by the particular advertiser to whom the individual has supplied his or her data.
Advertisers are limited by contract to use these data solely for the purposes, identified in the advertisement, of providing Internet users with requested products, services or information as established in that advertiser’s privacy policy.
==========
Although it is permitted, Optomaton does not encourage customers to use its technology for collection or storage of personal identification data.
In all such cases, Optomaton provides only secure data storage and access to the data control services with no other use of those data.
Optomaton does not assume responsibility for the advertisers’ use of these voluntarily supplied data.
Optomaton does not distribute this information to any party other than those indicated in the advertising agreement.
Links to Other Sites
Ads served by Optomaton usually link to other web sites, which may have privacy assurance practices that differ from ours.
Optomaton does not control and cannot be held responsible for the content of these web sites.
To make sure your privacy is protected, please consult the respective privacy policy of the web site you are visiting.
==========
Data Security and Protection
Optomaton implements reasonable security measures to protect all data collected and used by Optomaton technology.
At every step, Optomaton adapts all relevant security and safety practices, and employs modern security hardware and software provided by recognized world-leading manufacturers.
Physical environment security is also ensured; thus, Optomaton solutions are hosted and data are stored only in Tier 3 or Tier 4 data centres, classified according to official data centre classification.
Optomaton Allows Internet Users to Opt out of

cookie-based targeted advertisements using Optomaton technology for online behavioural advertisements (OBAs),
tracking of visits across domains of different media or advertisers’ sites through Optomaton technology,
any type of cookie-based tracking by third-party technology through optomaton.
==========
The opt-out process erases all previously collected data and places an alternative Optomaton cookie into the Internet user’s browser with special indication of an “opt-out” choice and with no other data.
The cookie applies to the specific computer and browser only.
If an Internet user wishes to opt out on other browsers or computers, he or she must repeat the process.
Please also note that if all cookies are erased from the computer, the opt-out cookie is also erased and the process must be repeated.
When a user opts out, Optomaton will no longer:

identify the user by the unique identifier normally stored in the Optomaton ad-serving cookie.
Users therefore in many cases receive the same ad repeatedly because rotations of ads are based on the unique user identifier,
display personalized ads based on user interests,
collect any data about the user’s interactions with online advertisement and online experience on the web sites,
facilitate similar actions or collection of information for such purposes by other targeting systems used together with Optomaton.
