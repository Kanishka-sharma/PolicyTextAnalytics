Data Collection
HyperTV does not collect personal data while visiting one of its domains.

HyperTV considers online data privacy as one of its primary values, and follows regulatory initiatives such as those of the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) of the European Union EU (ePrivacy regulation and GDPR).
Use of data collected in advertising
HyperTV, through its "connected-stories" platform, allows the creation of online advertising messages based on multiple displays.
==========
They are provided to a user according to a predefined sequence called "user journey".
HyperTV collects information through tracking cookies, or similar technologies, resident on the user's browser.
These technologies allow the browser to be recognized, once advertising has been provided, so as to be able to provide it with the correct element of the sequence.
A user can control the use of cookies at individual browser level.
He can choose to disable cookies, even if it may limit the use of certain features offered by websites.
==========
Thanks to these technologies, HyperTV associates "tags" to visitors of its partners' websites, or those websites where advertising is shown through HyperTV.
These users' browsers are associated with a unique alphanumeric identifier.
In no way does HyperTV collect data that can identify a person, such as a name or an address.
HyperTV, keeps track of the advertising elements displayed to a user so that it can provide him with the expected element in the sequence.
HyperTV often provides its Connected Stories through intermediary partners distributing ads on the multiple sites of the so-called "Publishers".
The latter can put cookies on the user's browser, so that they can recognize that HyperTV has provided Connected Stories for that user.
Their use is governed by specific publisher privacy policies that can be viewed directly from their websites.
==========
HyperTV does not allow the collection or storage of any kind of sensitive data.
Data that is not sensitive, but that could be used to identify an individual, such as an address, telephone number or email address, is neither collected nor stored.
When using the collected data, HyperTV complies with all applicable laws and standards as, for example, those issued by IAB Europe.
