==========
How we protect your personal information         We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
==========
We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure e-mail.
Please refer to the  Federal Trade Commission’s website for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
==========
Reviews         We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others as well as reviews of products, establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.).
Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service.
In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.
==========
Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your e-mail address, you may receive unsolicited messages.
We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Once you have posted information, you will not be able to edit or delete such information.
