Overall privacy statement
CNET Networks takes your privacy seriously.
==========
Because we gather certain types of information about our users we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information.
This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
These privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated by CNET Networks, its partner or affiliate.

==========
What personally identifiable information does CNET Networks collect?
CNET Networks' primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services.
Because CNET Networks derives its revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users.
CNET Networks collects personally identifiable information when you provide it to us, such as when you register on one of our sites, when you subscribe for a print magazine or an e-mail newsletter, when you use certain products or services, such as our CatchUp software, and when you visit CNET Networks pages and read newsletters.
==========
Several of the services that we offer on our sites, such as auctions and message boards, may require registration as a condition of use.
Once you register with one of our CNET Networks sites you are no longer anonymous to us.
CNET Networks may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.

What anonymous information does CNET Networks collect?
Cookies
Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites.
However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information.
You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most CNET Networks sites, although active participation in certain areas of our sites may require cookies.
In addition, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain options on your browser.
Web bugs & servers
We use electronic images known as Web bugs--sometimes called single-pixel GIFs, transparent GIFs, or clear gifs--that allow us to track general user traffic patterns.
CNET Networks also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested.
We use tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:
keeping count of return visits to our site or our advertiser' or partners' sites
accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on Web site and advertisement usage
determining which features users like best
saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites
Third-party advertisement servers
Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements on our sites and, in some cases, in our HTML-formatted newsletters.
Often, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and Web bug technologies to measure advertisement effectiveness.
==========
We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship.
Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.
If you would like more information about the privacy policies of the third-party advertising providers including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, check: http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.

How does CNET Networks use the information?
CNET Networks uses the information we gather for four general purposes:
to customize the advertising and content you see
to enhance the user experience in our network of sites.
We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages.
==========
This helps us continue to build a better service for you
to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling users to participate in polls, contests, message boards, and auctions
to send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you
