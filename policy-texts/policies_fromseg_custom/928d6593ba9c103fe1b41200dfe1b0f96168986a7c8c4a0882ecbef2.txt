SolarWinds respects the privacy of all visitors of its websites and users of its products.
This Cookie Policy is incorporated into the SolarWinds Privacy Statement, and it outlines SolarWinds policy concerning use of the cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies (“Cookies”).
SolarWinds may update its Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in technology, legislation, or our data use policies, which may impact the way in which Cookies are used by us and how you as a user can manage them.
SolarWinds may use Cookies to automatically collect certain information when you visit our website, interact with our emails, within the SolarWinds products, or in online advertisements.
A Cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, web beacon, or similar technology is usually a small piece of data sent from the website and stored in a user's web browser while a user is browsing the website.
==========
Cookies were designed to be a mechanism for websites to remember the state of the website or activity the user had taken in the past.
This can include automatically collecting information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, software version, your location, internet service provider, referrer ID and the domain from which you accessed the website, or collection of information about your use of the website, such as the time you spend using the website, date/time stamp, the number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward links, emails, and ads, and other website or product usage data.
When the user browses the website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the user's previous activity.
Information collected by Cookies may be tagged to your information, including your contact information, device information, or other information that you may have provided to SolarWinds.
Other kinds of Cookies include authentication Cookies, which are the most common method used by web servers to recognise whether the user is logged in and the account s/he is logged in under.
Without such a mechanism, the website would not know whether it is authorized to send a page containing sensitive information or whether it should require a user to authenticate himself/herself by logging-in.
==========
SolarWinds uses Cookies that are hosted internally and that are provided by service providers to analyze users’ usage of its website.
Some of these Cookies will be deleted from your device after you leave the Website (a Session Cookie), and others will persist on your device after you leave the Website (a Persistent Cookie).
