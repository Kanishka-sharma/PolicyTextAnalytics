Beta Tests
In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release for the purpose of identifying program errors.
You will be asked to provide to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).
==========
This process is known as a "Beta Test."
You must sign and return to EA a Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement ("Confidentiality Agreement") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("Tester") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to you.
Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the following terms and conditions.
In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.
You understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.
You agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, (ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.
You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-release materials to any other person.
==========
You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations.
Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.
Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you.
==========
As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of evaluating the games and identifying errors.
Nothing in these guidelines, or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.
The beta games are provided for testing on an "as is" and "as available" basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.
When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.
==========
This data may be reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the particular game completes a testing phase.
In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.
By selecting a "Play" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above and not disclose such information to any other person.
Beta Test accounts are non-transferable under any circumstances.
