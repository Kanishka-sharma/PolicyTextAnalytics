irishtimes.com uses small pieces of data called cookies to help customise your user experience.

What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data sent by a website's server to your computer or mobile device and stored in your browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari).
==========
It consists of anonymous information, including a unique user identifier.
When you revisit a site or navigate between pages, this data is passed from your browser to the site's server.
With this data, the website is able to 'remember' your browser, enabling it to retrieve your user preferences, to personalise your visits and to simplify any sign-in procedures.
Cookies are intended to improve your user experience by making it easier and faster to navigate through a website.
==========
For example, some websites require that you log in to gain access.
If such sites did not use cookies, then you would be required to enter your login details every time you navigated to a new page because the website would not be able to remember that you had already logged in.
Many websites also use cookies for advertising purposes.
==========
For example, certain cookies allow a website to determine if you've already seen a particular ad and therefore it may not display that ad on subsequent pages that you visit.
All of the information a cookie collects can only be retrieved by the website server that sent the cookie to your browser.

These cookies are used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

Some of the cookies set on our website are served by third parties and not directly related to The Irish Times or our partners.
For example, occasionally you will find a page on irishtimes.com that includes a video embedded from YouTube.
Service providers such as YouTube set their own cookies on your web browser.
We do not control which cookies are set by third parties or how the cookie information is used - a cookie can only be accessed by the party who set it.
