Valfria och framtida tjänster
Det finns flera alternativa tjänster som du kan välja att abonnera på.
Vilka uppgifter som krävs varierar mellan de olika tjänsterna som erbjuds.
Det här avsnittet beskriver vilka uppgifter som vi samlar in för respektive tjänst och hur vi använder dem.
Användningen av sådana uppgifter är ett tillskott till den användning av personuppgifter som beskrivs i avsnitt 7 och 8 i den här integritetspolicyn.
Registrering
Du kan bli ombedd att fylla i dina personuppgifter i ett registreringsformulär och/eller att välja ett användarnamn och lösenord för att kunna använda vissa funktioner som webbplatsen erbjuder.

Pristävlingar
Emellanåt arrangerar vi pristävlingar på webbplatsen och dessa kan kräva att du registrerar dig.
Uppgifterna som du överför till oss kan användas till att informera dig om att du har vunnit, att bekräfta att ett pris har levererats eller till andra ändamål i samband med en pristävling.
Ibland kan vi komma att publicera vissa av dina personuppgifter på webbplatsen (mottagandet av ett pris kan t.ex.
[i den mån detta är tillåtet enligt lag] komma att kräva att du låter oss publicera en del av dina personuppgifter på webbplatsen, t.ex.
på en vinnarsida).
Vi kommer emellertid aldrig att publicera dina personuppgifter på webbplatsen utan uttryckligt tillstånd från dig.
Ibland förekommer det att en tredje part driver eller leder en pristävling på webbplatsen och samlar in dina personuppgifter.
Vi driver eller leder inte pristävlingen eller lotteriet i sådana fall och har därmed ingen kontroll över vilka uppgifter som samlas in.
Därför är det viktigt att du läser integritetspolicyn för den tredje parten innan du deltar.
Enkäter eller omröstningar
Emellanåt kan vi begära att få uppgifter från dig via enkäter eller omröstningar som görs tillgängliga på eller via webbplatsen.
Deltagande är frivilligt men kan innebära att dina personuppgifter offentliggörs.
Varje enkät eller omröstning innehåller en förklaring om hur sådana uppgifter används.
Uppgifter om transaktioner
Vi kan komma att erbjuda produkter till försäljning eller abonnemang på tjänster.
Om du beställer information från vår webbplats, köper våra produkter eller abonnerar på tjänster som erbjuds på vår webbplats kommer vi att be dig att fylla i en beställningsblankett som begär vissa uppgifter från dig, t.ex.
ekonomisk information om nummer och sista giltighetsdatum för kreditkort, kontakt-, fakturerings- och fraktinformation.
Vi kommer att använda denna information till att genomföra den transaktion som du har begärt, t.ex.
för att leverera information, produkter eller tjänster som du beställer, och för att fakturera dig, samt begränsa antalet biljetter som kan köpas per evenemang för att förhindra kreditkortsbedrägeri.
Du kan också få möjlighet att låta oss behålla dessa uppgifter i en personlig profil för dig så att du slipper skriva in den varje gång du gör ett köp.
För at skydda dig samlas sådan information in och sparas med hjälp av kryptering.
Vi vidarebefordrar endast finansiella uppgifter till tjänsteleverantörer om detta krävs för att kunna handlägga din beställning.
Fantasy-spel
Vi kan komma att erbjuda fantasy-spel via webbplatsen.
Om du registrerar dig för att spela sådana fantasy-spel kan du bli ombedd att tillhandahålla personuppgifter.
Varje spel innehåller en beskrivning av hur sådana uppgifter används.
Chattrum, diskussionsforum och andra mötesplatser
Vi kan komma att ge våra användare tillgång till chattrum, diskussionsforum och andra mötesplatser.
Du behöver inte ange några personuppgifter när du använder sådana forum, med du kan välja att göra det själv.
Om du publicerar personuppgifter på internet blir de offentliga och du kan komma att få oönskade meddelanden från andra parter.
AXS kan inte garantera säkerheten för uppgifter som du väljer att offentliggöra i ett diskussionsforum.
Vi kan inte heller garantera att parter med tillgång till sådana offentligt tillgängliga uppgifter kommer att respektera din integritet.
Var därför försiktig innan du beslutar dig för att offentliggöra personuppgifter inom det här området.
Sociala nätverk
Du kan bli ombedd av oss att dela med dig av uppgifter som finns sparade på sociala nätverk och andra tjänster som drivs av tredje part så att vi kan personanpassa dina upplevelser på webbplatsen.
Du kan välja att inte dela med dig av sådana uppgifter.
Vår webbplats har funktioner för sociala media, t.ex.
==========
en Gilla-knapp för Facebook och olika widgets, bland annat en Dela-knapp och interaktiva miniprogram som används till att driva webbplatsen.
Sådana funktioner kan samla in uppgifter om din IP-adress och vilken sida du besöker på vår webbplats samt spara en kaka för att aktivera funktionerna på rätt sätt.
Din interaktion med sådana funktioner styrs av integritetspolicyn för företaget som tillhandahåller dem.
Du kan logga in på vår webbplats med hjälp av inloggningstjänster som Facebook Connect, som bekräftar din identitet och ger dig möjlighet att förse oss med vissa personuppgifter, bl.a.
ditt namn och din e-postadress.
"Skicka till en vän"-meddelanden
Webbplatsen kan ge dig möjlighet att skicka information på webbplatsen via e-post, sociala nätverk, eller andra meddelandesystem, till mottagare som du anser kan vara intresserade av att få sådan information.
För att kunna använda den här funktionen måste du förse oss med viss information om mottagaren och när du gör det så bekräftar du samtidigt att du har mottagarens tillstånd att göra detta.
Alla personuppgifter som du förmedlar när du skickar meddelandet till mottagaren, t.ex.
ditt namn och din e-postadress, kommer naturligtvis att vidarebefordras till mottagaren.
Vi kan av tekniska skäl behöva behålla mottagarens information i vårt system för leverans och loggning, men vi vidarebefordrar inte informationen till tredje part och använder den endast till att skicka detta enda meddelande och inte till något annat ändamål (såvida inte mottagaren redan har samtyckt till att hans/hennes personuppgifter används till annat ändamål).
Mottagarna av dessa meddelanden förbinder sig inte att ta emot framtida meddelanden från AXS och/eller AEG Group och/eller biljettleverantörer, såvida de inte tidigare har lämnat sitt samtycke genom att använda den här webbplatsen, i enlighet med deras önskemål avseende integritet och avsägande av sådana meddelanden.

• Vi kan komma att skicka erbjudanden till dig från AXS, dess filialer och våra kampanjpartners med utgångspunkt från uppgifterna som du förmedlat till oss.
Om du inte har avsagt dig sådana meddelanden när du köper en biljett för ett specifikt evenemang på vår webbplats kan dina personuppgifter komma att vidarebefordras till den person eller organisation som levererar biljetterna till AXS och som vi säljer biljetter för.
Sådana personer eller organisationer kan, utan begränsning, vara arenor, arrangörer, producenter, artister, team eller skivbolag ("Biljettleverantören").
Det kan finnas mer  än en biljettleverantör per evenemang och för evenemang vid Stockholm Globe Arenas anses både evenemangets arrangör och Stockholm Globe Arenas AB vara biljettleverantör.
Vi kan också komma att vidarebefordra dina personuppgifter till följande parter:
• våra anställda och ombud för administration av ditt konto och de produkter och tjänster som vi erbjuder dig nu eller i framtiden; eller
• polis, myndigheter, juridiska rådgivare eller parter vars begäran vi skäligen kan bedöma vara legitim i samband med en påstådd lagöverträdelse, ett misstänkt brott mot AXS användarvillkor eller annat missbruk våra tjänster från din sida.
En del av de organisationer som vi kan komma att röja dina personuppgifter för befinner sig utanför det Europeiska ekonomiska samarbetsområdet (EES).
En del av dessa länder saknar lagar som skyddar din integritet i lika stor utsträckning som i Storbritannien.
Om vi överför dina personuppgifter till andra territorier kommer vi dock att vidta lämpliga åtgärder som säkerställer att de skyddas på lämpligt sätt och endast behandlas i enlighet med denna integritetspolicy.
När du samtycker till denna integritetspolicy samtycker du också till sådan överföring.
Om vi mot all förmodan skulle komma att sälja eller på annat sätt avyttra hela, eller delar av, vår verksamhet förbehåller vi oss rätten att överföra dina personuppgifter som en del av de tillgångar som säljs eller avyttras.
Om du tidigare har samtyckt till att låta oss vidarebefordra dina uppgifter till tredje parter eller utomlands och vill att detta ska upphöra kan du skicka en skriftlig begäran till "Compliance Officer", AXS Digital Europe Sweden AB, Box 10055, 121 27 Stockholm-Globen".
Din begäran måste innehålla ditt namn och din e-post- och postadress.
En skriftlig begäran som sänds via ytpost måste också undertecknas.
Det tar oss normalt sju arbetsdagar för oss att behandla din begäran.
