Overview
Personal information refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.
How we handle your personal information will depend on whether we act as a "controller" or as a "processor" of the personal information.
The controller is the entity that decides how and why to process personal information.
The processor processes personal information on behalf of the controller at the controller's direction.
Teachable's Role as a Controller of Your Personal Information.
Teachable is the controller of personal information that it collects and processes in connection with the use of our marketing site and the provision of Teachable Services.
This includes personal information that you provide to us when you create an account on the Platform, subscribe to a Teachable plan, enroll in a course, purchase Coaching through our Platform, etc.
==========
Please refer to the "Personal Information We Collect" section of this Privacy Policy for more information about personal information that Teachable collects as a controller.
Teachable's Role as a Processor of Personal Information Collected by Creators.
Creators are the owners of content that they upload, submit, or otherwise provide to the Platform ("Creator Content") and are the controller with respect to any personal information included in their Creator Content.
==========
Teachable acts as a processor when it processes Creator Content on behalf of the Creator.
When a Student enrolls in Creator Content, Teachable will provide the Creator access to a limited set of personal information about the Student ("Student Data") to enable the Creator to provide their services to the Student.
Teachable and Creators may each use Student Data for their own business purposes, at all times subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Data Processing Agreement and our Terms of Use.
The Creator and Teachable each act as an independent controller with respect to their particular use of Student Data.
Creators acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the protection of personal information for which they are controllers.

If you are a Student whose personal information has been collected by a Creator, please contact the Creator directly and view the Creator's privacy policy if you have questions about how the Creator uses your personal information.
