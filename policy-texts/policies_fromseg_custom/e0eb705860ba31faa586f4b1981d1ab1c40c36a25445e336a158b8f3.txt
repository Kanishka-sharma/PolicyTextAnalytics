Square Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 08/01/2012
This Privacy Policy describes the information Square collects about you, how we use and share that information, and the privacy choices we offer.
This policy applies to information we collect when you sign up for Square; access or use our website, mobile applications, products, and services (collectively, the "Services"); or when you otherwise interact with us.
To be clear, this policy applies to information we collect if you make a payment through Square’s Services—even if you have not signed up for a Square account or downloaded one of our applications.
This Privacy Policy does not, however, describe the practices of other Square users, including merchants, that may collect information from you when you interact with them through the Services, and we encourage you to ask them about their privacy practices before providing any information to them.
==========
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If we make changes, we will notify you by posting the updated policy and revising the "Last Updated" date above.
We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use our Services to stay informed about our information practices and about ways you can help protect your privacy.
