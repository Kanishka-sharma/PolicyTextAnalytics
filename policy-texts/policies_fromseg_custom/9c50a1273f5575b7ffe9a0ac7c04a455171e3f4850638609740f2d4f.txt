During your visit, FARES.NET does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information from you, such as your Internet service provider, your browser type, and your operating system.
We may collect and aggregate this data from time to time in order to present such information to prospective advertisers that are interested in our users' habits (e.g., 65 percent of our users connect at a modem speed faster than 28,800 kbps).
