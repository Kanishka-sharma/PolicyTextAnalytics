We are updating our Privacy Policy and Terms
There are new changes in global privacy law that required us to review our standards and because we want to provide clearer, more precise, plain language about how we collect, use, and share Personal Data, we are updating our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).
Here are the key things to note as you review our policies:

Privacy - Our commitment to privacy has not changed.
The Privacy Policy has been reorganized to make it easier to read and to address new global requirements.
The policy outlines how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal data.
==========
We have also expanded the Country/Region-Specific Disclosures.
Transparency & Choice - You control what, how, and when you share your personal data with Under Armour.
==========
We want you to easily understand your rights and our obligations to you.
So, we’ve tried to use plain language throughout the Terms and Privacy Policy.
==========
We believe you should be able to control the use of your personal data - and know that you can ask us to stop.
Over the next few months, we will be rolling out a series of changes to how you interact with the privacy tools within our Fitness and Wellness websites and apps.
==========
This will allow you to more easily exercise choice; including how you provide your consent for certain use, collection, and sharing of personal data.
Terms - To streamline the terms and make them easier to understand, we moved some content related to user privacy and personal data into our Privacy Policy.
We also added language around the importance of user responsibility and best judgment related to your use of any dietary or fitness oriented information offered by Under Armour.
==========
These changes will go into effect on May 20, 2018.
For more information, we encourage you to read the full text of the Privacy Policy and the Terms.
If you have any questions, please contact us via our support portal.
