More than 5,000 businesses have turned to TRUSTe to help navigate the thorny issue of online privacy, from the Monster.com job site to the Path social network.
Behind the scenes, the San Francisco's company helps websites and mobile apps establish privacy policies and ensures they're following all the relevant laws and industry standards.
Those that comply earn a privacy seal that may make consumers more willing to check out the site or download the app.
Consumers, after all, are becoming ever more wary about how much personal information they're revealing online.
==========
In a recent UC Berkeley survey, 60 percent of respondents said they are in favor of regulations to prevent websites and advertisers from collecting data about them.
The survey was in response to the Federal Trade Commission's efforts to create a universal "do not track" policy, establishing a standard for businesses and advertisers on how they collect data about online users.
In a recent interview, TRUSTe CEO Chris Babel discussed just how much information an online business - and, in the future, a neighborhood retailer or shopping center - could gather about its customers.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: How much does the average operator of a website know about consumers?
A: Let me take a different tack: What could I do to piece together (data) to market to you?
I could drop a cookie on your machine.
I could work through one of the advertising exchanges and know what sites you have been on, and what you might be interested in, (such as) shoes or electronics.
I could tie that to a cookie I've dropped on your mobile device.
==========
I could work with someone where you have given your e-mail address.
Once I have your e-mail address, I could go to an offline marketer and buy your home address, ZIP code, phone number - all of those things.
I can take all that, and now I have a sense of how much you make, based on your neighborhood zip code.
Depending on the app on your mobile device, there's a chance that I could know exactly where your office is and where your home is.
==========
I could find out who your spouse is.
That's the dossier I could put together on you.
We (TRUSTe) don't do any of that.
We help companies that may be looking to do targeting, to think about the lines that can and can't be crossed.
We help companies think through how to collect that information, if they can share it or can't share it, if they have the right consumer consent.
We're almost like middlemen.
We tell consumers about what's happening and protect consumers from bad things happening.
We work with companies to think through best practices.
We try to marry those together to help build trust.
Q: What can consumers do to protect themselves?
==========
A: With advertising, clicking on us (TRUSTe's advertising option icon) opts you out of seeing the ads.
It doesn't opt you out of being tracked.
(A do-not-track proposal) is still being decided, as to whether it opts you out of targeting or just receiving the ads.
Firefox started and implemented a do-not-track feature about a year ago in the browser.
==========
Other browsers have said they will adopt it but haven't put it in yet.
There are still a lot of people who don't know about do not track, because they haven't seen it in their browser and haven't heard about it.
We're still at a point where knowledge is low.
Thinking about your social networking settings is also very important.
==========
On the mobile side, it's what apps you download.
The scarier thing about mobile is two things: The app you download can access a lot of things, (such as) your contacts and your calendar.
The second is it can access your location at any time.
It requires being diligent and thinking about it.
That puts the onus on consumers.
Q: TRUSTe used to be a nonprofit, but transitioned into a for-profit business in 2008.
Why?
A: It came down to the fact that privacy issues were exploding, in terms of the complexity of all this consumer data collection.
As a nonprofit, the mission was to play this trusted intermediary between consumers and businesses.
==========
(But) with all these issues growing so quickly, it wasn't going to be able to meet its mission.
It needed to be able to lose money and invest in an engineering team to build products that could meet market demand.
As a for-profit, we invest in the future.
Q: Are you still losing money?
==========
A: We will be hitting break-even toward the end of next year, which is in alignment with our plans.
Q: What other privacy issues should we be aware of?
A: Ten years ago, it was, "Do I give out my credit card and address?"
That transitioned into advertising targeting and tracking, and that's all transitioning to mobile.
==========
This continues to grow to other areas.
Malls and brick-and-mortar stores are starting to test new technology.
For instance, can I give free Wi-Fi access in the mall so that when you connect your iPhone, I know where you are in the mall.
I might know where you've shopped, and I might know what you're interested in and how much time you spent looking at that pair of shoes.
How can I use that to market to you?
==========
Companies have CCTV (closed-circuit television) that they use for theft prevention, historically.
But can they use that to do some sort of facial recognition to know the gender makeup of their customers?
Can they use that over time to potentially identify by individual?
All the types of targeting and tracking you see happening online are starting to make their way back to brick-and-mortar retail.
People focus on the digital aspect of this, but it's all going to come back full circle to the real world.
==========
We're in the age of big data, where it's easy to store things.
We're not certain of (all the) use cases, but a lot of use cases will be thought of in the next decade.
How does that impact consumer privacy?
It's going to cause a lot of interesting questions.
