  and topics of interest.

Cookies:
To better serve our visitors, we use technology to track new and returning visitors actions while on the website.
These small files are commonly referred to as "cookies."
Our cookies don't not contain any personally-identifiable information.
Our web measurement applications compare the behavior of new and returning visitors in the aggregate to help us identify work flows and trends and also resolve common problems on our site.
Cookies are 
  small files that Web servers place on a user's hard drive.
They can 
  serve several functions: 

 they allow 
    the Web site to identify you as a previous visitor each time you access a
    site; 
 they track 
    what information you view at a site (important to the Department of Commerce to ensure visitors find what they are looking for); 
 in the more 
    advanced cases they track your movements through many Web sites but not 
    the whole Web; 
 businesses 
    use them for customer convenience to allow them to produce a list of 
    items to buy and pay for them all at one time and to garner information 
    about what individuals are buying at their sites; 
 advertisers 
    use them to determine the effectiveness of their marketing and offer 
    insights into consumer preferences and tastes by collecting data from 
    many Web sites; and 
 they can be 
    used to help a Web site tailor screens for each customer's preference.
==========
We will retain data the technology makes available only as long as required by law, or specific program need as specified by the National Archives and Records Administration’s General Records Schedule 20, which pertains to Electronic Records or other approved records schedule as applicable.
If 
  you are concerned about the potential use of the information gathered 
  from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you 
  before it accepts a cookie.

  Information via Forms: Some of our sites provide forms 
  allowing visitors to submit search engine queries, questionnaires, 
  feedback, or other information.
Some of these forms may request 
  personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, e-mail 
  address) for specific purposes, such as when the submitter is requesting
  a personal response, registering for a conference, or subscribing to a 
  mailing list.

  non-personally identifiable information we collect (such as search 
  engine queries and anonymous survey responses) indefinitely to help us 
  better understand and meet the needs of our visitors.

  non-personally identifiable information with others, including the 
  public, in aggregated form (for instance, in a list of our most popular 
  search engine queries), in partial or edited form (such as in a report 
  summarizing responses to a questionnaire), or verbatim (for example, in a
  complete listing of survey responses).

  collecting personally identifiable information, we will prominently 
  disclose: 

 why we are 
    requesting the information;

  information.
In these cases, we may retain the information as long as 
  necessary to respond to your request or otherwise resolve the subject 
  matter of your e-mail.

  secure from interception or misdirection.
