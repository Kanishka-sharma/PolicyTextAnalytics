Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
– If required for investigating the illegal use of personal data or for legal proceedings, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if appropriate, to injured third parties.
==========
We will only do this if there are concrete indications of illegal and/or abusive behavior.
We can only transfer on your personal data if this is used to enforce General Terms
Right of Restriction of Processing
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
If required for investigating the illegal use of personal data or for legal proceedings, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if appropriate, to injured third parties.
We will only do this if there are concrete indications of illegal and/or abusive behavior.
==========
We can only transfer on your personal data if this is used to enforce General Terms.
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the AAX, LLC , he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller.
The employee of the AAX, LLC will arrange the restriction of the processing.

Right to Withdraw Data Protection Consent

If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the AAX, LLC.

Legal Basis for the Processing
Art. 6(1) lit.
a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.
b GDPR.
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.
Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit.
c GDPR.
==========
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.
==========
Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit.
d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.
f GDPR.
This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.
==========
He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
The Legitimate Interests Pursued by the Controller or by a Third Party
Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.
f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.
==========
Period for Which the Personal Data will be Stored
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
==========
Provision of Personal Data as Statutory or contractual Requirement; Requirement Necessary to Enter into a Contract; Obligation of the Data Subject to Provide the Personal Data; Possible Consequences of Failure to Provide Such Data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.
The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.
==========
The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.
The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
==========
Security and Data Integrity
Safeguarding the information you give us or we receive about you is a priority for AAX LLC.
We take appropriate security measures to protect it against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
AAX LLC has taken steps to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems and services processing personal data, and will restore the availability and access to data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
