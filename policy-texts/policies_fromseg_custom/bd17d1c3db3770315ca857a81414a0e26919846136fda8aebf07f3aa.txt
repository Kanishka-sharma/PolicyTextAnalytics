Giving Assistant's mission is to turn your everyday shopping into charitable actions.
Giving Assistant is a free, ecommerce loyalty program that makes it easy to save money and support charity when shopping at over 1,600 of the most popular brands and e-retailers, including Amazon, Target & Walmart.
==========
Only your email address and password are required to sign up and start saving.
Giving Assistant does not require you to install software on your computer, and we do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
==========
Members can earn cash back on purchases simply by using the website GivingAssistant.org.
Brands pay a commission to Giving Assistant for being sent paying customers, which we in turn pass back to our shoppers, in the form of cash back.
Typically the commission is a percentage of the sale, and varies by retailer.
Instead of keeping some or all of that money, like most sites, we give it ALL to you.
==========
Shoppers are able to automatically donate any percentage of their cash back to a charity of their choice.
Plus, as part of its One-for-One program, Giving Assistant will donate a meal to a needy family every time one its members earns cash back.
How Do I Receive Cash Back?
==========
We offer our members two convenient payment methods:
PayPal
Check
Both methods are fee-free with a minimum payout of $5.01.
You can change your preferred payment method by going to your account page and clicking on ‘Settings’ in the top right corner.
==========
To receive payment of accrued Cash Back and any other rewards, you must create and maintain an account with Giving Assistant using an accurate and up-to-date information including: a valid email address at which you are able to receive email, a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail, your first and last name, and a password to protect your account.
If Giving Assistant suspects fraudulent activity is associated with your account, we reserve the right to delay or withhold payment indefinitely.
Giving Assistant is not responsible for payments delivered to the wrong address through no fault of Giving Assistant or for errors made payment partners like PayPal.
If checks are returned or expired, Giving Assistant will attempt to reach you using the contact information in your account and will reissue payment if requested.
After three years, if you have not claimed or deposited your cash back payment, Giving Assistant reserves the right to reabsorb these earnings.
For information on payment schedules and other Cash Back topics, please see our FAQs.
==========
Tax Deductible Donations:
Giving Assistant acts as our users' agent for the purpose of making charitable donations.
You maintain complete control over which charitable organization receives your money, as well as how much of your cashback to donate.
Giving Assistant sends checks to non-profit organizations only once they've reached a minimum of $25 in donations from our users collectively.
==========
Due to this policy, your donation may occur a significant length of time after you've earned cash back.
Giving Assistant will notify you when the transfer has occurred and only then will you be able to claim your deduction.
==========
If the $25 threshold is not reached after 12 months, Giving Assistant will return the funds to your account upon request.
Charities will provide substantiation for certain donations made to them.
In certain cases, these substantiation documents will be required in order to claim the associated tax deduction.
In order for your chosen charity to substantiate your tax deductible contribution, Giving Assistant must provide them with some basic personal information, including your name and email address.
==========
A copy of our Privacy Policy is available on our website should you have any additional questions regarding use of your personal information.
