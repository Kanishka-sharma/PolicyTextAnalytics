Message Data
When you send or receive messages using the Snapchat services, we
	temporarily process and store your images and videos in order to
	provide our services.
Although we attempt to delete image data as soon
	as possible after the message is received and opened by the recipient
	(and after a certain period of time if they don't open the message), we
	cannot guarantee that the message contents will be deleted in every
	case.
For example, users may take a picture of the message contents
	with another imaging device or capture a screenshot of the message
	contents on the device screen.
Consequently, we are not able to
	guarantee that your messaging data will be deleted in all instances.
==========
Messages, therefore, are sent at the risk of the user.
We also log
	information about messages, including time, date, and who sent and
	received the message.
