What does this privacy policy cover?
TripleLift values your privacy.
We intend for this document to clearly detail the principles of our technology solutions and the data we collect through our technologies and through our website.
This privacy policy currently covers cookies belonging to the adpinr.com domain as well as triplelift.com.
What does TripleLift know about me?
TripleLift works with retailers and publishers.
==========
Our aim is to deliver more engaging, interactive content.
The adpinr.com domain does not deliver cookies with an advertisement.
The 3lift.
com domain does deliver cookies - but all we use are anonymous IDs.
==========
We do not know who you are.
We don’t even have room in our database to store who you are.
This means we don’t know your name, your profession, your IQ, your cat’s name, who you crushed on in 6th grade or anything like that.
We don’t even know if you’ve seen one of our ads.
==========
If you buy something from a site we work with, we do not and cannot tie back the information from the purchase (your name, your address, your credit card information) to you – we never and cannot get the purchase information.
That stays with the advertiser or publisher.
What are cookies?
Cookies are actually text files that live on the user’s computer.
Each browser has its own set of cookies, and uses them for record-keeping.
We use cookies on our triplelift.com website, but these do not get intermingled with anything else.
So anything that may be personally identifiable to you from this website (ie if you submit an inquiry and provide your name and email) will not be tied back to you from an advertising perspective.
You can remove all of our cookies by following the directions in your browser.

Third Party Cookies
Third-party cookies are not covered by this privacy statement.
We do not have any control over the policies of third parties, but we do not intermingle our data with theirs.
From time to time, TripleLift may engage third-party services to conduct independent verification studies.
These third-parties are bound by their own privacy policies, including Vizu
