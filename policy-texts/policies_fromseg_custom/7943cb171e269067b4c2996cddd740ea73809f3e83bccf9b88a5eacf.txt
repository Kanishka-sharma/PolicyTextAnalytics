Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

Basis of the Bargain.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WIKIA HAS OFFERED THE SERVICES, USER CONTENT, MATERIALS AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND WIKIA, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND WIKIA.

If you are a Subscribing Organization, then you are not granted any rights under this section.
d. Applicable Law and Venue
If you are a Subscribing Organization, then the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH WIKIA AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WIKIA.
You and Wikia agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Services, except that you and Wikia are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
==========
You and Wikia agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.
Notice to Wikia shall be sent to Wikia, Inc., Attn: Legal Dept, 130 Sutter Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104.
You and Wikia further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.
Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Wikia will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.
==========
If you are a consumer resident of the European Union, then the following applies:
Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will be governed by and construed under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence.
Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence.

Wikia may transfer some or all of its rights and obligations under these Terms of Service to another organisation in the event that Wikia, or some or all assets related to the Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event (referred to herein as a “Transfer Event”).
If Wikia intends to transfer some or all of its rights and obligations under these Terms of Service in connection with a Transfer Event, Wikia will take all steps required by applicable law, which may include seeking your consent or providing you with fair and reasonable advance notice of the transfer and an opportunity to opt out by contacting us before the transfer takes place.
If you opt out or deny consent, we may terminate your contract, close your account, and provide a pro rata refund to you for any payments you have made for impacted subscription services not yet provided.
