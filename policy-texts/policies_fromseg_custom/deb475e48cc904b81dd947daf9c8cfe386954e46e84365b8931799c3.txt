Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)
When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information.
This address is called the computer's "IP address."
For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.
Globe Companies may use the user's IP Address to:
facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or Globe Company's technical team.
display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area.
==========
estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations.
Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities.
Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.
==========
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to the user's web browser from a web site's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.
==========
Globe Companies may use cookies to:
improve the operation and performance of the Globe Companies Services and to make Globe Companies Services easier and more convenient to use.
For example, cookies help Globe Companies provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference).
Cookies also allow Globe Companies to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a Globe Companies Site;
measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to Globe Companies Services and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics).
This information helps Globe Companies to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides Globe Companies with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content.
This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Globe Companies' current and prospectiv
