==========
HOW MASSLIVE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:  This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.
A user's personally identifiable information may be used by MassLive and its affiliates for editorial purposes.
MassLive may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes.
We may share your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it conducts business.
For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services to you.
In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information to them.
We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs.
While MassLive will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, MassLive does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.
Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.
==========
If you have any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information on any part of MassLive, please e-mail us at webmaster@masslive.com, before submitting any information.
We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes.
For example, we might report to our advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.
Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
COOKIES: MassLive may place a "cookie" in the browser files of MassLive user's computer.
The cookie may contain personally identifiable information.
Cookies enable MassLive to serve information that you have requested, or that relate to your use of  MassLive to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to MassLive.
You also may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.
MassLive does not control these cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy.
The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet industry.

PARENTS:  We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating.
Any personally identifiable information collected by MassLive from children (that we are aware are children) will be used only for MassLive internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment and for fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database.
However, such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior consent.
