Other Tracking Technologies on our Website

Our third party analytics partner may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing 
us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web 
users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period 
 at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
==========
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, 
browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does 
not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our 
user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
==========
We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what 
you view on our site to personalize your visit.
Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon 
your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type 
of, and how data is stored.
Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
