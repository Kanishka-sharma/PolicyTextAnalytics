COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
The doubleclick.com website uses cookies.
A “cookie” is a small text file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters.
There are two types of cookies that may be used at the doubleclick.com website: a persistent cookie and a session cookie.
A persistent cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the “Cookies” folder on your computer and remains in this “Cookies” folder after you close your browser.
==========
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.
A session cookie is held temporarily in your computer’s memory and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer.
==========
The doubleclick.com website may also use Web beacons (also called “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) in conjunction with cookies.
Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page.
If you have arrived at this website by clicking on a banner ad for one of our products or services, a session cookie may be used.
This cookie will contain an identification number for the ad that you clicked on, or will contain an identification number for the site that you were visiting when you clicked on the banner ad.
This session cookie helps DoubleClick’s Marketing Department determine which of our ads attract the most visitors.
If, after you arrive at our site, you choose to request further information from us about our products and services, the personal information that you provide in that request will be linked to the information in the session cookie.
This also helps DoubleClick’s Marketing Department measure the effectiveness of our advertising.
==========
This “linking” will not be used to target future advertisements to you or to send you emails about future goods and services.
You will receive emails about our products only if you tell us on the product request page that you want us to send them to you.
==========
Because this is a session cookie, it will disappear once you have closed your browser.
If you return to our site via another one of our ads, you will appear as a new visitor unless and until you provide further personal information.
The doubleclick.com website may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information collected in our log files (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring URLs, etc.) about your activity at this site to better understand how the website is used, resolve technical problems, and enhance your experience at this site.
Information from website analysis cookies or about website usage is not combined with information from any other DoubleClick cookie.

We use a third-party email technology to send emails that you have agreed to receive.
Web beacons are used in those email messages to measure the effectiveness of our advertising.

In addition, DoubleClick may serve ads on this and other websites using our own DART ad-serving technology.
In doing so, one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your computer and will use non-personal information about your browser and your activity at this site to serve ads on this and other sites.
The ad-serving cookie is a persistent cookie.
Please click here for more information about DoubleClick ad serving or to opt-out of the DoubleClick ad-serving cookie.
