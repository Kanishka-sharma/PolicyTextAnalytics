We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but they may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device and they may otherwise collect or have access to anonymous Usage Information.
When you opt out of the Service, Madison Logic will no longer use or share any of your Personal or anonymous Usage Information, unless you recently submitted Personal Information (within last 30 days) in order to access free content, in which case only the Content Provider associated with the content you recently acquired will have access to your information.

change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or
set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies

Please note, however, that cookies are used for a variety of reasons, not just marketing-related, so this may adversely impact your online experience.
