	     SurveyMonkey Contribute ("SMC") is used by people who are
	     interested in taking surveys on SMC ("Panelists") and
	     people who conduct the surveys taken by Panelists ("Panel
	     Buyers").
This privacy statement describes privacy
	     practices which are specific to SMC and should be read in
	     conjunction with our
	     main Privacy
	     Policy.
We refer to surveys conducted through SMC as
	     "panel surveys," and these are treated differently to
	     surveys conducted through
	     SurveyMonkey's main
	     website.
This page is split into two sections: one for Panelists, and one for Panel Buyers.
PRIVACY FOR PANELISTS
What information does SurveyMonkey collect from Panelists?
Below is a list of information that we collect from you and
	     about you when you use SMC.
==========
The sections afterward
	     describe what we do with this information.
Information we receive directly from you


Registration information: You are required to have a SurveyMonkey account to use SMC as a Panelist.
To register for a SurveyMonkey account, we need to collect account information from you (your username, password, and email address).
==========
Profile data: To allow Panel Buyers to target Panelists with specific characteristics when conducting panel surveys, we build profiles of Panelists.
We build up your profile by asking you to answer questions about yourself, and from your responses to panel surveys that Panel Buyers conduct.
We refer to all of this information as "profile data."
When compiling profile data, we may collect your demographic information (e.g. year of birth, gender, employment status, the industry in which you work, ethnicity, religion, income level, education level, country of residence, zip code, political views, home ownership status, marital status, number of children, etc.), interests (e.g. what activities you participate in and how often you participate), preferences (e.g. what sort of food or drinks you like) and opinions.
Panel survey responses: We receive your survey responses that you submit to Panel Buyers.
Information we receive about you from other sources


Usage data: We receive usage data about you whenever you interact with SMC.
This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, and which panel surveys you complete.
==========
Device data: We receive data from the device you use to access SMC, such as your IP address and your browser type.
We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
Provision of information is voluntary: You can always choose not to provide any personal information that we ask you for.
However, your ability to use SMC may be limited if you do not give information that we require to provide you with our services.
For example, if you do not provide profile data, you may be unable to participate in surveys or your chances of being chosen for a survey may be reduced.
==========
About sensitive information: We will treat sensitive information (for example, personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information related to one's sexual preferences) with particular care.
If we intend to disclose such information to a third party or use it for a purpose other than as described in this privacy statement, we will obtain your specific permission to do so prior to any such use or disclosure.
How does SurveyMonkey use your information?
Generally, we use your information in connection with providing SMC services to you and to Panel Buyers.
==========
More specifically, we use it:
	   


To provide you with relevant surveys: We use your profile data to target panel surveys to you and send you emails inviting you to take those surveys.
For example, if the profile data you provide shows you are a 30 year old female living in New York, we may send you a survey where a Panel Buyer is interested in the opinions of any person living in New York aged between 25-35 years.
To improve SMC: We internally use the data we receive to improve the quality of our service.
For example, we use and analyze usage data (such as page view data and response rates) to make the surveys we send more relevant to you, to improve the SMC user interface and to maintain a consistent and reliable user experience.
We use profile data to help us to improve the quality of our panel.
==========
To provide Panel Buyers with more targeting criteria: We may use the responses you give to panel surveys to provide other Panel Buyers with more ways to reach the target demographic they want.
However, we do not give your actual survey responses to Panel Buyers other than the buyer actually conducting the survey.
For example, if you disclose in a panel survey that your stock portfolio has 21 stocks, we might allow Panel Buyers to target Panelists based on their stock portfolio size.
If a Panel Buyer wanted to target people with stock portfolios with more than 10 stocks and you responded to the survey, the Panel Buyer would know that you have more than 10 stocks in your portfolio.
But, we would not share with them the more specific information that you have 21 stocks.
To verify compliance: We may inspect your panel survey responses to ensure your compliance with the SMC Terms of Use.
==========
We do not sell your profile data!
While we do provide some of your profile data to Panel Buyers, we do not sell it.
Not to anyone.
==========
Not marketing firms, not researchers, no one.
Who we disclose your information to and what information we share

	     We recognize that because you give us and allow us to use your profile data and other personal information, we are entrusted with safeguarding the privacy of that information.
Your continuing trust is very important to us, so the only time we will disclose or share that information with a third party is where we have:
	   

	     (a)	given you notice (e.g. in this privacy statement);
	     
	     (b)	obtained your consent (e.g. based on your account's opt-in/opt-out settings); or
	     
	     (c)	anonymized the information, so that you cannot reasonably be identified by it.
==========
We disclose your:
	   


Survey responses to Panel Buyers:  We host panel surveys for Panel Buyers, but they are really the primary curator of survey data.
Anything you expressly disclose in your panel surveys will, naturally, be provided to them.
Panel Buyers may have their own privacy policies which apply to surveys that they create using our services.
These policies detail how Panel Buyers handle your information and if one is provided, we encourage you to read it.
Basic demographics to Panel Buyers:  When you respond to a survey, we automatically provide the Panel Buyer with a specific set of information about you that we compile from your profile data for the Panel Buyer.
We refer to this set of information as "basic demographics".
It includes your:
	       
Year of birth
Gender
Employment status (e.g. full-time employed, full-time student, retired, etc.)
Industry in which you work
Ethnicity
Income
Level of education
Country of residence
Zip code
Languages
Political views (e.g. liberal or conservative)
Religion
Home ownership status
Marital status
Number of children living in your household



	       The sharing of your basic demographics happens behind the scenes and is not visible on the survey.
We do not include your name or contact details as part of the basic demographics.
==========
Other demographics to Panel Buyers (indirectly):  Although we do not disclose more than basic demographics to Panel Buyers, because they target their panel surveys to specific demographics, they will be able to infer that you belong to this demographic simply because they will only receive responses from that demographic.
When selecting the characteristics of desired survey respondents, a Panel Buyer may also receive an indication of how many Panelists match the Panel Buyer's particular demographic requirements for a given survey.
Anonymized Panelist statistics for informational purposes: We may disclose aggregated, or otherwise anonymized, statistics about our Panelists.
For example, we may post on our blog or include in our marketing emails interesting statistics like what the average response rate for panel surveys is, or what percentage of Panelists are male.
Are your panel survey responses anonymous?
To Panel Buyers, the answer is maybe.
Of course, if you disclose your name in a panel survey, you won't be anonymous.
==========
But even if you don't, the personal information you do provide may become identifying when combined with other information.
Remember that Panel Buyers are also supplied with your basic demographics.
To help preserve your anonymity, we require a Panel Buyer's targeting criteria to match a certain minimum number of Panelists before we allow the panel survey to be conducted.
To SurveyMonkey, the answer is no.
==========
We link your responses back to your username but never fear, we do not abuse or exploit this.
We do this to provide Panel Buyers with additional targeting criteria (see "How does SurveyMonkey use your information?"
above).
==========
We do not disclose this link to the Panel Buyer.
Your choices and controls
	   


You can always refuse to answer a survey: Your participation in any panel survey is entirely voluntary and you may opt out of responding at any time.
You can update your information: If you want to change your profile data, contact support@surveymonkey.com and we will be happy to help.
You can leave SMC and have your SMC information deleted: If you no longer wish to use SMC, you can request to leave by contacting support[at]surveymonkey.com.
We will respond to your request without undue delay by removing SMC from your SurveyMonkey account and permanently deleting your profile data.
You will stop receiving invitations to take panel surveys.
Any personal information submitted in the past to panel surveys will not be deleted - you will need to contact the Panel Buyers who created those surveys to access that data.
Note that leaving SMC will not delete your main SurveyMonkey account.

Anonymized panel survey information for informational purposes: We may disclose aggregated, or otherwise anonymized, information about panel surveys.
