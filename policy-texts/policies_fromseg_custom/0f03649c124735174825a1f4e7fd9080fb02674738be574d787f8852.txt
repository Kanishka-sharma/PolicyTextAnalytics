Your Privacy
Shopping.com believes that trust is an important component of the service we provide to our customers.
To ensure that we earn and keep that trust, Shopping.com makes every effort to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information.
This Privacy Policy describes the steps we take to make sure that when you use Shopping.com, you can focus on finding great deals in a safe, worry-free environment.

==========
IP Address Logging
Shopping.com logs IP addresses (your unique Internet address) for system administration purposes.
IP addresses are logged to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting so that we can update and improve the services we offer to you.
We do not link IP addresses to any information that could personally identify you.
This means that the path of your Shopping.com session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous.
Cookies
Shopping.com uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users.
A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our site.
You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., saved searches).

The use of certain Shopping.com features requires that you supply personal information like your name and e-mail address.
At your direction, we may use this information to send you our e-mail newsletter.
This information may also be used to contact you when necessary.

Sharing Information
Unless you give explicit permission (e.g., you opt to receive e-mail from partners and third parties), Shopping.com has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information (such as your e-mail address or mailing address), except when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights, safety or property of Shopping.com, our users, or others.
In certain specific areas of some co-branded sites, we advise you that data you provide to us (for example, when subscribing to our e-mail newsletter) may be required to be shared with our co-brand partner.
