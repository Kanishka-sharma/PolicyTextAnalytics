When a Microsoft product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental consent or authorization is required to use the product, the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it.
We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account.
The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages.

==========
Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft.
Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and enables online experiences crossing multiple platforms.
This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
Children can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows 10 PCs, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).
Xbox consoles are devices your child can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment.
When they sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on a console, we assign a unique identifier to their device.
For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system they are using.Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming.
When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected.Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile.
