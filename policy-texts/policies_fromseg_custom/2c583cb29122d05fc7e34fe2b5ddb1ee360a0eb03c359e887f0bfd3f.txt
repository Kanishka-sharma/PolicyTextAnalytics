McAfee SiteAdvisor Terms of Service
The really big picture:
 Our goal is to help you stay safe online by testing everything on the web and reporting our test results on our Web Site and through our software.
We are testing primarily for safety, security, and online nuisances, not for potentially offensive content.
==========
So please don't misconstrue our 'green' safety ratings as an endorsement of a Web site's specific content or general subject matter, or as a general quality rating of the Web site.
We encourage open feedback from our users and the owners of the Web sites we test, and we will post feedback with little screening other than for profanity.
Basically, if you wouldn't say it to your grandmother, please don't post it publicly on our Web Site.
Our safety ratings and recommendations are guidelines based on our documented test results, but not guarantees of what will happen in every situation when you browse a website, download a file, or provide signup information online.

Description of Service
We test websites, downloadable programs, and registration/signup forms using a variety of automated and manual techniques, in order to help Internet users make more informed decisions about where they search, browse, and transact online.
The results of our tests are reported in various summary and detailed formats on the Web Site and via the company's software products.

Our test results are developed primarily by automated machinery and computers.

Portions of our software may display the results of our test results as users search for sites or browse the Internet.

Our software may display our test results adjacent to websites which some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive.
We assume no responsibility for the content of any site we test, listed on the Web Site or referenced by our software.
