==========
CERTIFICATION, LICENSURE, AND ACADEMIC ADMISSION TEST SERVICES
We provide testing services as a service provider to test sponsors.
The test sponsor is the company or organization that offers certification, licensure, or academic admission testing and controls the test(s) that must be taken to secure such certification, licensure, or academic admission.
We collect or receive personal information from certification, licensure, and academic admission testing candidates.
We use this information in order to perform services relating to certification, licensure, and academic admission testing on behalf of the test sponsor.
This includes test registration, collection of payment for testing services requested, and communicating with candidates about certification, licensure, and academic admission testing and the results of such testing.
Providing personal information is voluntary, but necessary if the candidate wishes to receive licensure, certification, or academic admission testing.
We will handle and treat all personal information collected and received by us in connection with certification, licensure, and academic admission test registration and administration in the manner outlined in this Privacy Policy.
SAFE HARBOR AND DATA COLLECTION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES
