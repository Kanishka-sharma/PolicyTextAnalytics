Who are we?
==========
Livewrapped (“Livewrapped”, “our”, “us”, “we”) connects sellers of ad inventory, such as publishers (“clients”) with buyers by utilizing so called “header bidding” technology on our platform (*Platform”).
We are an independent, publisher-focused Platform that help our clients monetize their websites so that they can continue offering users (“you”, “your”) content.
Our Platform acts as a middle man between buyers and you as a user of our clients’ services.
==========
As such, we provide a link between you and the buyer's data about you.
The data that we store about you can only be connected to you by the buyer and not by Livewrapped.
The information is personal data to you and the buyer but not to us.
