ï¿½DISPUTES / ARBITRATION
If a dispute arises between you and us, our preference is to resolve the matter quickly and in the most cost effective manner possible.
ï¿½Before resorting to the methods described below for settling a dispute, we ask that you provide us with notice of the dispute via email to tos.support@flixster-inc.com.
ï¿½Upon receipt, we shall have no less than ten (10) business days to attempt to resolve the dispute with you before the parties resort to the other alternatives described in this Section 22.
ï¿½
Any dispute of any kind between you and any of our Companies arising under these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration in the county in which you reside.ï¿½ Both parties reserve the right to seek an injunction or temporary restraining order from a Federal or State court in the United States.ï¿½ However, after such request for relief has been heard by such court, the remainder of the dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration as otherwise set forth herein.ï¿½ We reserve the right to demand any remedy for violations of these Terms of Service and/or any other rules and regulations set forth on the Services, including without limitation the right to block access from a particular Internet address.
ï¿½
Any arbitrator proceeding over a dispute arising under these Terms of Service shall be a retired judge or justice of any state or federal court with substantial experience in the subject matter relevant to the matter in dispute and shall follow California law in adjudicating the dispute.ï¿½ï¿½The parties agree that an arbitrator proceeding over a dispute should seek, whenever practicable, to resolve threshold legal issues by way of motions filed by the parties.
ï¿½The parties also agree that they will follow the JAMS rules in arbitrating their dispute, except to the extent that the JAMS rules are inconsistent with this Agreement or the class action waiver described below.
==========
If the claim you wish to assert against us is less than $10,000, then, at your election, the arbitration may proceed in-person, by telephone, or by written briefs.
ï¿½At your election, you also may bypass arbitration and proceed to assert your claim in small claims court.
ï¿½If either party files a claim in state or federal court that is required by this Agreement to have been brought to arbitration, then the other party shall be entitled to his/her/its reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in successfullyï¿½filing a motion to compel the claim to arbitration.
22.
==========
ï¿½CLASS ACTION WAIVER
The parties agree that they will resolve their disputes on an individual basis.
ï¿½Any claims brought under this agreement must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding.
ï¿½This agreement also prevents any party from participating in a class action (existing or future) that was brought by any other party.
ï¿½Instead, the parties agree to resolve their disputes under this agreement on an individual basis.

==========
ï¿½SEVERABILITY.
ï¿½
If any provision of these Terms of Service shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable for this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
This is the entire agreementï¿½between the parties relating to the matters contained herein and shall not be changed except by a signed writing by an officer of Flixster.
