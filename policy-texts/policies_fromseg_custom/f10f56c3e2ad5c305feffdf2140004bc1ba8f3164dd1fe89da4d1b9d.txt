Controlling your Personal Information 
One of the great features of CafeMom is that you control who will see your profile information as well as any other information or photos that you post on the Site, simply by adjusting your privacy settings.
==========
When you first create a profile, or when you make any changes to it, you can select who will see that information.
In most cases (there are a few exceptions, described below), you can make your profile information completely private, so that no one sees it but you.
You can also choose to make your profile information (or parts of it) visible only to the friends in your network.
Or you can choose to make it visible to everyone who visits the Site.
==========
You also have control over the personal information you post to the Site through journals, photos and other features.
Each time that you make a post to the Site, you'll be prompted to choose who you want to see that post.
You can choose to share photos and posts with your network of friends, or you can choose to share them with everyone.
You can change your privacy selection for a particular post at any time by editing the original post/photo and changing the privacy setting in the "Privacy" area of the edit page.
However, that change will only affect that particular piece of content.
==========
Be aware that if you choose to make your posts visible to everyone, then any personal information you post will be accessible to all Members and all visitors to the Site.
You should also be aware that any information that is made public on the Site will be searchable by other search engines.
In addition, even if that content is later removed from this Site, it may still be stored in other computers of people who visited the Site, and removal of that information from this Site will not remove it from those other computers.
Therefore, we caution you to be very careful about posting personal information to the Site.
In addition, some information that you add to your profile cannot be hidden and is always visible to anyone who visits that Site.
That includes your avatar, your screen name and your location.
In addition, you will show up in searches on the Site based on your ZIP/Postal code.
If you're uncomfortable disclosing this information, just make something up.
For example, your location can be "none of your beeswax" or "Land of Oz."
==========
The point is, be aware that the information you post will be viewed by many people who you don't know and you should exercise good judgment and discretion when you choose to post personal information.
You can identify yourself by screen name in your posts or can post anonymously.
However, even if you post anonymously, the CafeMom Team will be able to identify your posts.
CafeMom makes every effort to ensure that your Profile Data and posts are displayed only to the people you selected in your privacy settings.
However, mistakes can happen.
==========
If you believe that your content is being displayed in a manner that you did not authorize, you can notify us of the error by using the "Contact Us" button on any page of the Site and we will correct the problem promptly.
However, you agree that your sole remedy against us if we were to make such a mistake is to require us to change the privacy settings to those that you originally requested.
