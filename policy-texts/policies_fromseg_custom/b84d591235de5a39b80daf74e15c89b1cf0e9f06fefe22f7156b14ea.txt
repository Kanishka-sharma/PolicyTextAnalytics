Bottom line: We know that almost no one reads those 10 page TOS guidelines, so we'll make this short and sweet...
You're free to put up anything with a genuine purpose.
(Generally something that your grandmother would accept or like.)
Other than that, you are **PROHIBITED** from putting any content that's related to the following: (Should any of these sites be uploaded, not only will our automated script REMOVE THEM INSTANTLY but our staff 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        will find them the same day and permanently delete your account and ban your I.P. from ever accessing 110mb.
com)

Phishing of any company, especially MySpace, eBay, PayPal and other banks.
Using your domain to spam other sites.
(We use a technology that captures your real I.P. address even if you're faking it with whatever is out there.
We can then easily use this I.P. (and other tracking factors) to have your ISP shut down your internet access permanently.
Hence your details are also revealed, and you will be majorily fined and prosecuted, as we've already done with those that thought they could bypass the check.)
Violence, racial intolerance, or advocate against any individual, group, or organization


Content that promotes illegal activity or infringes on the legal rights of others


 Sales or promotion of beer or hard alcohol, tobacco or drugs


Hosting Turrent Scripts (where torrents are downloaded to our server, and you later on download from the server), like TorrentFlux.

Child porn (this is unrelated to adult material, which is allowed.
And if you wish to host adult material, it MUST be only accessible to 18+) 


Furthermore, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES can you promote your new domain by SPAMMING it to those typical million names email lists.
You don't like SPAM and neither does the next person the spammer is targeting.
