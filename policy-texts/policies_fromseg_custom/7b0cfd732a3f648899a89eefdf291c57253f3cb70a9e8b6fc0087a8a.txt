Process
Introduction and General Philosophy
This page outlines the process by which Meraki coordinates and delivers its technical support responses to its customers.
All processes outlined throughout this page apply to all Cisco Meraki products.
Cisco Meraki's general philosophy is to:
Provide the highest quality and fastest possible support directly to Cisco Meraki customers.
Deliver customer satisfaction; internally, the Cisco Meraki support team is evaluated on their customer satisfaction metrics and are responsible for delivering consistent measured customer satisfaction.
Ensure Cisco Meraki authorized resellers are properly supported during field installations and troubleshooting activities, assuming the support request is in regards to a currently licensed Meraki product.
Effectively track and coordinate customer interactions and support activities.
==========
Meraki Support Paradigm
All customers have an explicit support owner at all times.
Normally this is a Cisco Meraki support team member; however, during pre-sales product it could be a Cisco Meraki Systems Engineer, VAR, or other field sales resource.
All legitimate support requests are the responsibility of Cisco Meraki Support until closure, unless there is explicit agreement between Meraki Support and the customer to transfer management of the case to another party.
Unless discussed and agreed to by Cisco Meraki Support, all customer support communication flows through the Cisco Meraki Support Team.
This ensures:
Proper case management and recording
Proper follow up is achieved throughout case lifecycle
Customer satisfaction is the responsibility of the Cisco Meraki Support Team.
If a case is reassigned to another Meraki resource, or a Cisco Meraki authorized reseller, Cisco Meraki reserves the right to expect timely response from that party or Meraki Support may intervene to ensure customer satisfaction.
Privacy
The Cisco Meraki cloud management platform provides Support engineers with rich visibility into customer networks, resulting in faster diagnosis and resolution of cases.
==========
Our policies, outlined below, ensure that customer information is only accessed with prior consent, for the purposes of resolving a support case.
Support will not view customers' network configuration without prior consent
Support will not modify customers' network without prior consent
On rare occasions, support may view network status without prior notice to identify and diagnose system-wide issues.
In these cases, network configuration information, including security settings and policies, will not be accessed.
==========
Customers may remove Support's access to a network entirely by selecting "Prevent Meraki support from viewing this organization" in the Dashboard.
Once checked, Support will not be able to access any aspect of the network.
Customers will need to uncheck this box if technical assistance is required.
==========
Hours and SLAs
Meraki support operates 24x7 support out of five support centers based in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Shanghai, and Sydney.
Meraki has no support-specific licensing.
Customers may open an unlimited number of support cases with the purchase of any device license, and can contact Meraki by phone or email.
Service providers and resellers who offer fully managed network services using Meraki devices likewise may open an unlimited number of support cases and interact directly with Meraki support centers.
End customers (i.e. guests at a hotel) accessing networks supported or provided by service providers will contact the help desk for that Meraki Partner.
==========
Cloud Infrastructure
Cisco Meraki’s cloud infrastructure is covered under a 99.99% SLA and the Cisco Meraki Infrastructure team manages it 24×7×365 to ensure high availability.
In the extremely unlikely event of a cloud infrastructure interruption, user traffic and data continues to flow, and Meraki Support provides an emergency support SLA of 15 minutes.
Hours of Operation and SLA
Online / email support
Non-emergency support cases opened via email will be answered within one business day; usually within 2 hours.
Emergency support is offered exclusively via telephone to ensure that Meraki engineers can conduct appropriate troubleshooting and technical response.
Phone support
Phones at Meraki technical support centers are staffed 24×7×365 to ensure that one-on-one, phone-based technical support is always available from Meraki’s technical support engineers.
RMA Shipping
Meraki Support will ship new devices overnight from global distribution centers to a customer-specified location within 1 business day of any support case requiring the Advanced Replacement RMA of any device.
Delivery times to certain countries or remote destinations can vary.
Pro Networks
For Hours/SLA information on legacy Meraki “Pro” networks, please contact Meraki Support.
Case Escalations
In the event that any case cannot be immediately resolved, Meraki Support will escalate that case to appropriate engineering personnel within Support, Product and Sales Engineering according to the following schedule and priorities.
Generally, escalations are major issues that require notification and/or intervention by key portions of the company in order to ensure timely issue resolution.
==========
Priority Levels
Priority 1 — Major Impact: The network is inoperable or the performance of the network is so severely reduced that Licensee cannot reasonably continue to operate the network because of the Error and the Error cannot be circumvented with a Workaround.
Priority 2 — Moderate Impact: The network’s performance is significantly degraded such that Licensee’s Use of the network as permitted is materially impaired, but the Error can be circumvented with a Workaround.
Priority 3 — Minor Impact: Licensee is experiencing a performance, operational, or functional Error that can be circumvented with a Workaround and the Error causes only minimal impact to the Licensee’s ability to Use the network as authorized.
Priority 4 — General Questions: There is no issue with network performance or operation.
These include standard questions on network configuration or functionality, network enhancement requests, or documentation clarification.
==========
Cisco Meraki will trigger case escalations as necessary by priority level to ensure timely resolution of all cases.

Advance replacement orders will ship within 1 business day.
All Cisco Meraki hardware products come with either a one-year or lifetime warranty, as specified on the relevant Cisco Meraki data sheet.
In the event a customer RMA request is approved, Cisco Meraki will email an RMA number and a return shipping label free of charge.

Product End-of-Life (EOL) Policy
Cisco Meraki may find it necessary to discontinue products for a number of reasons, including product line enhancements, market demands, technology innovation, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer products.
We have set our end-of-life (EOL) policy to help customers better manage their product end-of-life transition.
When a product reaches EOL, Meraki is committed to communicating important milestones throughout the EOL period.
These notifications will include the initial EOL notification, the End of Sale (EOS) announcement, and the End of Support (EOST) dates, as well as other key information pertaining to Cisco Meraki products.
Any products being discontinued will be announced as End of Sale and identified on the Cisco Meraki website up to six months prior to the discontinuation and EOS date (also known as the last order date).
On the end of sale date, discontinued hardware products and related device-specific licenses are removed from the price list and are no longer available for purchase.
Cisco Meraki typically provides support for a given product for a period of seven (7) years after the EOS date.
If the discontinued product is not available for replacement or repair of an in-warranty return, Cisco Meraki may replace the discontinued product with functionally equivalent hardware and transfer the remaining license term from the replaced product to the replacement hardware.
Although legacy Cisco Meraki products typically can connect to our cloud-based management software for the entire useful life of the product, following the EOST Date, some things may change, including the following:
Cisco Meraki cannot guarantee that legacy hardware products will be able to connect to the management software indefinitely following the EOST Date;
Cisco Meraki Technical Support may no longer troubleshoot the legacy hardware products;
Cisco Meraki may no longer issue firmware updates or patches for the legacy products; and
New software features available for the management software may not be compatible with the legacy hardware functionality or with the firmware running on the legacy hardware.
If either of the first two situations above occurs, then we will use our best efforts to provide the customer with a workable solution for upgrading from the legacy hardware and, failing that, will credit the value of any remaining license time attributable to the legacy hardware to the customer’s Dashboard organization on a prorated basis.
==========

For example, when you access our Services, we automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Services (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), identifiers for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Services, the actions you take on our Services, and the content, features, and activities that you access and engage with on our Services.
==========
We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages from Meraki, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”).
We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, maintain and improve our Services and our other services and systems and to provide content that is tailored to you.
If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy.
==========
Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.
Please be aware that in the course of your use of the Services, websites or other services provided by third parties ("Third-Party Services"), including marketing or website optimization vendors, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their Third-Party Services or other services or content.
To do this, they may use first-party cookies (which are set by the same domain your browser is receiving data from) or third-party cookies (which are set by a different domain).
Meraki also may make non-personally identifiable information available to Third-Party Services, and these Third-Party Services may collect such information, to assist such parties in understanding our users’ activities and usage patterns on the Services.
If desired, you may use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to opt-out of having information collected by Google Analytics.
We do not have access to, or control over, the actions of Third-Party Services.
Each provider of Third-Party Services uses information that it collects in accordance with its own privacy and security policies.
Additionally, please be aware that Google and other third-party vendors may place or recognize one or more unique cookies on your computer when you use the Services, and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on our Services and on third-party websites and other Third-Party Services.
Google and these other third-party vendors may use information about those activities to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements.
In particular, we may use Google and other third-party vendors to engage in “remarketing,” in which advertisements you see on third-party websites and services may be based on your prior visits to our Services.
To learn more about these practices, and to opt-out from Google’s and other vendors’ use of information collected on the Services through cookies for advertising purposes, you may visit Google’s Ads Preferences Manager, TRUSTe's Preference Manager, or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
Please note that opting-out will not prevent advertisements from being served to you on the Internet; it will only result in advertisements that utilize cookies to serve advertisements on the specified advertising networks from which you opt-out no longer being targeted.
We are not responsible for the activities of other parties that may not comply with your opt-out requests.
We also use Google Conversion Tracking, which tracks whether users engage in certain activities (e.g., filling out a form to receive more information about our products or services) after they view one of our advertisements on a Third-Party Service.
Google uses cookies to track conversions and to report that information to us.

Finally, please also be aware that we use the Google Maps API as a source of maps, geographic data, and geolocation information for purposes of providing location-based information regarding terminal devices connected to networks managed by our Services and for providing related reporting and analysis.
Google may collect information, including personal information, from those who view content provided through the Google Maps API, and Google handles such information in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.
Network Usage Information Collected by Our Services
Some of our Services collect information from terminal devices connected to networks that are managed by those Services.
Those Services also collect information regarding the performance of, and certain other information regarding, such networks.
This information includes, for example, MAC address, device type, operating system, geolocation information, and network traffic information (e.g., hostnames, protocols, port numbers, and IP addresses).
This information is made available to administrators of networks managed by our Services through an online interface that we call the “dashboard”.
Additionally, if a Meraki customer elects to use our device management tool currently known as Systems Manager ("Systems Manager") and installs its software on, or configures the profile of, a mobile device or other device (e.g., a laptop computer) managed by Systems Manager, the customer or Meraki may undertake certain actions on the device, such as the following: (i) list, access, copy, move, and delete files; (ii) track and record device location over time; (iii) take and record screenshots; (iv) manage the device through remote desktop functionality; (v) set and enforce policies; and (vi) install/remove apps.
Finally, for devices with Systems Manager installed or devices that utilize Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, we transmit certain geolocation information about those devices and the network(s) on which they are running to Google, which provides us with related geolocation information that we store and make available to network administrators through our dashboard as described above in this paragraph.

License Co-Termination Summary
Following a customer’s initial license purchase, if the customer purchases a new license in connection with a new hardware unit or purchases a new license for an existing hardware unit, then the term of each license (new and existing) in the customer’s organization will be automatically adjusted so that all of the customer’s licenses terminate on the same date.
This concept is referred to as “co-termination” and is described in more detail below.
The following is a conceptual example.
==========
Assume the original purchase included ten APs, each with a 1-year license.
Also assume four months into the license term there are six additional APs added, each with a 1-year license.
Extra credit is applied with value of 4 additional months * 6 additional APs = 24 additional 'AP-months'.
This gives an additional 24 months / 16 total AP's in the organization = an additional 1.5 months to the license term for the whole organization.
==========
Detailed explanation of licensing co-termination
This section describes in detail each step of the co-termination algorithm which is reflected mathematically in the next section.
The dollar value of each license, for purposes of the co-termination calculation, is the one-year list price of the applicable license purchased (the “Base Price” of such license — see table of base prices below).
The co-termination date is then computed by, first, determining the amount of time remaining on the existing licenses in a customer’s organization by subtracting the license expiration date (available in the customer’s Dashboard account) from the current date (such difference, the “Remaining Days”).
The amount of additional time allocable to the new licenses purchased is determined by multiplying a one-year period of 365 days by the term (of years) of the new licenses purchased (the “New Time Purchased”) and subtracting from the New Time Purchased the number of days of Remaining Days (such difference, the “Incremental Days,” expressed in days).
The Incremental Days is then converted to a dollar-value unit of time by adding together, for each type of new license purchased, the product of (i) Incremental Time, (ii) the Base Price of the such new license-type purchased, and (iii) the number of such new license-type purchased (the sum of all such products, the “Incremental Dollar Days”).
==========
In order to determine how many additional days the new purchase adds to the license term of a customer’s organization, the daily usage rate of these dollar-value units of time must be calculated.
This is determined by adding together, for each type of license in the organization, the product of (i) the Base Price of each license type and (ii) the number of licenses of such type (the sum of all such products is your Network’s “Daily License Usage Rate”).
The actual number of incremental days to be added to the organization’s licenses as a result of the new purchase is calculated by dividing the Incremental Dollar Days by the Daily License Usage Rate (such quotient, the “Incremental TIme Purchased”).
The new co-termination date is finally calculated by adding the Incremental Time Purchased to the Remaining Days.

Mathematical Expression
This section expresses in mathematical terms the detailed explanation of the co-termination algorithm described in the previous section.
==========
Definitions:
Remaining_Time = Time remaining on life of original purchase, expressed in seconds
New_Time_Purchased = Life of new licenses purchased (i.e., 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, or 10-year)1
To calculate the new termination date of your network at the time of purchase of additional devices for your network:
Determine the amount of time remaining on your current network, before the new purchase, or 0, whichever is greater
Calculate Incremental_Network_Time purchased on new devices only
Convert Incremental_Network_Time into Incremental_Dollars_Days, for new devices only
Calculate the Daily License Usage Rate of your entire network, including all your existing and new devices
Convert Incremental_Dollars_Days into Incremental_Time_Purchased
Add Incremental_Time_Purchased to Remaining_Time to calculate Remaining_Time2 of your new network
Note 1: In the Meraki dashboard a unit of time is one second.
Examples
Co-Termination Example Problem A:
On January 1, 2013, you purchased and activated five Wireless MR16s with 1 year licenses for your network.
Today is May 8, 2013 (127 days later).
==========
You purchase and activate two MX80s with 3-year Advanced Security licenses to be added to your network.
Calculate in days the remaining time you have on your network.
Solution
Remaining_Time_1 = January 1,2014 - May 8,2013 = 238 days
Incremental_Network_Time = 1,095 days - 238 days = 857 days
Incremental_Dollars_Days = 857 days × $2,000 × 2 = 3,428,000 dollar days
Daily License Usage Rate = (5 MR16s × $150) + (2 MX80s × $2,000) = $4,750
Incremental_Time_Purchased = (3,428,000 dollars days) / $4,750 = 722 days
Remaining_Time_2 = 722 days + 238 days = 960 days remaining on new network
Co-Termination Example Problem B:
On January 1, 2013, you purchased and activated twenty wireless MR24s with 3-year licenses and one MX400 with a 3-year Advanced Security license for your network.
Today is May 8, 2013 (127 days later).
You purchase and activate an additional twenty-five wireless MR16s with 3-year licenses to be added to your network.
Calculate in days the remaining time you have on your network.
Solution
Calculate Co-Term of January 1, 2013 Purchase (adding MX400 to MR24s on same day)
Remaining_Time_1 = January 1,2016 - January 1,2013 = 1,095 days
Incremental_Network_Time = 1,095 days - 1,095 days = 0 days
Incremental_Dollars_Days = 0 days × $16,000 × 1 = 0 dollar days
Daily License Usage Rate = (20 MR24s × $150) + (1 MX400 × $16,000) = $19,000
Incremental_Time_Purchased = (0 dollars days) / $19,000 = 0 days
Remaining_Time_2 = 1,095 days + 0 days = 1,095 days remaining on new network

Calculate Co-Term of May 8, 2013 Purchase (adding twenty-five MR16s to existing network)
Remaining_Time_1 = January 1,2016 - May 8,2013 = 968 days
Incremental_Network_Time = 1,095 days - 968 days = 127 days
Incremental_Dollars_Days = 127 days × $150 × 25 = 476,250 dollar days
Daily License Usage Rate = (20 MR24s × $150) + (1 MX400 × $16,000) + (25 MR16s × $150) = $22,750
Incremental_Time_Purchased = (476,250 dollars days) / $22,750 = 21 days
Remaining_Time_2 = 968 days + 21 days = 989 days remaining on new network
Co-Termination Example Problem C:
On January 1, 2013, you purchased and activated fifteen Wireless MR16s with 5-year licenses.
On June 30, 2013, you purchased and activated one MX80 with a 3-year Advanced Security license.
Today is March 31, 2015 and you purchase and activate two MS42P Switch with a 1-year license.
Calculate in days the remaining time you have on your network.
Solution
Calculate Co-Term of June 30, 2013 Purchase (adding MX80 to MR16s)
Remaining_Time_1 = December 31,2017 - June 30,2013 = 1,645 days
Incremental_Network_Time = 1,095 days - 1,645 days = -550 days
Incremental_Dollars_Days = -550 days × $2,000 × 1 = -1,100,000 dollar days
Daily License Usage Rate = (15 MR16s × $150) + (1 MX80 × $2,000) = $4,250
Incremental_Time_Purchased = (-1,100,000 dollars days) / $4,250 = -259 days
Remaining_Time_2 = -259 days + 1,645 days = 1,386 days remaining on new network
Co-termination Date = June 30, 2013 + 1,386 days = April 16, 2017

Calculate Co-Term of March 31, 2015 Purchase (adding two MS42Ps to existing network)
Remaining_Time_1 = April 16,2017 - March 31,2015 = 747 days
Incremental_Network_Time = 365 days - 747 days = -382 days
Incremental_Dollars_Days= -382 days × $200 × 2 = -152,871 dollar days
Daily License Usage Rate = (15 MR16s × $150) + (1 MX80 × $2,000) + (2 MS42Ps × $200) = $4,650
Incremental_Time_Purchased = (-152,871 dollars days) / $4,650 = -33 days
Remaining_Time_2 = -33 days + 747 days = 714 days remaining on new network
Co-termination Date = March 31, 2015 + 714 days = March 14, 2017
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the exact unit of time that is used for the licensing calculations?
==========
Seconds.
“Incremental Dollar Days” are actually computed in terms of incremental seconds in order to ensure precision in calculating the term of the licenses purchased.
Once the exact expiration time is computed, actual license expiration is rounded to the nearest day and enforced at 9am Pacific Time on that day.
==========
What happens if I purchase a new order with multiple different license lengths (e.g., 1 MR24 with a 1-year license, 1 MS42P with a 1-year license, and 3 MX100s with 3-year licenses)?
Each iteration of the co-term formula is only run with respect to licenses of the same term.
So when new licenses are purchased on the same order with different terms, the co-term calculation is run multiple times.
The calculations are run in the order of license addition.
In the above example, the co-term calculation would first be run on the MR24 and MS42P, with the first co-term date calculated; a new co-term date would then be calculated using the first co-term date and the MX100 license for 3-years.
==========
What is the difference between license renewals and adding licenses/devices?
The co-termination calculation for renewals only (no new devices being added) is slightly different because the total license time in the customer’s organization is not being ‘spread’ across any additional devices in the case of a renewal.
Accordingly, when renewing the licenses for existing devices, the Incremental Dollar Days are calculated as a function of the entire term of the license (i.e., license term in years multiplied by a year of 365 days).
In contrast, when purchasing a license for a new devices, the Incremental Dollar Days is calculated as a function of the “Remaining Time,” that is, the difference between the term of the new license and the amount of time remaining under the customer’s existing licenses.
==========
Expressed mathematically, the difference in the two formulas is as follows:
Renewal Incremental_Dollar_Days = New_Time_Purchased * Count of Device * Device Base Price
New Device Incremental_Dollar_Days = (New_Time_Purchased - Remaining_Time) * Count of Device * Device Base Price
What happens when upgrading from enterprise to advanced security licenses?
When purchasing MX products, a customer must either choose Enterprise licenses for those products or Advanced Security licenses — but not both.
If a customer wants, for instance, to upgrade to the Advanced Security functionality on its MX devices and purchases new MX licenses, the co-termination calculation is re-run because the Advanced Security licenses are more expensive.
This means that both the Incremental Dollar Days and the Daily License Usage Rate will be adjusted since each is calculated as a function of the Base Price of the licenses.
Is there a place I can easily run a sample co-termination calculation myself?
==========
