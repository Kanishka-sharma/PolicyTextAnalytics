This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") will tell you what information we collect about you and about your use of our Web site (“Site”).
It will explain how we protect that information and what choices you have about how it is used.
We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you will understand clearly how SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST, INC or SXSW, INC ("SXSW") may collect and use information provided by you.
SXSW will inform you of the following in this privacy policy:

What personally identifiable information of yours is collected;
What organization is collecting the information;
How the information is used;
With whom the information may be shared;
What choices are available regarding collection, use and distribution of the information;

The information you provide in a SXSW public forum could be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.

I. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY SXSW OR ON SXSW'S BEHALF
A.
In General
Personally identifiable information (PII or Personal Information) is information that can be used to identify or contact you.
We collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in two general and distinct ways: (1) when you choose to purchase various services or products offered by SXSW and/or its affiliated business partners, or (2) when you choose to participate in surveys or send e-mails to SXSW.
This Site is not intended for use by persons under thirteen (13) years of age.
SXSW does not knowingly collect Personal Information from or about children under the age of thirteen (13).
==========
B. Registration And Other Information
You may view or use our Site without registering or submitting any Personal Information.
In that case, the only information we collect will be non-personal information collected through the use of cookies or web beacons (see details below).
However, in order to have access to certain products and services available on the Site, you are required to complete a registration form and provide other information, including Personal Information, reasonably necessary for us to provide the products and/or services for you.
C. Cookies
We collect anonymous, non-confidential, and non-personal information when you use our site, send us e-mails, or respond to special promotions or newsletters that we may send to you from time to time.
For example, cookies are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive that allow us to know how often someone visits a site and the activities they conduct while on that site (such as the chat rooms you visited, whether you submitted orders for services or products, etc.).
==========
Every computer is assigned a different cookie by SXSW.
The information collected by cookies helps us dynamically generate advertising and content on web pages or in e-mails specifically designed for you and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and selected affiliated business partners sites, or are opening our e-mails.
We may use cookie information to target certain advertisements to your browser or to determine the popularity of certain content or advertisements.
It may be possible to link non-personal cookie information to Personal Information collected.
You may be able to turn off cookies in your browser, but this may hinder our ability to provide you with certain services or your ability to enjoy certain features of the Site.
==========
D. Web Beacons
In limited circumstances we also may use "web beacons" to collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our Web site and the sites of selected affiliated partners, and your use of e-mails, special promotions or newsletters we may send to you from time to time.
Web beacons are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or e-mail that provide a presence on the web page or e-mail and send back to its home server information from the Users' browser.
The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and selected affiliated business partners sites, or are opening our e-mails, and for what purposes.
It may be possible to link non-personal web beacon information to Personal Information collected.
E. E-mails and Newsletters
As noted in the discussions of cookies and web beacons (see above), we collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of e-mails and newsletters that we may send to you from time to time.
In some cases, when you click on a link or an advertisement in an e-mail or newsletter, your browser may be momentarily directed to the site of a third party which, acting on SXSW's behalf (see Disclosure to Web site Service and Content Contractors, below), notes or "counts" your response to the e-mail or newsletter before re-directing your browser to its proper destination.
==========
This re-direction process will not be apparent to you.
F. Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on SXSW's Behalf
Sponsors, business partners or advertisers on the Site or in e-mails, special promotions or newsletters we may send to you from time to time may also use their own cookies or web beacons when you click on their advertisement or link to their site or service, or even if the advertisement simply appears on a page or in an e-mail that you are viewing.
Some advertisers use companies other than SXSW to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-personal information through the use of cookies or web beacons on our Web site.
In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor, business partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its proper destination (e.g., back to SXSW to show the ad, or to the advertiser's Web site); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.
We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them.
However, you should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites.
==========
G. Public Forums
This Privacy Policy does not apply when you use SXSW's public forums if and when they become available.
As a service to our users, SXSW may feature chat rooms and bulletin boards where users can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for other users to answer.
You should be aware that any information shared in a chat room, bulletin board, or other type of posting is public information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy.
You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any public forum.
==========
H. E-mails to SXSW
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information, such as business information, resumes, ideas, concepts or inventions sent to SXSW by e-mail to the various SXSW's departments listed on the SXSW's Web site.
If you want to keep business information, resumes, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an e-mail to SXSW.
We try to answer every e-mail in a timely manner, but are not always able to do so.

II.
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may release Personal Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a financial threat to you or others.

You can only access these co-branded content and products and/or services through the Channel Partner Web site.
==========
The co-branded SXSW pages that you may access through a Channel Partner Web site have different registration processes and opportunities for information collection, and Personal Information that you provide on these pages may be shared with the Channel Partners.
Each of these co-branded SXSW sites has its own privacy policy posted on that site.
Therefore, if you visit one of these co-branded SXSW sites, please read the privacy policy that is posted on that site, as well as the individual privacy policy of the Channel Partner Web site.

In addition to the Third Party Contractor Web sites that you may access as described above, for your convenience there are links to Web sites operated by companies other than SXSW that are not contractors who provide content, products, and/or services through our Web site ("Third Party Web sites").
These links may be found in advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or logos of sponsors or affiliated business partners of SXSW.
SXSW does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Web sites without obtaining your consent.
SXSW does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites.
If you choose to link to one of these Third Party Web sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on this other site to understand how that Third Party Web site collects and uses your Personal Information.
G. Disclosure of Aggregate Information
SXSW may provide to third parties non-personal information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted and that is combined with the non-personal information of other users ("Aggregate Information").
For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our site and the activities they conduct while on our site.
We might also inform a company that performs services or that provides products and/or services to SXSW (that may or may not be a SXSW business partner or an advertiser on our site) that "50% of our users live in the USA" or that "85% of our users have purchased products and/or services which can be downloaded from SXSW's Web site."
==========
Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate Information.
We may not limit the third parties' use of the Aggregate Information.

We implement appropriate measures and processes to protect your Personal Information and maintain its quality, such as encryption.
