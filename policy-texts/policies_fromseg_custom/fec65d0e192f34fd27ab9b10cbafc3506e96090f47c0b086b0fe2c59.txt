COMET SYSTEMS COMMITMENT TO USER PRIVACY
Comet Systems™

 takes its responsibility towards user privacy very seriously.
In fact, Comet is committed not only to our users' privacy but to their anonymity.
In the course of downloading the Comet Cursor®, you are never required to provide your name or email address or any other personally identifiable information.
This makes Comet different from most other software companies, who routinely ask for names and email addresses.
Because we do not require any personally identifiable information, people who use the Comet Cursor can remain anonymous.
==========
Many people are concerned about ad networks profiling and tracking people's online surfing habits.
Comet Systems doesn't profile Comet Cursor users or track user habits, and never has.
Comet Systems does not sell or rent any information about Comet Cursor users to third parties.
All we do is count the numbers of cursors displayed at our partner sites in an anonymous fashion.
And since you're never required to tell us your email address, you don't get spammed from downloading our software.
Some inaccurate information appeared in late 1999 regarding our information practices.

We thank these publications for reconsidering their stories in light of the facts, and we hope that all members of the press and public will take privacy issues as seriously as we do at Comet Systems.
