Registration
In order to receive and/or access some services, users have to complete a registration form.
During registration, a user is required to give contact information (such as name and e-mail address).
This information may be used to contact the user about the services for which they have expressed interest and also about other goods, services and features IOP believes that the user will find interesting.
It is optional for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers, but it is encouraged so that IOP can provide a more personalised experience.
If a user chooses not to provide such information then they will not be able to access parts of this website and/or will not be able to use all the services offered by this website.
A user may contact IOP about use of their personal information, edit it on this website and/or tell IOP not to use it in certain ways by sending an e-mail message to data.protection@iop.org.

Cookies
A cookie is a small text file written to a user's hard drive and does not contain any personally identifiable information.
The use of cookies is now widespread.
The reason IOP uses cookies is to save its users time on this website (so that they do not have to log in more than once) and also so that IOP can personalise a user's experience of this website.
If a user sets up their browser to reject the cookie, they may still use this website although functionality will be impaired.
Please note that if you decide to utilise a service provided by a third party via this website (e.g. a social bookmarking service), then such third party may use cookies during the provision of such service.
IOP is not responsible for the use of cookies by such third parties, and users are encouraged to read the privacy statements of those third party service providers before using the service.

Surveys and contests
From time-to-time this website may request information from users via surveys or contests.

Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of this website.
Correcting/updating personal data
If a user's personal data changes (such as their postcode), or if a user no longer desires IOP's service, IOP will correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to it.
This can usually be done by the user within any personalisation options of this website or by sending an email to custserv@iop.org.
==========
Notification of changes
If IOP decides to change its Privacy Policy, it will make the updated version available via this website so its users are always aware of what information it collects, how it uses it and under what circumstances, if any, it discloses it.
If, at any point, it decides to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, it will notify users.
Users will have a choice as to whether or not IOP uses their information in this different manner.
IOP will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.
Your privacy is important to us
