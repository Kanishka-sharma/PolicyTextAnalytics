YOUR RIGHTS: PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCESS, RETENTION, CORRECTION, DELETION, AND CHOICE
U.S. Website Users:
Opt-Out of Marketing Communications
With regard to Personal Information that you have provided or that has been collected under this Privacy Policy, you may opt out of uses for marketing purposes, such as correspondence from Us about our products and promotions or the sharing by Us of your Personal Information with select third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
You may opt out by using the rights request form, checking the “Other data request(s)” box, and instructing Us that you wish to opt out of uses for marketing purposes.
For verification purposes, each rights request form is tied to a particular email address, so if you have multiple email addresses, then you will need to submit multiple forms.
We do this to protect your privacy rights.
If you do not exercise your opt-out preference initially upon account creation, it may take up to thirty (30) days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective.

When you make a request, We may ask you for information in order to verify your request, including your email address that may have been provided to Us.
You may sign up to receive newsletters or other communications from Us.
If you would like to discontinue receiving this information, you may update your email preferences by using the "Unsubscribe" link found in emails We send to you.

Unless prohibited by applicable law, your opt-out preference does not apply to (i) any communication that is not promotional in nature, (ii) sharing and use by Us of your Personal Information with service providers used by Us to enhance your experience on our Websites, and (iii) to allow Us to provide you with more personalized advertising across the internet.
Your California Privacy Rights
California law requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes.
Alternatively, such businesses may adopt a policy of not disclosing Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes if a California resident opts out.
Healthline provides you with a cost-free means to opt out of such sharing.
If you do not want Healthline to disclose information to other companies for their marketing purposes, please follow the opt-out procedures set forth above.
==========
You may also use the rights request form, checking the “Other data request(s)” box, and instructing Us to no longer share your personal information with third parties who will use it for direct marketing purposes.
For verification purposes, each rights request form is tied to a particular email address, so if you have multiple email addresses, then you will need to submit multiple forms.
We do this to protect your privacy rights.
