a. Identity Verification.
We require checks for Creators to ensure that we do not knowingly offer
              our Services to or collect personal data from anyone under 18 or anyone using a false identity,
              and offer checks as an option for Fans.
==========
These checks involve providing certain information to one
              or more of our service providers, currently Ondato, Aristotle, and Jumio which verify your
              identity.
If you commence the registration process, you do so with the understanding that your
              personal data will be transferred to Ondato and processed subject to their privacy policy and
              terms and conditions, Aristotle and processed subject to their
              privacy policy and terms and conditions, or Jumio and
              processed subject to their privacy policy and terms and conditions.
Ondato, Aristotle, and Jumio all require that you submit your passport or other
              government identification document, and use facial analysis software to verify your identity.
Ondato also requires that you provide a photo of yourself holding your government identification
              as part of the verification process.
==========
b. Payment Information.
Payments made by Fans to access content are processed by our third
              party payment providers.
For example, when you make a payment that is processed by a
              payment provider, you will provide that third party with your credit card number, credit card
              expiration date, and security code, which they process and store subject to their privacy policy
              and terms of service.
We do not receive your full credit card number, credit card expiration date,
              or the security code.
Instead, the payment provider provides us with a “token” that represents
              your account, your card’s expiration date, card type and the first two and last four digits of your
              card number.
==========
If you are required to provide your name and email address to the payment
              provider, then they also provide us with that information.
Payments issued to Creators for their
              content are made by OnlyFans using the bank account information that we have collected and
              stored.
==========
c. Collection of Personal Data from Children.
Our Services are not intended for anyone under 18.
Anyone under 18 years of age is not permitted to use the Services, and we do not knowingly
              collect information from children under the age of 18.
By using the Services, you represent that
              you are 18 years of age or older.

              operations or assets to a third party, whether by merger, acquisition or otherwise.
Personal data
              we obtain from or about you via the Services may be disclosed to any potential or actual third-
              party acquirers and may be among those assets transferred.
==========
f. Do Not Track.
We currently do not use any cross-site tracking technologies and do not currently
              process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or similar mechanisms.

              however, that you may find information about how to block or reject certain tracking
              technologies in our Cookie Notice.
