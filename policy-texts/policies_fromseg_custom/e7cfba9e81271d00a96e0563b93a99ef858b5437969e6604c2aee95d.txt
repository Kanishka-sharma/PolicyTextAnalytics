1 -About Criteo’s services 
 
Criteo specializes in creating personalized advertisements.
We work with online partners to build advertisements for users who visit their website or mobile applications and with publishers to display personalized advertisements.
Our aim is to deliver advertisements by displaying products and/or personalized banners that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing behavior.
For example, if you visit and browse on Website/mobile application A, on a subsequent online visit to Website/mobile application B, you will see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website/mobile application A.
 
With our service, you should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Criteo.

2 – Our technology 
 
Online web environment: (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)
 
Criteo “tags” visitors to its partners’ websites with anonymous browser cookies.
Users tagged by Criteo are given an anonymous identifier.
At no point does Criteo collect personal data, such as your name or address.
==========
The browser cookies track the products viewed by the visitor and pages visited of the partner for whom Criteo is delivering ads.
Pixel tags are used by Criteo to transfer anonymous data from our partner's websites to Criteo's servers.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
==========
There are two types of cookies:
Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate on websites.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
Persistent cookies are used to run our technology as they enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our partners’ websites.
Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your internet browser’s ‘help’ file.
What are pixel tags?
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon) is an industry-standard, often-transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed in a website.
==========
Our partners’ advertisements are displayed on many websites, also known as “publishers.”
These publishers may also place cookies on your browser.
These cookies are there so that the publishers recognize that Criteo has a personalized advertisement available for your browser.
Other environments (Mobile applications) 
 
In environments that do not support cookies, like mobile applications, we may use other anonymous technologies for the same purpose of cookies.
To serve our ads in mobile applications we collect identifiers, such as Google Advertising ID or IDFA depending on the operating system of your mobile device.
These identifiers consist in a string of anonymous and random characters singling out your device that Criteo stored by Criteo with a hash (non reversible encrypting method).
3 - Data collection and use
 
 We collect anonymous information  
 We do not collect any personal information 

We collect only anonymous data through anonymous cookies or equivalent identifiers that record:
events related to your activity on the partner’s website (such as the number of pages viewed, the products you viewed on that website, your searches made on the partner’s website)
information provided by trusted partners that may include socio-demographic data such as age range,
information related to your device (device type, operating system, version)
and events related to the Criteo ad serving activity such as the number of ads displayed to you.
We do know that the internet browser and/or mobile operating system you are using has visited one of our partner sites in the last thirty days.
We do not know who you are.
We do not know your address, your place of work, your date of birth, your email address, your phone number or any other personally identifiable information about you.
