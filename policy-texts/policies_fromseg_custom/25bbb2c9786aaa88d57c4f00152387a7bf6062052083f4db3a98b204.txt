Our Service is not intended for and may not be used by individuals under 13 years of age except as provided by the Educational Use Section of these Terms.
By registering for a Calendly account, you state that you are at least 18 years of age, and you are responsible for ensuring that all Calendly Users and Invitees are at least 13 years old.
Creating an account with false information is a violation of our Terms, including creating an account on behalf of others or persons under the age of 18.
Educational Use.

To the extent that Calendly has access to “education records,” as defined by FERPA and its implementing regulations, it is deemed and shall function as a “school official” with “legitimate educational interests” when fulfilling its responsibilities under this Agreement, and both parties agree that you have “direct control” over the use of “education records” as these terms are defined under FERPA.

Additionally, you shall be responsible for verifying the student parent relationship and shall be responsible for compliance with the right of a parent to review personal information provided by the child.
You shall comply with such requirements by requesting and providing Calendly with a data subject request for the aforementioned data, or any changes to such data requested by the parent, and providing the data to the parent after verification of the student parent relationship.

It's incredibly helpful and helps us to make a better Calendly for all.

Intellectual Property Infringement.
We respect the intellectual property rights of others and encourage you to do the same.
Accordingly, we have a policy of removing Submissions that violate intellectual property rights of others, suspending access to the Services (or any portion thereof) to any Calendly User who uses the Services in violation of someone’s intellectual property rights, and/or terminating in appropriate circumstances the account of any Calendly User who uses the Services in violation of someone’s intellectual property rights.
==========

If you believe your copyright or other intellectual property right is being infringed by a Calendly User, please provide written notice to us for notice of claims of infringement at support@calendly.com.
To be sure the matter is handled immediately, your written notice must:

We will notify you that we have removed or disabled access to copyright-protected material that you provided, if such removal is pursuant to a validly received Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) take-down notice.
In response, you may provide us with a written counter-notification that includes the following information:

Limitation of Liability.
==========
CALENDLY WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR DISPLAYING, COPYING, OR DOWNLOADING ANY DOCUMENTATION TO OR FROM THE WEBSITE.
IN NO EVENT WILL CALENDLY BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, AND OTHERWISE, FOR ANY: (a) CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, ENHANCED, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; (b) INCREASED COSTS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR LOST BUSINESS, PRODUCTION, REVENUES, OR PROFITS; (c) LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION; (d) USE, INABILITY TO USE, LOSS, INTERRUPTION, DELAY, OR RECOVERY OF ANY DATA, OR BREACH OF DATA OR SYSTEM SECURITY; OR (e) COST OF REPLACEMENT GOODS OR SERVICES, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CALENDLY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND CALENDLY AND SHALL APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF CALENDLY HAS BEEN TOLD OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF THESE REMEDIES FAIL THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
==========
Local Laws; Export Control.
We control and operate the Services from our headquarters in the United States of America and the entirety of the Services may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations.
If you use the Services outside the United States of America, you are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.
Calendly and you shall comply with all relevant United States export control laws and regulations.
Without limiting the foregoing: (a) you acknowledge that the Services may be subject to the United States Export Administration Regulations; (b) you affirm that you are not, and you will not (i) permit Calendly Users or Invitees to access or use the Services in a United States embargoed country; (ii) or permit Calendly Users or Invitees on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Denied Persons, Entity, or Unverified Lists or (iii) permit Calendly Users or Invitees on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Consolidated Sanctions list; and (c) you are responsible for complying with any local laws and regulations which may impact your right to import, export, access, or use the Services.
==========
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver.
Please Read This Provision Carefully.
It Affects Your Legal Rights.
This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute that may arise between you and us.
==========
Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
This provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.
==========
We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation.
To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).
==========
YOU AND CALENDLY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution
For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to cure or resolve the dispute which is first done by emailing us at support@calendly.com the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.
If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your dispute in arbitration.
Arbitration Procedures
If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings.
==========
JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.
The arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.
This provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.
Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.
Because these Services and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.
However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
You or we may initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the U.S federal judicial district where you are located.
==========
Class Action Waiver
Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Calendly specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.
Other
You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.
If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.
If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.
==========
This provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.
==========
General Terms.
We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel that you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell you.
==========
We may even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s) if possible.
However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by us, may require immediate termination of your access to this Website without prior notice to you.
==========
The Federal Arbitration Act, Georgia state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts located in Fulton County, Georgia.
Except as otherwise set forth in the dispute resolution provision, if any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) will be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.
==========
By choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our rights.
These Terms, together with our Privacy Notice, End User License Agreement, FERPA COPPA Privacy Policy, and the Data Processing Addendum (as applicable), contain the entire agreement between you and us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between Calendly and you about the Services.
Any definitions found in the Privacy Notice, End User License Agreement, FERPA COPPA Privacy Policy, and Data Processing Addendum are hereby adopted by reference in this Agreement.
The rights of Calendly under our Terms will survive the termination of this Agreement.
==========
No additional terms, conditions, consent, waiver, alteration, or modification shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties.
Acceptance of any order by Calendly is expressly limited to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Any proposed additional or inconsistent terms or conditions, including those in or accompanying any Customer proposal, any Customer purchase order, or other agreement or any other Customer document issued in connection with the sale or delivery of Products or Services is deemed by Calendly to be a material change and is objected to and rejected by Calendly.
