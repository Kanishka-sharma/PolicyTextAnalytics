This section of the Privacy Policy applies only if you use our website or Services covered by this Privacy Policy from a country that is a Member State of the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.
Controller of Personal Information
To the extent that American Airlines, Inc. is subject to the laws of the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland when processing personal data (“Personal Data”), it shall be the “data controller” under such laws.
==========
If you have made a flight booking with us but one or more flights or services (including, for example, access to travel lounges operated by our partner airlines) are to be provided by other airline(s), then that other airline will also separately be considered a “data controller”.
Your Personal Data will be processed in accordance with the applicable airline’s privacy policy and, if your booking is made via a reservation system provider (“GDS”), with its privacy policy.
These are available at http://www.iatatravelcentre.com/privacy or from the airline or GDS directly.
==========
You should read this documentation, which applies to your booking and specifics (for example, how your personal data is collected, stored, used, disclosed and transferred).
Any travel services provider (such as a hotel or car rental company) or AAdvantage® participating partner (such as an AAdvantage® co-branded credit card issuer) will also separately be a “data controller”.
==========
For information on how those parties collect, use, and protect your information, you may obtain copies of their privacy policies by contacting them directly or visiting their websites.
Legal Basis for Data Processing
We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above.
==========
Our legal basis to process Personal Data includes processing that is:

necessary for the performance of the contract between you and American (for example, to facilitate your travel on American under our conditions of carriage, to provide you with other services that you request, or for resolving billing or customer service inquiries related to your use of our Services); 
necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules or to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); 
necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the website and our Services); 
to protect the vital interests of you or another person (for example, if we collect and process medical information in the event of a medical emergency and you are incapable of giving your consent); 
to perform a task carried out in the public or substantial public interest (for example, to provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility opportunity for air travel comparable to those of other persons); and
where legally required and we have no other valid legal basis to process Personal Data, we will use consent by our customers (for example, to provide you with marketing information or share information with third parties), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by emailing privacy@aa.com) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Email privacy@aa.com
										
											


In some instances, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services, and for you to use all the features of our website.
==========
International Transfers of Personal Data
The nature of American’s business means that the Personal Data collected through our Services will be transferred to the United States.
Also, the American personnel and some of the third-parties to whom we disclose Personal Data (as set out above) may be located in the United States and other countries outside of the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, including in countries to which you fly and that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country.
We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality and we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data, remains protected and secure.
==========
A copy of these clauses can be requested by emailing privacy@aa.com.

Your Rights
As described above in the “Local Laws” section, under data protection laws in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, you have certain rights related to your Personal Data.
==========
You may be entitled to exercise the right to:

object to the processing of Personal Data (for instance, where the basis of our processing is our legitimate interests, see section above “Legal Basis for Data Processing”), and we will stop processing your data.
We will not resume processing unless we can establish compelling legitimate grounds that override your rights.
request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data (for instance, this can be done if the Personal Data is not accurate and needs to be updated).
This can also be done in relation to data where the purposes of processing no longer apply, but you still need the data and do not want us to erase it.
==========
request updating of your Personal Data (if you believe the information we have about you is not accurate or incomplete).
You may ask us to update your Personal Data but we cannot modify it for previously flown bookings because that is the official record of the transaction.
==========
request access to your Personal Data (for instance, if you wish to receive a copy of your information, confirmation as to whether we are processing your information, and information as to how we use your information), You may request access to your Personal Data but that may not include information relating to others that you either did not provide to us or who have not consented to the disclosure of their information to you.
request erasure of your Personal Data (for instance, if we have no legal basis to process the information and you have not given us your consent to do so, if the purposes of processing no longer apply, or if you have objected to the processing and we cannot establish compelling legitimate grounds to override your rights).
Certain data may not be erased if we have a requirement to retain it for legal purposes, or if we have a contract with you as a member of AAdvantage® or Business Extra (as we need to be able to perform contractual obligations owed to you).
==========
You may ask us to delete your Personal Data, but we cannot do so if you have a pending flight booked with us.
request portability of your own Personal Data (the transfer of information you have provided to us, to another controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format), if such a request is technically possible to complete.
==========
To exercise these rights please email us at privacy@aa.com.
Email privacy@aa.com
										
											


When we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we will indicate what Personal Data we require from you to validate your identity.
==========
We will also provide information on the action we intend to take on the request in accordance with applicable law.
We will respond to your request as soon as possible and no later than 30 days from receipt of the request.
In certain circumstances this time may be extended by an additional two months, for example, where requests are complex or onerous.
==========
You may always contact our Data Protection Officer, at privacy@aa.com.
If you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law, you may submit a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Email privacy@aa.com
