AWS classifies customer data into two categories: customer content and account information.
We define customer content as software (including machine images), data, text, audio, video, or images that a customer or any end user transfers to us for processing, storage, or hosting by AWS services in connection with that customer's account, and any computational results that a customer or any end user derives from the foregoing through their use of AWS services.
For example, customer content includes content that a customer or any end user stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
Customer content does not include account information, which we describe below.
The terms of the AWS Customer Agreement and the AWS Service Terms apply to your customer content.
We define account information as information about a customer that a customer provides to us in connection with the creation or administration of a customer account.
For example, account information includes names, usernames, phone numbers, email addresses, and billing information associated with a customer account.
The information practices described in the AWS Privacy Notice apply to account information.
