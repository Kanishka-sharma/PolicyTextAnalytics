Cookies


			  Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device.
They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions.
Cookies serve many useful purposes.
For example:
			  
Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.

Samsung Global Privacy Policy—Smart TV Supplement


			  Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with gestures and voice commands.
We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy.
This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.
==========
Interactive and Customized Content
			  

			  The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content.
For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.
In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your zip code.
==========
In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience.
We base these recommendations and additional services on:
              
Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices;
Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;
Information about your clicks on the “Like,” “Dislike,” “Watch Now,” and other buttons on your Smart TV;
The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;
Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, information stored in cookies and similar technologies, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.
Please visit the “settings” menu of your Smart TV for choices that may be available to you if you do not wish to continue to receive personalized recommendations or certain enhanced features on your Smart TV.
If you disable such personalized recommendations or additional features, then the information and content displayed on your Smart TV may not be as relevant to you.
Samsung may still collect information about your usage of the Smart TV for the purposes described in this Samsung Privacy Policy.
==========
Interactive Interest-Based Marketing
By enabling Interactive and Interest Based marketing features, you may make the content and advertising that you receive on your Smart TV and other devices when you are watching Smart TV more interactive and in tune with your viewing preferences.
TV programming providers or advertisers can enhance video programs by providing interactive content, such as in-program trivia, show insights, games, and promotions, on your Smart TV or other devices.
Similarly, advertisers can enhance their ads by enabling users to take immediate action (e.g., downloading a coupon or app) in response to an ad.
To make these kinds of enhancements and interest based marketing available, we collect video or audio snippets of the program you’re watching and use this information in order to return content or advertising “synched” to what you’re watching.
==========
Viewing history will also include information about your device (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers) and your interactions with the content and advertising they provide.
You may disable these interactive interest based marketing features at any time by visiting the “settings” menu.
The choices you make with respect to interactive marketing features will not affect whether you receive other types of ads and marketing on your Smart TV.
PSID
Your viewing history and Smart TV usage information for the purposes of providing interactive and interest based marketing will be linked to an anonymous, one-way hashed, resettable device identifier called the “PSID”.
You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the settings menu on your Smart TV, and once reset your viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest based marketing will be cleared and de-linked.
Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.
==========
Voice Recognition
You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.
If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice.
==========
To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some interactive voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider (currently, Nuance Communications, Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text and to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you.
In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features.
Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands only when you make a specific search request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control.
If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use interactive voice recognition features, although you may be able to control your TV using certain predefined voice commands.
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the “settings” menu.
However, this may prevent you from using some of the Voice Recognition features 
Third Parties
Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third-party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g., your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service.
==========
Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices.
You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.
