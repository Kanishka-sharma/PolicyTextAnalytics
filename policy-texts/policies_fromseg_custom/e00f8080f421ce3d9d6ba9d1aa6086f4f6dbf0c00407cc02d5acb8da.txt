INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF LOCAL STORAGE
What is local storage?
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device.
This technology is similar to cookies in that only non-sensitive data is stored, but has a greater storage limit.
When web storage is used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions (meaning that data are retrievable even after the browser window has been closed and reopened).
One technology that facilitates web storage (and local storage) is HTML 5.
What type of properties do we store in local storage?

Modern browsers allow you to delete the data in local storage (also referred to as "website data", "browsing data" or "other data" in some browsers) by using the privacy settings associated with that browser.
Most browsers also now offer the option to accept, prompt for or block the storage of local data.
