Overview
The following information reflects the AVMA's commitment to maintain our Web site visitors' rights to privacy and the confidentiality of personal information.
The AVMA takes extensive measures to ensure the safety and security of its Web site servers and the information contained on them and to guard against divulging private information.
General Information
If you send us an email, you should know that email is not necessarily secure against interception.
The AVMA discourages sending of confidential information by e-mail.
==========
If your communication includes sensitive information such as your credit card information, and you prefer not to use one of our secure online forms, contact us by postal mail, fax or telephone rather than email.
Credit card information will be used by the AVMA solely as authorized by the sender and will not be used in any other manner or shared with any third party except as needed to conduct the requested transaction.
Only authorized AVMA personnel can access credit card information and solely for the purpose of processing the user's request and performing adjustments or refunds at the user's request.
Links
Our Web sites contain links to documents and pages located on Web sites maintained by various other organizations.
Once you select a link that takes you to another Web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that Web site.
==========
Security
The AVMA uses generally accepted, industry-standard security systems, software, and encryption technologies to protect against unauthorized access to our servers, equipment, and other components of our online presence.
This includes the use of secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect the transmission of information you submit to us when you use our secure online forms on www.avma.org.
All the information you provide us through these forms is stored securely offline.
You will know that an online form is secure if "https://" appears at the beginning of the address line in your browser; if "http://" appears at the beginning, the page is not secure.
==========
The AVMA has procedures in place for protecting personal information, including but not limited to: use of firewalls; frequent updates to security and virus-protection software; and storing any personal information collected online on a secure offline server that is not accessible from the Internet.
