Rubicon Project Privacy Dashboard and Opt-Out
Last Updated: December 19, 2014
Our Privacy Dashboard is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and our products and services.
Only 22% of Internet Users regularly review privacy policies for the sites they visit.
That is why this Dashboard does not look like other privacy policies you may have seen.
Unlike the average privacy policy which is approximately 2,500 words, the Rubicon Project offers this simple summary.
Like any summary, however, the Privacy Dashboard is not an exhaustive description of our privacy practices and should not be construed to define or limit the scope or extent of our Privacy Policies which can be found at the locations identified below.
