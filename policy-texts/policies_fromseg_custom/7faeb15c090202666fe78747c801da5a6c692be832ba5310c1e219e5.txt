Privacy Policy

Privacy on AOL.com - An Overview

		America Online, Inc. (AOL) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers 
		of its interactive products and services.
Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute 
		to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers.
The purpose of this AOL.com privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to 
		AOL.com, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit AOL.com, how 
		we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have 
		regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.
This privacy 
		policy applies to the AOL.com site and other Internet-accessible AOL-branded services 
		like AOL Instant Messenger that incorporate this policy (although we will refer here 
		only to AOL.com to make reading this policy easier).
The AOL Internet online service 
		has a separate privacy policy for its members.
If you are a member of the AOL service, 
		you can find that policy within AOL's Terms of Service (AOL keyword "TOS").
Other AOL 
		products and services may also have their own privacy policies, which you should review 
		when you use these services.
Finally, please note that this policy applies only to 
		AOL.com, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link.
Information About All AOL.com Visitors

		In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers 
		and frequency of visitors to AOL.com and its areas, very much like television ratings 
		that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program.
==========
We only use such data in 
		the aggregate.
This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts 
		of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can 
		make it for as many of you as possible.
For example, AOL.com uses a technology 
		nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how 
		many people.
These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do 
		not combine information collected through these cookies with other personally 
		identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail 
		address is.
We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information 
		about you personally, to our AOL.com partners about how our members, collectively, use 
		AOL.com.
We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our 
		site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well.
Finally, AOL.com, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as small 
		pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs," to determine on an anonymous basis 
		which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but 
		do not use these technologies to collect personally identifiable information unless you 
		give us permission to do so.
Information About You

		If you are an AOL member, when you access AOL.com you may obtain access to features of 
		the AOL online service that contain personal information, such as e-mail and  My 
		Portfolios.
==========
Additionally, we may specifically ask for information about you when you 
		sign up to use a service, like AOL Instant Messenger, or when you order a product.
We 
		will need certain information — such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing 
		address, type of computer, credit card number — in order to provide that service or 
		product to you.
We may also use that information to let you know of additional products 
		and services about which you might be interested.
You can choose not to receive such 
		information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you 
		sign up for the product or service.
We may ask you for information about your interests 
		so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, 
		but you may always choose to respond or not.
Additionally, we may provide you with an 
		opportunity to be listed in a directory on one of our AOL-branded services — these 
		listings are also optional and you can make changes to or eliminate this information 
		when you want to.
==========
We also use cookie technology in order to improve your experience, 
		including to remember your preferences or customized settings when you use AOL.com and 
		its related services, and to authenticate your access to your personal information.
Disclosure

		We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to AOL.com or 
		information that you may give us on AOL.com, such as your name, address, email address 
		or telephone number, to any outside companies.
AOL.com may share such information in 
		response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or in special cases such 
		as a physical threat to you or others.
And, as we mention above, we may share with our 
		Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use 
		of AOL.com.
==========
Kids on AOL.com

		AOL takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people using our 
		services, and encourages you to participate in your child's experience in cyberspace.
AOL.com is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about 
		children.
For parents who are AOL members, AOL recommends that parents review AOL's 
		important safety tips before your child explores the Internet, and use AOL's Parental 
		Controls.
You can also obtain additional information about safe surfing through the 
		Federal Trade Commission 
		web site.
AOL.com Privacy Policy Changes

		If we decide to change our privacy policy for AOL.com, we will post those changes here 
		so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that 
		information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
==========

		program.
