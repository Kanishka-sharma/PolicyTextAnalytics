This privacy statement explains Ameritrade's practices with respect to the collection and protection of your information and addresses your concerns regarding the disclosure of personal and other information to third parties.
We define "personal information" as any and all of the information specific to you that you personally submit to us over the Internet or any other channel.
This includes your name, address, phone number, birth date, e-mail address and other information you may supply when you open a new account or when you place trades.

When does Ameritrade collect personal information?
When you apply for an Ameritrade account, whether the application is delivered via our Internet site, facsimile, or regular mail, we collect personal information in order to process your application.
After you open your Ameritrade account, our Secure Trading System records your online sessions, including the transactions you conduct online.
==========
When you send us a question or comment via e-mail, we will retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address and our response.
When you use any research products or services from Ameritrade's Quotes & Research Center, the research provider may retain personal information you submitted in the context of using that product or service only.
Personal information is also collected when you voluntarily submit the information in response to a promotion, special offer or other event.

How does Ameritrade use the personal information I provide?
Ameritrade has the highest regard for the privacy of our customers.
Ameritrade will use personal information only as appropriate in the normal course of our business.
Ameritrade may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and contact information and, if applicable, to establish and set up your trading account, issue an account number and a secure password, maintain your portfolio and trading activity, and contact you with account information.
Ameritrade may also use this information to improve our services to you and to inform you about additional products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.
==========
You may be removed from our contact lists for "interest-related" information by sending an e-mail to customerservice@ameritrade.com.
However, we have found that many customers choose to remain on the list since we are careful with both the quantity and quality of the content.
==========
For changes in policy or account critical information, we will contact everyone, usually over multiple channels.

Does Ameritrade share the information collected with any third parties?
It is Ameritrade's policy to keep our customers' personal and financial information confidential.
Ameritrade does not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your individual information to any third party for any reason, except as described below.
We may share personal information with business partners if that information is required to provide the product or service you have requested.
==========
For example, Advanced Clearing, Inc., our clearing firm, needs specific data to process transactions and statements for your account.
All business partners of Ameritrade are required to abide by our policy for using information only as directed by Ameritrade.
==========
To help us improve our services to you, Ameritrade may, from time to time, make our collective customer information available to selected third parties, but only in the aggregate and never with both your password and account number included.
For example, we may provide a third party with summary information culled from our customer database to help us analyze the overall trading patterns of our customers and identify customer needs that we may address.
==========
By use of the website, you agree that we may disclose certain information to third parties.
All third parties with whom we share customer information are required to sign strict nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements.
==========
As our customer, you may have the opportunity to participate in promotions and special offers.
Your participation in certain promotional events may require us to gather and share your personal information.
For example, our Referral Program requires that we provide your name as a reference to prospective customers.
You will always have the choice not to participate in a particular promotion or offer and may contact our Customer Service department to opt out of all such events.
==========
We also reserve the right to disclose your information where required by law to regulatory law enforcement or other government authorities.
We may also disclose your information as necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies or when necessary to protect our rights or property.

Does Ameritrade's policy apply to the sites it links to?
No.
==========
We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and have no control of the use or protection of information provided by you or collected by those sites.

What steps has Ameritrade taken to protect its customers' information?
Ameritrade has invested heavily in a technology infrastructure comprised of expert human and sophisticated technological resources in order to offer you a safe and secure trading environment.
We have taken significant precautions to protect your personal, financial and trading information including the implementation and use of security software, systems, and procedures.
While no security system is absolutely impenetrable, we are constantly reviewing, refining and upgrading our security technology as new tools become available.
==========
When you open an Ameritrade account and use our trading website, you are issued a unique account number and a password by which to access and secure your account and account information.
Only a limited number of employees who have a need to know the information will have access to both your account number and password.
Although we have taken these precautions, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account number and password, which should not be disclosed by you.
On our trading websites, we also use Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt information transmitted by or to you through our website.
And we use VeriSign™ certificates to authenticate our website, allowing you to verify that you are connected to our website.
==========
In order to activate this technology, you need to utilize a browser like Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft® Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher.
We recommend that you choose a browser with strong encryption capabilities.

Privacy Policy Addendum — July 7, 2000

The Ameritrade Privacy Promise:
The trust of our customers is Ameritrade's most precious asset.
==========
Protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal and financial information is one of our highest priorities.
That is why, in addition to the Privacy Policy posted on our website, we are taking this opportunity to further explain how Ameritrade may use portions of your personal information in order to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products and/or services such as we have described here.
If you have any questions this statement does not address, please contact our Customer Service department via e-mail at customerservice@ameritrade.com or call 1-800-454-9272.

What are we going to do with MBNA?
You may have seen our announcement about our strategic relationship with MBNA.
==========
In order to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products and services that MBNA offers, we may provide to a third party the following personal information including name, mailing address, e-mail address, date of birth and employment status.
This information will not be shared with MBNA directly but will be accessed by a third party, direct mail management company that will operate under the specific guidance of Ameritrade.
Your personal information will be destroyed or returned to Ameritrade after this specific use.
As in all our strategic relationships, we require that MBNA identify that the offer is made because of their relationship with Ameritrade.
==========
We may contact you to conduct customer satisfaction surveys.
In order to help us improve our services to you, Ameritrade may make your personal information available to other select non-affiliated third parties to conduct research on our behalf.
==========
For example, we may engage a professional to contact you by e-mail, conventional mail or telephone to conduct customer satisfaction surveys or collect other relevant data that can help us improve our products and services for your benefit.
The type of information provided to these third parties may include identifying information such as name, address and e-mail address and information on account activity.
==========
Again, this information will be used only under the direction of Ameritrade, and will be returned to Ameritrade or destroyed after the intended, specific use.
All your information is protected in a strict confidentiality agreement.
When we share personal information with a third party, we protect that personal information with a strict confidentiality agreement.
Any third parties receiving personal information are required to conform to our privacy standards.
Further, we do not allow non-affiliated parties to retain your personal information any longer than necessary to provide the applicable product, service or information, unless you affirmatively grant us permission to do so.
If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company through a solicitation by Ameritrade (such as a credit card offered by MBNA on the Ameritrade website), any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under Ameritrade's privacy policy, but rather would be subject to the privacy policy of that particular company.
Can I opt out of the sharing or receiving of certain information?
Although Ameritrade may consider it necessary to disclose non-public personal information to non-affiliated third parties in order to service you as we have described, you may direct us not to disclose this information to the companies we have identified above, or contact you with inquiries or information on products or services that you have not specifically requested.
==========
If you want to elect to opt out of participating in these programs and inquiries, send an e-mail to customerservice@ameritrade.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line.
In so doing, you will be identified as a customer whose non-public personal information is not to be shared with a third party and that you do not care to be contacted by us through direct communication for opportunities in other services or inquiry.
==========
Alternatively, you can opt out of the disclosures described above by calling Ameritrade Customer Service at 1-800-454-9272.
NOTE: You cannot opt out of the disclosure of non-public personal information if we need to disclose the information to effect, service, administer or process a transaction, product or service you have authorized or requested; to protect against fraud, liability or damages to property; to respond to judicial process; or in connection with settling a transaction.
