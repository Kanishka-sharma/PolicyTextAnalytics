For more information about how we may use personal data, please read our privacy policy or email dataprotection@theguardian.com.
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device.
It is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive or tablet or mobile device.
==========
When you visit our sites or apps it can allow us to recognise and remember you.
How do we use cookies?
We use cookies in a range of ways to improve your experience on our sites or apps (“site”), including
Keeping you signed in
Understanding how you use our site
Showing you journalism that is relevant to you
Showing you Guardian products and services that are relevant to you
Working with partners to deliver to you relevant advertising
Ultimately, this allows us to publish the journalism that you read on our site.
In the next sections, we explain in more detail how cookies and similar technology on our site may be useful, and when and where you can control them.
First-party and third -party cookies
There are different types of cookies:
First-party cookies – cookies that are set by the Guardian when you use our site
Third-party cookies – cookies that are set by an organisation other than the Guardian when you use our site.
Some Guardian web pages may also contain content from other sites which may set their own cookies.
If you share a link to a Guardian page, the service you share it on may set a cookie on your browser.
What types of cookies do we use?
We use four types of cookies:
Strictly Necessary – cookies that are essential to provide you with services you have requested, which means they cannot be switched off through the privacy settings link.
For example, these include the cookies that make it possible for you to stay logged into your Guardian account and make comments.
==========
If you set your browser to block these cookies, then these functions and services will not work for you.
In particular, we won’t be able to save your preferences about cookies.
Performance - cookies which measure how often you visit our sites and how you use them.
==========
We use this information to get a better sense of how our users engage with our journalism and to improve our sites and apps, so that users have a better experience.
For example, we collect information about which of our pages are most frequently visited, and by which types of users.
==========
We also use third-party cookies to help with performance.
Functionality – cookies that are used to recognise you and remember your preferences or settings when you return to our site, so that we can provide you with a more personalised experience.
For example, if you are based in the United Kingdom, we will remember this and make sure that you receive the UK homepage when you visit our site, rather than the US or Australia homepage.
A mix of first-party and third-party cookies are used.
Advertising – cookies that are used to collect information about your visit to our site, including the content you have viewed, the links you have followed and information about your browser, device and your IP address.
==========
We have set out more details on this below.
How long do cookies last?
Session cookies – cookies that only last as long as your online session, and expire when you close your browser such as Internet Explorer or Safari
Persistent cookies – cookies that stay on your device after your browser has been closed and last for a time specified in the cookie (but not longer than 13 months).
==========
We use these cookies when we need to remember you for more than one browsing session, for instance to remember your preferences from one visit to the next.
Why do we use cookies for advertising?
==========
From the very first edition of the Manchester Guardian, published in 1821, our journalism has been funded in part by advertising.
Our editorial content is not influenced by the advertising we display and our journalists are free to, and often do, challenge the activities of companies and organisations that advertise and sponsor content that appears in Guardian sites and publications.
==========
Increasingly, our readers fund us directly – either by buying a newspaper, or taking out a print or digital subscription or through making one-off, regular or monthly contributions.
But to grow that number of supporters we are reliant on marketing, and we still rely in part on advertising to fund our journalism.
==========
Therefore, cookies provide vital services to the Guardian without sacrificing our independence or values.
How do we use cookies for advertising?
As you browse our site, some of the cookies and similar technology we place on your device are for advertising, so we can understand what sorts of pages you read and are interested in.
We can then display advertising on your browser based on these interests.
For instance, if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles, you may be shown more adverts for food and drink from others.
==========
Our apps integrate third-party software that provides us with information about how the app is used and what content you have viewed for the purposes of online advertising and analytics, in a similar way to our sites.
It uses cookies from some of the providers listed in the Privacy settings, that can be found in the footer of every page on our site.
The advertising techniques we use do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number.
We sometimes use information such as your IP address and browser type and also sometimes share some limited aspects of this with others for advertising purposes.
We also allow other organisations to use cookies and other technology to help us analyse how our site is being used, measure the number of visitors to the site, and display advertising.
To accomplish these goals, Guardian utilises cookies, tags, pixels, and other web beacons to communicate information about you to others.
While some of this information is only used on behalf of the Guardian, we also allow certain selected third parties to use cookies for advertising.
How do third parties use cookies for advertising?
We share and receive online data collected through cookies and similar technology with our advertising partners.
This means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on our sites.
==========
We may also show you advertising on our sites based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.
Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on your browsing patterns and interactions with other sites.
The use of cookies may mean that when you are on another site, you may be shown advertising based on what you have looked at on our sites.
For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products you were browsing.
This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.
==========
Other organisations also collect user information on our sites through cookies, tags and pixels.
Tags and pixels, also known as web beacons, are similar to cookies but are collected through embedded images.
Ozone Project
We are a partner in the Ozone Project that uses cookies, pixels and similar technology to collect information about what you have viewed and how you have used our sites and our app.
==========
They will make assumptions about your interests and preferences and add you to groups based on those assumptions, in order to show you advertising.
For example, if you look at a page in our travel section you might be added to a group for people interested in holidaying abroad, and then we might show you adverts for holidays abroad.
==========
You can find details of how the Ozone Project handles your information here.
Social Media
There are times when we want to reach Guardian readers who use social media to market our own products and services such as our live events and Guardian Jobs.
We use cookies to help with this.
For example, we place a pixel on our web pages that allows Facebook to place cookies on Guardian online readers’ web browsers.
When a Guardian reader who uses Facebook returns to Facebook from our sites, Facebook can identify them as part of a group of Guardian readers and, on behalf of the Guardian, deliver them marketing messages from us.
==========
Based upon our agreements with these other companies, the data that can be obtained from a visit to the Guardian is limited to the URL of the pages that have been visited and, in some cases, the status of any unfinished or completed commercial transactions undertaken with us, together with the limited information a browser might pass on, such as its IP address.
In addition to the cookie controls that are set out below, if you are a Facebook user you can opt out by following this link.
How can you control advertising cookies?
If you are not a California or US resident, you can exercise control over this technology by clicking the Privacy settings link in the footer of every page on our site.
For more information, please read “How to Manage Cookies at the Guardian” below.
==========
If you are a California or US resident, you may elect to opt out of all sales of personal information through these cookies, tags, pixels, and web beacons by clicking the “California resident - Do not sell” link located in the footer of every page on our site or by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” button inside our privacy banner.
How to manage cookies at the Guardian
