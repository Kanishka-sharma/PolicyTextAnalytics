February 1, 2020
 
This Privacy Policy describes how Simplifi Holdings, Inc. (“Simplifi,” “we” or “us”) collects, receives, uses, retains, processes, discloses, transfers, and secures Personal Information through our suite of advertising services (“Advertising Services”).
It also describes your choices regarding use, access, deletion, and correction of your Personal Information.
==========
Our clients, including advertisers or publishers, are referred to in this Policy as “Advertising Customers.”
All references to “you,” “your” or “user” apply to consumers whose Personal Information we collect for our Advertising Services.
For information about our data practices on our website located at http://www.simpli.fi, or our online client portal located at App.simpli.fi, please review our Website Privacy Policy.
==========
“Personal Information,” in this Policy is information about you that is personally identifying, such as your name, email address, or telephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
The definition of Personal Information depends on the laws that apply in your location and may include other types of information as well, such as location data (including precise geo- location data), your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your mobile advertising identifier, or another unique identifier.
This Privacy Policy covers information we collect online only, unless local law requires otherwise.
==========
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically for any changes.
If we make any material changes, we will notify you by means of a notice on this Platform prior to the change becoming effective.
==========
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Simplifi provides its online Advertising Services to Advertising Customers through site retargeting, search retargeting, contextual retargeting, Facebook API, and location-based services including (“GeoFencing”) of Internet users.
These services are generally provided through third-party websites owned and/or operated by our Advertising Customers who publish their own content on the Internet.
We may receive Personal Information such as physical addresses from our Advertising Customers, which we de-identify and use for GeoFencing and to provide analytical reports to our Advertising Customers.
==========
We may also obtain information from third-party data providers, such as physical addresses (including precise geo-location data), information about physical locations of a device over time, and information about consumer characteristics such as demographics and predicted interests.
Through our Advertising Services, we collect information about users’ online activities over time and across non-affiliated web sites, mobile applications, or online services, as applicable, and across multiple devices including connected TVs.
We collect information about your device and your visit(s) to websites, apps, and online services, such as browser type and version, Internet service provider (ISP), mobile operating system, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party, and/or clickstream data.
==========
We also collect information that identifies your devices, which may be considered Personal Information.
This information can include, for example, IP addresses, mobile advertising identifiers, and cookie identifiers.
Simplifi collects Precise Location Data (as defined by the NAI) for your device when, for example, a user makes such information available through a third-party mobile application or webpage on a particular device.
Simplifi may receive this Precise Location Data from third-party partners including Cuebiq.
Simplifi also engages in cross-device linking.
==========
We may combine all of the information that we collect to provide our Advertising Services.
HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION
We use cookies, JavaScript, and similar technologies to provide our Advertising Services.
==========
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the advertising content on our network of third-party sites.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personally identifiable information.
In performing our Advertising Services, we collect information in multiple ways, including:

 on our own websites
 on the websites of publishers or Advertising Customers that call our pixels (or “beacons”),
 when we serve online advertisements, and
 from third party providers

The collection of this data about your online activities across non-affiliated properties and linked devices allows us and our Advertising Customers to better target advertising to user interests.
==========
This process is called interest-based advertising.
The Advertising Services include various analytics and measurement services as well.
==========
The data also allows us to improve our services, for example, improving the effectiveness of the advertisements delivered to users and limiting the number of times a person sees a given advertisement.
INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
We may share the information we collect with other parties for other reasons, including the following:

 We share your Personal Information with our affiliates and third-party vendors who provide services on our behalf.
We can disclose Personal Information to provide our Advertising Services, including disclosures to our Advertising Customers to enable them to serve interest-based advertisements to user devices based on the user’s browsing history and online activities.
==========
Simplifi may also disclose any information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with legal process served on Simplifi, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Simplifi; (3) protect the personal safety of users of Simplifi, its Platform or other services; (4)provide updates and services that may be of interest to the user; or (5) prevent online fraud or other cyber threats, for example through an online threat exchange, or to report, detect and/or prevent security events.
Simplifi is required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
==========
Simplifi may disclose Personal Information with notice or with your consent, as permitted by law.
We may disclose Personal Information with your consent.
SALE OF ASSETS
In the event that Simplifi is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including in bankruptcy, we reserve the right to include, disclose and transfer any or all stored Personal Information and other data among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.
If this occurs, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or material changes in uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

Your Choices
Opting Out of Simplifi Targeted Advertising on Your Browser 
Simpli.fi engages in interest-based advertising activities, including cross-device linking, as described above.
If you would like to stop receiving interest-based advertising from Simplifi on your browser, click here.
By doing so, Simplifi will replace your unique cookie with an “opt-out” cookie that will prevent us from serving you interest-based advertising.
==========
An opt-out choice means that we no longer use or transfer data from the opted out device for targeted advertisements, and we no longer use data collected on other devices to inform advertisements on that device.
We will still collect and store information through such cookies for other purposes such as metrics and analytics and we may still serve you advertising, but it will not be tailored for you.
Because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser or device, you will need to make your opt-out choice on each browser or device that you use.
==========
To do so, point each browser that you use to this page, and click on the disable link above.
Please note that you will need to set the Simplifi opt-out cookie again in some cases, for example, under the following circumstances: You buy a new computer, delete cookies from your browser, or upgrade the browser of your existing computer.
==========

Simplifi makes every effort to ensure adherence to the self-regulatory principles of the DAA and the DAAC.
