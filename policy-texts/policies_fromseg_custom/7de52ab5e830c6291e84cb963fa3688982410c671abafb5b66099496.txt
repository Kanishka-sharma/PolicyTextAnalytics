Forward-Looking Statements
Information or statements provided by Capital One from time to time at the Site or otherwise may contain certain "forward-looking information," including information relating to growth in diluted earnings per share, returns on equity, growth in managed loans outstanding and consumer accounts, net interest margins, funding costs, operations costs and employment growth, marketing expense, delinquencies and charge offs.
Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "goal," "target," "forecast," "project," "continue" or comparable terminology and may involve certain risks or uncertainties and are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements provided below.
==========
The cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Act for any such forward-looking information.
Capital One cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, as they speak only of Capital One's views as of the date the statement was posted at the Site.
==========
Capital One cautions readers that any forward looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially due to various factors, including but not limited to the following: continued intense competition from numerous providers of products and services which compete with Capital One's businesses; with respect to financial products, changes in Capital One's aggregate accounts or consumer loan balances and the growth rate thereof, including changes resulting from factors such as shifting product mix, amount of actual marketing expenses made by Capital One and attrition of accounts and loan balances; an increase in credit losses (including increases due to a worsening of general economic conditions); Capital One's ability to securitize its credit cards and consumer loans and to otherwise access the capital markets at attractive rates and terms to fund its operations and future growth; difficulties or delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of new products or services; losses associated with new products or services; financial, legal, regulatory or other difficulties that may affect investment in, or the overall performance of, a product or business, including changes in existing laws to regulate further the credit card and consumer loan industry and the financial services industry, in general; the amount of, and rate of growth in, Capital One's expenses (including salaries and associate benefits and marketing expenses) as Capital One's business develops or changes or as it expands into new market areas; the availability of capital necessary to fund Capital One's new businesses; the ability of Capital One to build the operational and organizational infrastructure necessary to engage in new businesses or to expand internationally; the ability of Capital One to recruit experienced personnel to assist in the management and operations of new products and services; the ability of Capital One and its suppliers to successfully address Year 2000 compliance issues; and other factors listed from time to time in Capital One's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, Capital One's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997 (Part I, Item 1, Cautionary Statements).
Capital One wishes to caution investors that other factors in the future may prove to be important in affecting Capital One's results of operations.
New factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
