1 day HTTP Cookie     We use statistical cookies and similar techniques to create user profiles on the basis of pseudonyms in order to design our websites to meet the needs of our customers.
==========
For this purpose, information is stored on your terminal device and selected.
Pseudonyms enable individual recognition of users.
However, the natural person behind a pseudonym can regularly not be identified directly, in particular by name, without further, additional data.
In addition, it is possible that we retrieve recognition features for your browser or terminal device (e.g. a so-called browser fingerprint or your unabbreviated IP address) in order to recognize and count returning visitors and to evaluate their interactions pseudonymously.
==========
In the following, we name the statistics cookies and similar techniques, purposes and storage durations as well as third-party providers, if applicable, and provide information on transmission to third countries.
_ga Google Registers a unique ID that is used to generate statistical data on how the visitor uses the website.

==========
Session Pixel Tracker     We use marketing cookies and similar technologies so that you can be shown cross-device targeted advertising on third-party websites and to recognize how effective our advertising measures have been.
When you visit our websites, we or third-party providers used by us may evaluate your IP address, create pseudonymous recognition features for your browser or terminal device (e.g. browser fingerprint), store them there or read them.
These characteristics can be used by providers of tracking services and advertising network operators and other site operators to recognize your terminal device.
We can then order these providers to display advertising for you on other websites, based on the pages you visit on our site.
==========
Furthermore, your interactions with the advertisements placed by us can be tracked.
This makes it possible to track whether you were shown an advertisement placed by us, whether you clicked on it and subsequently visited our websites, and how you subsequently used our websites.
Third-party providers can also exchange and match pseudonymous recognition features (ID) with each other in order to merge the features in the event of a match and assign them to the same user pseudonym (so-called ID matching/syncing).
==========
This allows advertising to be played across different advertising networks.
If you log in to social networks or online services of the third-party provider with your own user data, features can also be linked to your user data.
This enables the third-party provider to control our advertising campaigns in a more targeted and interest-oriented manner.
Below, we list the marketing cookies and similar techniques, purposes and storage durations as well as third-party providers, if applicable, and provide information on the transfer to third countries.

3.4 Google Tag Manager
On our website, we integrate the “Google Tag Manager” of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
==========
In the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), Google Tag Manager is offered as a service by Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows us to integrate and manage additional website content in JavaScript or HTML code.
In particular, so-called tags can be integrated and managed on our website.
Tags are small code fragments or markings (web beacons, tracking pixels or similar markings) that allow services to distinguish or identify users for website analysis or user tracking purposes.
The analysis of website visits or user tracking is not carried out by the Google Tag Manager, but by the services used for these purposes, such as Google Analytics or other third-party solutions.
Rather, the Google Tag Manager merely serves to integrate and manage the tags necessary for analysis or tracking into our website.
Since the Google Tag Manager is provided by Google and is reloaded from its servers when the page is called up, the usage data technically required for calling up the page is also transmitted.
Google also receives your IP address, which is technically required to retrieve the content.
The data processing is based on Art. 6 para.
==========
1 p. 1 lit.
f GDPR.
The purpose and our legitimate interest are to efficiently manage our website content.
Data processing may also take place outside the EU or EEA in third countries.

==========
We, therefore, take measures in accordance with Art. 44 et seq.
GDPR to ensure an adequate level of data protection despite these risks.

On our websites, we integrate the “Google Ads Conversion Tracking” of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
In the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), Google Ads conversion tracking is offered as a service by Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
==========
If an ad placed by us via Google Ads is displayed to you on other websites or if you click on it, these other websites store a Google Ads conversion tracking cookie with a pseudonym assigned to us in your terminal device on the basis of your consent given there.
If you subsequently visit our websites within the storage period of this cookie, this cookie will be read by Google ad conversion tracking on our website.
In this way, Google can determine that you were shown an advertisement placed by us or that you clicked on it and subsequently visited our websites as well as, if applicable, how you subsequently used our websites.
The conversion of an advertisement into action by the website visitor is referred to as a conversion.
From this information, Google Ads creates statistics for us, from which we can see how many users have responded to our advertisements and in what way.
Based on these statistics, we can optimize the effectiveness of our advertising and control our advertising strategy.

In addition, it may happen that we forward your personal data in connection with an inquiry to our company data protection officer, who advises us on all data protection issues and supports us in particular in processing inquiries from data subjects in connection with the assertion of the rights mentioned below.
In each case, the processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para.

4.4 Data processing for the fulfillment of other legal obligations
Finally, we process personal data if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation.
The legal basis for the processing of your data in these cases is Art. 6 para.
==========
1 p. 1 lit.
c GDPR in conjunction with the respective legal norm that imposes such an obligation on us.
==========
If necessary, your data will be transmitted in individual cases to the required extent to auditors, financial or investigative authorities, lawyers, experts or courts.
4.5 Data transfer to independent third parties in the event of company restructuring
For the purpose of and in the interest of preparing and carrying out the sale of individual legal assets of our company or individual parts of our company for the purpose of making a profit, we transfer personal customer data to acquirers.
The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para.

Recipients or categories of recipients of personal data
The recipients of your data as well as data transfers to third countries have already been indicated separately in some cases in the data processing described above.
Furthermore, we may transfer your data to service providers who support us, for example, in the operation of our websites or communication tools used, for example, as hosting or cloud services providers, if the legal data protection requirements are met.
For example, if the data protection requirements are met, we transmit personal data to authorities, such as billing data, if applicable, to tax authorities.
If contracts under data protection law are required for the transfers, we have concluded corresponding contracts with the service providers.
Insofar as data processing may also take place outside the EU or EEA in third countries, there is a risk that authorities in third countries may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal.
==========
We therefore take measures in accordance with Art. 44 et seq.
GDPR to ensure an adequate level of data protection despite these risks, for example by concluding standard contractual clauses with our service providers in conjunction with further technical measures.

==========
Storage period of data
Unless a specific storage period is specified separately for the data processing described above, we process your data as long as this is necessary to achieve the stated purposes or a separately granted declaration of consent to longer storage is available.
We then delete your data from all our operational systems.
==========
We proceed in the same way if, in the case of processing based on the consent granted to us pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit.
a GDPR, you exercise your right of revocation pursuant to Art. 7 (3) GDPR or, in the case of processing based on legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit.
f GDPR, you exercise your right of objection pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR and the conditions stated therein are met.
==========
In particular, insofar as in the event of your objection there are demonstrably compelling grounds for further processing by us that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms as a data subject, this would continue to be permissible.
The same applies if the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims by us.
==========
Insofar as the fulfillment of a legal retention obligation imposed on us precludes deletion, we transfer the data concerned to archives and restrict further processing for the duration of the retention period.
In this case, final deletion will only take place after the retention period has expired.

Voluntariness of the provision of your data
The provision of your personal data is neither legally nor contractually required.
However, in certain cases, it is necessary for you to be able to use the services offered on our websites.
Failure to provide personal data may result in our websites being restricted in their functions or in you not being able to use the services offered.

Your rights
When processing your personal data, the GDPR grants you certain rights as a data subject:
 
8.1 Right of access by the data subject (Art. 15 GDPR)
You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed; if this is the case, you have a right to be informed of this personal data and to receive the information specified in Art. 15 GDPR.
8.2 Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)
You have the right to rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement without delay.
==========
8.3 Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)
You have the right to obtain the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay if one of the reasons listed in Art. 17 GDPR applies.
8.4 Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)
You have the right to request the restriction of processing if one of the conditions listed in Art. 18 GDPR is met, e.g. if you have objected to the processing, for the duration of our examination.
8.5 Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)
In certain cases, which are listed in detail in Art. 20 GDPR, you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or to request that this data be transferred to a third party.
8.6 Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)
If data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 (1) 1 f GDPR (data processing for the purpose of our legitimate interests) or on the basis of Art. 6 (1) 1 e GDPR (data processing for the purpose of protecting public interests or in the exercise of official authority), you have the right to object to the processing at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation.
==========
We will then no longer process the personal data unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or if data is still needed for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
8.7 Right to withdraw consent (Art. 7 GDPR)
If the processing of data is based on your consent, you are entitled to withdraw your consent to the use of your personal data at any time in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR.
==========
Please note that the withdrawal is only effective for the future.
Processing that took place before the withdrawal is not affected.
==========
8.8 Right of complaint to a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)
According to Art. 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection regulations.
This right may be asserted in particular with a supervisory authority in the Member State of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the suspected infringement.
