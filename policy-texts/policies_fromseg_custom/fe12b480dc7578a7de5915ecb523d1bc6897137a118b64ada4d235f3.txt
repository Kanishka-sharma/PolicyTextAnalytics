About AntVoice Services
AntVoice specializes in creating personalized recommendations and advertisements.
We work with online partners to build a personnalized experience and advertisements for users who visit their website or mobile applications and with publishers to display personalized advertisements.
Our aim is to deliver recommendations or advertisements by displaying products and/or personalized banners that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing behavior.
For example, if you visit and browse on Website/mobile application A, you will get personalized recommendation during your browsing session based on the products or contents of your browsing session.
Morover, on a subsequent online visit to Website/mobile application B, you may see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website/mobile application A. With our service, you should receive personalized recommendations and ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without AntVoice.

Our Technology
We collect information via technical cookies placed on your browser.
Thanks to this technology, AntVoice “tags” visitors to its partners’ websites and mobile applications.
Users tagged by AntVoice are given a technical identifier.
At no point does AntVoice collect identifying personal data such as your name or address.
AntVoice only analyses the products or content viewed by the visitor.
Our partners’ advertisements are displayed on many websites, also known as “publishers.”
These publishers may also place cookies on your browser.
These cookies are there so that the publishers recognize that AntVoice has a personalized advertisement available for your browser.
Their use are governed by the specific privacy policies of the publishers which can be accessed directly from their websites.
We may also receive ID-syncing information from trusted partners using diverse linking methods for the same purpose and with the same level of guarantees in terms of Privacy and Data Protection.
We may also store anonymous identifiers inside your browser “local storage” when our technology is used as a recommendation engine provided to media and retailing websites.

Data collection and usage
We do not know who you are.
We only collect and use technical data relating to your browsing navigation to display personalized advertisements.
To serve relevant ads and recommendations, we have to be able to single out patterns but we never willingly store data that would allow identification of a person (such as name, surname, phone number, address, etc.).
We collect data related to your browsing activity through cookies, local storages or advertising IDs that record:
events related to your activity on our partner’s website (such as the number of pages viewed, the products or contents you viewed on that website, your searches made on the partner’s website)
events related to the AntVoice activity such as the number of recommendations or ads displayed to you.

information related to your device (device type, operating system, version)
non-precise information related to your geography and derived from the truncated IP address of your connection.
We do not use or store full IP address for targeting purposes.
These data will be collected to generate Interest-Based Recommendations or advertising.
We also collect technical user identifiers from our partners for the purpose of linking the different browsers and mobile apps you use and serve you relevant recommendations and ads based on your behaviour across environments (“ID syncing”).
For that purpose we process and store
Technical IDs of our partners, or a hashed version of your email address ensuring the non-reversibility of your information.
Mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple IDFA or Google AAID) which are specific technical data created by mobile manufacturers to allow personalization and customer analytics in a secure and non-identifying way for users
