Online Privacy Statement
European Union Data Subjects
What  Are Your Rights Under EU Privacy Law
  We adhere to applicable data protection laws  in the European Union ("EU"), when relevant and appropriate.
==========
If you  are a data subject located in the European Union, this means that:

if we process your personal data  based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time  for further processing;
you have the right to request  access to, rectification or deletion of your personal data;
you have the right to object to  the processing of your personal data;
you have the right to request us  to transfer your personal data to another controller;
you have the right to request us  to restrict the processing of your personal data; and
you have the right to file a  complaint with the Supervisory Authority, in the Member State of your habitual  residence, place of work or where the alleged infringement happened.
The above rights are subject to legal  restrictions, as provided by the applicable EU privacy law.
==========
When we process your personal data, we rely  on specific legal grounds.
When we process your personal data, we do so with  your consent and/or as necessary to provide our services and products, fulfil  our contractual and legal obligations, or other legitimate interests as  described in the sections "About the Information We Collect," "How We Use  Information We Collect" and "What We Share."
==========
You may access, correct or delete some personal  and account information maintained in your Online Account through logging into  your Account Center.
International Data Transfer
We may transfer personal data to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected.
==========
We rely on standard contractual clauses to govern the transfer of information between entities, when and if required.
These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the data.
When we transfer your personal data to the United States, we will protect the data as described in this Privacy Statement.
When your personal data are transferred from  the European Union, it is the responsibility of the data exporter to ensure  that such transfers are done in compliance with EU Privacy Law.
If we were to  be the data exporter, we would put in place appropriate measures for such  transfers to happen in compliance with EU Privacy Law.
==========
