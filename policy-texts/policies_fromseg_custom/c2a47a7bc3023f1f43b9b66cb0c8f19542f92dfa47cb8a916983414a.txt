Cookie Trust Working Group, Inc. dba DigiTrust (“DigiTrust”) is a non-profit, industry-wide collaboration of companies building technology solutions designed to improve the digital experience for consumer, publishers, advertisers and third-parties.
DigiTrust provides an identifier used by participating companies for advertising purposes (“DigiTrust Technology”).
This Privacy Policy explains how DigiTrust may collect, use, and share data with respect to the DigiTrust Technology.
This privacy policy also governs the collection, use, and sharing of data related to our website (http://www.digitru.st).
==========
DigiTrust Technology
When you visit a website that uses DigiTrust Technology, our technology generates a proprietary identifier for your device (the “DigiTrust ID”).
The DigiTrust ID is stored on your browser in the form of either a third party or first party “cookie,” which is a small text file that includes the DigiTrust ID.
For more information about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
==========
Participating companies use the DigiTrust ID for advertising and other purposes, and these companies maintain their own privacy policies and processes.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of companies that use our technology.

Through the DigiTrust Technology, we may collect limited information about the websites you visit where our technology is integrated, in order to operate the service.

Companies who use the DigiTrust Technology may use the DigiTrust ID to engage in their IBA, analytics, identifier syncing, and other advertising related processes.
IBA is advertising that involves the collection of web viewing data across non-affiliated websites over time.
This data is used to infer interests and deliver advertising relevant to those inferred interests.

==========
We keep this information for a maximum of 7 days for operational purposes — to ascertain appropriate company deployments, identify bugs or malicious behavior, and improve our services.
After 7 days, all DigiTrust IDs are removed from the data and the remaining data is aggregated for operational and reporting purposes.
Companies using DigiTrust Technology.
DigiTrust generates the DigiTrust ID for the purpose of providing it to participating companies.
