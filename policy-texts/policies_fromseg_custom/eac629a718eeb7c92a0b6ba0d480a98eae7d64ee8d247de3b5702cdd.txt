Internet Privacy Policy: 

Thank you for visiting the University of Florida.
Our policy is to collect no personally identifiable information 
              about you when you visit our Web sites unless you affirmatively 
              choose to make such information available to us.
However, our Web 
              servers do automatically recognize some non-personal information 
              such as volume and timing of access as well as the Internet domain 
              and IP address from which you accessed our sites.
If you choose to share personal information 
              with us, we will not sell that information to commercial entities.
Some information must be saved for a designated period of time to 
              comply with Florida's records retention policies and may be released 
              if required by the Florida's Public Records Law.
Most student information 
              is kept confidential pursuant to the federal and state Buckley Amendments.
If you have questions about our privacy policy, 
              or have ideas about improving our policy, please feel free to e-mail 
              us at webadmin@aa.ufl.edu.
Or you can reach us by telephone at (352) 
              392-3753.
For information concerning privacy for students, faculty and staff, 
              please see the University's Acceptable Use Policy at http://www.it.ufl.edu/policies/aupolicy.html.
