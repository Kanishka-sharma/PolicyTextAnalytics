Symantec takes safeguarding online privacy seriously.
Please read the following to understand Symantec's privacy practices.
From time to time, Symantec may need to change its privacy statement because of changes in its business, or in its attempts to serve your needs better.

What information does Symantec gather?
There are times when Symantec may need to gather specific information from you such as your name and address, among other personal information.
Information that is essential for Symantec to provide the services and/or products that are requested by you is generally designated as "Required".
Additional information that would allow Symantec flexibility in providing its services or products, and may be used for internal statistical studies or market research, is generally indicated as "Optional".
For example, a credit card number is required when ordering a product, whereas a fax number may not be essential, but would provide another means of communication between you and Symantec.
The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to Symantec is completely at your discretion.
==========
It is never mandatory for you to answer any question, although it may limit the services and products that Symantec is able to offer.
How does Symantec use personal information?
==========
When you submit personal information to Symantec, you understand that you are agreeing to allow Symantec, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, access to, storage of, and use of, the data in any of the countries where Symantec, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, do business, whether inside or outside of the United States.
Symantec may use the personal information you submit for any purposes related to Symantec's business, including, but not limited to, generating statistical studies, conducting market research, improving its products and services, sending you surveys, and notifying you of product upgrades and updates, new products, special offers, seminars and conventions and any other changes within Symantec that may affect you.
