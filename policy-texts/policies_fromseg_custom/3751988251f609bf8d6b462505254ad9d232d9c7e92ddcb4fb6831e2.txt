Resumes/CVs (referred to simply as "resumes" following)
On ScienceCareers.org, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database.
There are two ways of doing this:
You can post your resume in our database on a confidential basis and choose who sees the resume.
You will be notified via e-mail and asked if you want to release your resume to a specified organization.
However, even if a resume is confidential, some elements of it may be viewed.
==========
If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume.
We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database.
We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database.
You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.
Please Note: It is not our practice to restrict access to our resume database to any particular customer(s).
==========
Please be advised that your current employer or an entity affiliated with your current employer might be a customer of the ScienceCareers.org sites.
We are not responsible for any actions or results that may occur as a result of any customer's access to and/or use of your resume.
