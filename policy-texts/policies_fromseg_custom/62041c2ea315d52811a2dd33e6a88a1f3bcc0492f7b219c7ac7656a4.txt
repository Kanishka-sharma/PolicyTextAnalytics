CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Some portions of the About Web site may be used by children under the age of 13.
About is strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of children who visit our Web site.
About has a system in place to effectively screen its users to ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).
COPPA and its accompanying regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet.
Our site and services may collect information about children under 13, including e-mail forum participation and chat rooms.
==========
Use of such activities requires initial registration by the participant.
Children under 13 who wish to register are asked to have a parent or legal guardian do so for them.
The parent must provide a credit card number for verification that he/she is an adult.
Upon verification, the parent can choose in which activities he or she would like the child to participate.
Parents can change the selected activities at any time.
Only after  verifying age in accordance with Federal standards, do we collect and maintain the name, date of birth and email address of children who register.
With proper proof of identification (including name and credit card verification), parents can review their child's personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child's information.
==========
We use cookies to check the age of registered users who enter chat rooms.
We do not knowingly permit users under 13 into chat rooms unless their parents have consented to their participation.
About.com includes many topical areas that all users may access.
When a parent provides verifiable consent to allow his or her child to use chat and forums and to receive newsletters or other materials where a child may provide personally identifiable information, the child will also have access to those relevant services throughout the About site, including areas that may not be directed toward children.
In particular, if you allow your child to participate in chat or forums, your child will have access to all chat and forum areas on About.com.
Many chat areas are not monitored and private chat is permitted.
Chat areas may contain information or language unsuitable for young children and visitors of all ages may participate.
If you authorize your child to participate in these features, we encourage you to monitor their use closely.
We also allow guests to participate in chat and forum areas at About.com but use techniques to prevent unregistered children under 13 from participating in areas unsuitable for them.
==========
Parents can change these options at any time.
Except as authorized under COPPA, About.com will NOT:
collect online contact information from a user under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent, which includes an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity.
When we do not obtain prior verifiable parental consent, online contact information will be used only to directly respond to the child's request and will not be used to contact the child for other purposes.collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from children known to be under 13.
give the ability to children to participate in forums or chat rooms without prior verifiable parental consent.entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity.
We will also place prominent notice wherever personally identifiable information is collected requesting the child to ask a parent for permission to proceed.
