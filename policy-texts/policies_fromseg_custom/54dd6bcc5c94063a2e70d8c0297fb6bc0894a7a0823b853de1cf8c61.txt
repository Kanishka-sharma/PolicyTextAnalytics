Evidon™ helps you understand how companies collect and use your data—often to target ads to you—and gives you the ability to opt out of targeting if you wish.
Evidon has nothing to do with the serving of the ad itself or collecting the data that was used in the ad.

Ghostery is a browser add-on that protects your privacy online.
Ghostery reveals the companies that are tracking you when you visit a website, allows you to learn more about those companies and, if you choose to, prevent those companies from collecting your browser data.
Ghostery is free to download, free to use, and does not contain any adware or spyware.
It's the only privacy tool of its kind that is available for all major browsers — Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer.
