    OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM OUR PARTNERS ARE ALL SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY.
==========
YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR YOUR SUBMISSION TO US OF A REGISTRATION FORM FOR A FREE CREDIT SCORE, RELATED ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION IN CONNECTION THEREWITH AND ENROLLMENT IN 
    THE VALUABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFER PROGRAM CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT TO ABIDE BY EACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF

    THEREWITH AND FOR PARTICIPATION IN OUR VALUABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFER PROGRAM.
User Agreement
The following are terms of a legal agreement (the "Agreement") between you and Credit Karma, Inc., a Delaware corporation  ("Credit Karma", "we", or "us"),
    that sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of this web site (the "Site").
The Site is owned and operated by Credit Karma.
==========
This Site is being provided to you expressly subject to this Agreement.
By accessing, browsing, and/or using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
The terms and conditions of this Agreement form an essential basis of our bargain.
==========
We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time and will notify you of any such changes by posting the revised Agreement on the Site.
You should check this Agreement periodically for changes.
All changes shall be effective upon posting.
Your continued use of the Site after any change to this Agreement
    constitutes your agreement to be bound by any such changes.
We may terminate, suspend, change, or restrict access to all or any part of this Site without notice or liability.
==========
Through the Site, you may register to receive a free credit score, related analysis of information in connection therewith and valuable offers for products and services from time to time from our partners  (collectively, the "Partners").
As set forth in more detail in our  privacy policy,
    we will not share your credit report and score with our Partners.
However, we will match those offers against your Registration Profile (as hereinafter defined), which would include your credit report and score along with other targeting criteria,
    in order to ensure that you receive offers that are tailored to you.
One of the underlying philosophies behind our business, as reflected in the "Credit Karma" name,
    is that individuals who have through their efforts been able to maintain relatively good credit scores or who have worked hard to re-build their credit should be able to reap the rewards of those efforts,
    including by receiving discounted and favorable pricing and rates on the products and services that they enjoy.
==========
While we do not guarantee that the offers that you receive from our Partners will meet that goal,
    or that they will necessarily be the best offers available to you, we do represent and warrant to you that providing you with valuable offers for products and services from our Partners is
    one of the main animating objectives of our business.
Our technology for matching your registration profile to the valuable offers for products and services provided by our Partners is proprietary and,
    in carrying out such matching, we may elect to consider, ignore, emphasize, or de-emphasize any relevant factors in our sole discretion.
We do not guarantee that you will receive offers
    for any particular types of products or services.
==========
Right to Receive Your Credit Report
In addition to the free credit score you will receive from Credit Karma, you are allowed to receive one free credit report under the FCRA from each of the three national credit reporting agencies
    (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) during any twelve-month period.
You may also be able to receive free credit reports as permitted by state law (you may contact your state or local consumer protection
    agency or state attorney general to learn more about your rights under state law).
For information on obtaining a free credit report from Experian, Equifax or TransUnion you may contact them directly at www.experian.com, www.equifax.com and www.transunion.com.
Obligation to Provide Accurate and Complete Information Where Required
In consideration of your use of the materials on this Site including, without limitation, the text, data, articles, design, source code, software, photos, images, and other information (collectively, the "Content")
    ") or your submission to us of a registration form to receive your credit score for free, related analysis of information in connection therewith and, if you so choose, to participate in our valuable products and services offer program (collectively, the "Product"),
    you agree to provide true, accurate, and current information about yourself when prompted to do so by this Site or by the registration form.

I understand that by submitting this registration form I am requesting a copy of my consumer credit report and score; such submission shall therefore constitute "written instructions" in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act for Credit Karma to obtain a copy of my consumer credit report and score from a consumer reporting agency.
I further authorize Experian, TransUnion and/or Equifax to provide a copy of my consumer credit report and score to Credit Karma, Inc. at 115 Sansome Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94104.
I further understand that by submitting this registration form I am authorizing Credit Karma, once it has obtained my credit report and score for me, to retain a copy of such credit report and score in its records along with the other information I am submitting through this registration form (collectively, the "Registration Profile"),  to use that Registration Profile to match me with product and services offers from time to time from its marketing partners, which offers it will send to me either by e-mail (only if I opt-in via email preferences) or through the display of advertisements and to further use that Registration Profile to provide statistical analysis, reports and summaries of my Registration Profile in comparison to other users’ Registration Profiles.
I understand that Credit Karma will not be sharing my Registration Profile with any of those marketing partners and that it is completely up to me to decide whether I would like to accept any of the offers I receive, in which case I would deal directly with the marketing partners at issue.
