Sometimes this information comes from lists like the telephone book.
==========
When a consumer applies to be our customer, we collect the information given during the application process (such as the consumer's name, address, telephone number and date of birth).
Customers.
When you are a customer, we collect and store information to help us verify the effectiveness of our products and services, to monitor your usage and to better tailor our services to your needs and interests.

We want you to understand why we collect and use information about you and how this can benefit you.
==========
By knowing more about our customers, we and our business partners can provide specialized products that may be of interest to you and your family.
We collect and use information about consumers and customers so we or our service vendors (whether engaged by or on behalf of us or any of our assignees) can use it in the following ways:

to open, maintain, service, process, analyze, survey, audit and collect on your account;
to verify your identity and credit worthiness;
to protect you from identity theft, fraud and unauthorized access to your account;
to share application and transaction information with consumer reporting agencies and other parties who have financial, employment or business dealings with you;
to determine your eligibility, administer and contact you for the purposes of marketing, promotions, rewards programs, research or contests; and
to use for any purpose required by law.
This information may also be shared with any person or entity to which we have assigned or transferred an interest in your account, any debt or interest due or any of our rights or obligations under any agreement with you (including any subsequent assignee).
We may also use your information to respond to your questions or to contact you in order to notify you of functional changes to our Web site or to our products and services.

If you choose to contact us, we may retain your e-mail address, the content of your communication and our response.
We may contact you by e-mail using the e-mail address you provided for special offers or standard service messages.
To ensure your security, we will not include sensitive information in an e-mail such as your full 16-digit account number, date of birth, Social Insurance Number (if provided) or account balance.

Contacting You
Capital One and any assignees may use any method to contact you (including mail, phone, e-mail) using your contact information unless you have opted out of a particular channel.
Even when you have opted out, we may still be required to contact you when legal reasons (for example, we may use mail to send you disclosures) or business needs (for example, to alert you if there has been fraud on your account) override the conditions of the opt-out.
