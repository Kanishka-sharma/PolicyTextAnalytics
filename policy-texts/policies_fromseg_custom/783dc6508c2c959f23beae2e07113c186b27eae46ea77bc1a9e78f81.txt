CHILDREN'S

      PRIVACY 
 




Procter

      & Gamble believes that it's especially important to protect children's privacy

      online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their

      children to participate and monitor their Internet activity.
Procter & Gamble

        respects all applicable national and international children's privacy

        regulations.
Procter & Gamble does not intend to

      collect personal information from children, except on some of our children's websites,

      in which case we will collect such information in accordance with local laws and regulations

      on children's privacy.
If we collect personal information from children,

      we ask only for the information necessary

      to participate in the program for which the child is registering.
Where appropriate,

        Procter & Gamble will specifically instruct children not to submit such

        information on our websites and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure

        parental consent to such submission.
==========
For instance, we may ask for a visitor's

        age, birthday, or birth year in order to determine whether or not the

        visitor is a child.
If the birthday or birth year entry reveals a child

        is under the age limit as defined by the applicable local or national

        law, we will not allow the child to continue without the guardian's consent.
==========
If a child has provided us with personal information, a parent or guardian

        of that child may contact us at the email address or address listed at

        the bottom of this Privacy Statement if they would like this information

        deleted from our records.
We will use reasonable efforts to delete the

        child's information from our databases.
==========
We do not filter advertisements

        or other content that children may view through our sites, and they could

        receive content and materials from the Internet and/or advertising that

        are inappropriate for children.
If you would like

        to contact us about your or your child's personal information, or to find

        out how you can have your child's personal information removed from our

        database, please see the Access To Your Information

        and Complaints section later in this document.
