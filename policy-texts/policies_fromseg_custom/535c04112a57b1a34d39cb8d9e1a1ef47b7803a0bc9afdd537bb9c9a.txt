Security
FIFA wants you to feel confident about using the FIFA Digital Platforms.
For this reason, FIFA has implemented adequate technical and organisational measures designed to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure.
However, FIFA cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties might maliciously access your personal data.
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to FIFA.
Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.
==========
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication.
FIFA has implemented procedures to be able to react in case of unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure of personal data.
==========
If you suspect that such an incident has occurred, please get in touch with FIFA via dataprotection@fifa.org.
If you communicate with FIFA by email, please note that the secrecy of internet email is uncertain.
By sending sensitive or confidential email messages or information which are not encrypted, you are accepting the risk of a possible lack of confidentiality over the internet.

FIFA will ensure that your personal data is deleted if there are no legal reasons obliging FIFA to keep your personal data.
Links to other sites
If any part of the FIFA Digital Platforms links to other websites external to FIFA, those websites do not operate under this Data Protection Policy.
==========
If you choose to visit an advertiser or click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.
FIFA does not exercise control over third-party websites and therefore recommends that you read and understand the data protection policies posted on these other websites to understand their procedures for processing, collecting, using and disclosing personal data.
Our policy towards children
FIFA does not on purpose process personal data from children under 16.

Where children under 16 use FIFA’s Digital Platforms, we advise that they obtain the permission of a parent or legal guardian, and FIFA recommends that parents or legal guardians clear their browser cache of cookies and take all other steps highlighted in this Data Protection Policy to minimise the personal data collected.
When FIFA becomes aware that a child under 16 has provided FIFA with personal data without such permission, FIFA will delete such personal data.
