View summary of recent updates Return to Terms of Service
Below is a high level summary of the recent material changes we've made to our Terms of Service, but please be sure to read the Terms of Service in its entirety as that constitutes the binding agreement governing your use of the Services:
January 4, 2012
As we expand across the globe and create new Eventbrite domains, we wanted to clarify that the websites we are referring to in Section 1.1(a) of the Terms of Service includes all Eventbrite websites and domains.
As we expand our product offerings to mobile apps such as At The Door™, Entry Manager and the Eventbrite app, we wanted to clarify in Section 3.2 of the Terms of Service that these new offerings are a part of our Services.
We added a description to Section 4.4(c) of the required reporting that the IRS is mandating under the new 1099-K regulations.
We have clarified in Section 6 of the Terms of Service that Eventbrite is the sole and final arbiter of account ownership disputes.
==========
Many of our customers have expressed their desire to use our Services to run raffles, contests and sweepstakes in compliance with applicable laws.
So we have removed our flat prohibition on raffles, contests and sweepstakes in Section 7.2 and Section 8.1 of the Terms of Service and replaced it with required guidelines, which if followed, will allow a customer organizing a raffle, contest or sweepstakes on our Services to do so.
We updated the address and contact information of our DMCA agent in Section 7.3 of the Terms of Service.
February 1, 2012
We added a new Section 1.3 that covers translations to our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and other documents on the Eventbrite Site.
March 28, 2012
We clarified the terms of our Organizer Referral Program in Section 10.1 of our Terms of Service Agreement (Organizers) and Section 9.1 of our Terms of Service Agreement (Buyers and Other Non-Organizers).
We've clarified in Section 8.1 that we no longer allow Content relating to the sale or provision of goods and services unrelated to events listed on the Eventbrite Site.
July 25, 2012
Eventbrite can now be used for more than just selling tickets and registrations!
We now give our Organizers the ability to sell merchandise in connection with their tickets and registrations.
==========
So we have broadened some of the language throughout the Terms of Service to cover the sale of merchandise.
We've changed our fee language throughout the Site to make it more consistent and clear.
This required certain changes throughout the Terms of Service.
==========
We've removed language with respect to bank account transfers as a permissible means of payment.
Eventbrite hopes to offer direct debit payment options in the future, but for now we found this language to be confusing to our customers.
We've streamlined the content licenses in Section 7.1 and 7.2 of the Terms of Service to make them clearer and less repetitive.
==========

PAYMENT METHODS.
==========
4.1 Overview.
There are two types of payment processing options Organizers may elect when using the Services: (1) "Facilitated Payment Processing" or "FPP", which consists of collecting Event Registration Fees using FPMs; and (2) "Credit Card Processing" or "CCP", which requires the use of the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees.
Depending on the payment processing option the Organizer elects when using the Services, monetary payments will be made to the Organizer directly by Buyers (via FPP) or by EVENTBRITE (via CCP), in each case as described below.
4.2 Facilitated Payment Processing.
==========
(a) Independent Relationship.
When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.
(b) Services Fees.
Organizers will collect all monies directly from Buyers under the FPP option.
By registering for and using the FPP option, you agree to (i) pay EVENTBRITE all then-applicable Eventbrite Service Fees and Credit Card Processing Fees, which are based on the number of tickets sold by you and/or the value of such tickets, and which charges are described in greater detail at www.eventbrite.com/fees, and all additional on-site service fees, equipment lease charges, printed ticket fees, and any other fees and charges of any kind payable by you to EVENTBRITE in connection with the provision of the Services (collectively, "Service Fees"), which payments shall be due and payable upon receipt of the invoice setting forth such charges; and (ii) accept the responsibility for providing refunds to Buyers at your own discretion.
EVENTBRITE will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify EVENTBRITE and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the FPP option.
Invoices are sent monthly for Service Fees incurred in the previous month.
==========
4.3 Credit Card Processing.
(a) Gateway; Payment Process.
When an Organizer elects to use the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees, payment processing occurs directly through EVENTBRITE.
Under the CCP option, EVENTBRITE will collect all Event Registration Fees on behalf of the Organizer from Buyers and deduct all applicable Services Fees from the Event Registration Fees collected by EVENTBRITE, and then pass the remainder along to the Organizer within five (5) business days after the event end date for the event to which the Event Registration Fees correspond (either by mailing a check or through an electronic funds transfer, depending on the option the Organizer has chosen through using the Site, to the address or account, respectively, that the Organizer accurately designates on the Site), provided that EVENTBRITE reserves the right to withhold funds (i) at any time as EVENTBRITE determines to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, and other discrepancies and (ii) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this TOS.
EVENTBRITE, in its sole discretion, may determine to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Organizer prior to the period set forth above, on such terms and conditions as EVENTBRITE may establish from time to time.
Organizer agrees that all Event Registration Fees for a given event are earned by Organizer only following conclusion of the applicable event and all Event Registration Fees ultimately due will be net of all Service Fees, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and other deductions, whether due to customer complaints, allegations of fraud, discrepancies related to the applicable event or otherwise.
==========
No payments shall be made to an Organizer from EVENTBRITE with respect to any event that is cancelled.
If payments have already been made by EVENTBRITE to an Organizer for a cancelled event, such Organizer will immediately refund to EVENTBRITE all such payments upon cancellation of such event.
All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars, or other foreign currencies accepted by EVENTBRITE.
If Organizer elects to list Event Registration Fees in a foreign currency accepted by EVENTBRITE, EVENTBRITE will collect and disperse the funds in the foreign currency selected by Organizer.
ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ANY PAYMENT BY EVENTBRITE OF EVENT REGISTRATION FEES PRIOR TO THE FIFTH (5TH) BUSINESS DAY AFTER THE END DATE OF THE APPLICABLE EVENT ARE MERELY ADVANCES OF AMOUNTS THAT MAY BECOME DUE TO ORGANIZER UNDER THIS TOS AND THAT EVENTBRITE MAY DEMAND SUCH ADVANCES BACK (FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION), AND ORGANIZER SHALL THEREUPON PROMPTLY (AND IN ANY CASE WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER SUCH DEMAND) PAY BACK TO EVENTBRITE SUCH ADVANCE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF DEMANDED BY EVENTBRITE.
==========
(b) Refunds.
(i) Under the CCP option, it is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Buyers and to issue refunds to Buyers via the Site.
An Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this TOS and the payment and refund mechanics of the Site.
The Site permits an Organizer to issue refunds to Buyers, provided the refund is issued by Organizer before ninety-six (96) hours after the end date of an event and within six (6) months after the transaction date for the underlying ticket purchase.
Refunds issued following such period will not be processed through the Site, unless otherwise agreed to by EVENTBRITE in its sole discretion.
Subject to the foregoing, refunds issued by an Organizer will be processed within thirty (30) days after Organizer instructs the issuance of the refunds via the Site.
==========
All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Buyer, and EVENTBRITE will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify EVENTBRITE and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the CCP option.
(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that EVENTBRITE shall have the right to force a refund of any or all tickets at any time for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if EVENTBRITE receives complaints from a substantial number (as determined by EVENTBRITE in its sole discretion) of Buyers with respect to the applicable event or another event held by Organizer, or EVENTBRITE determines in its sole discretion that Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations.
Further, if one or more Buyer(s) request a refund, whether due to a cancelled event or for any other reason where EVENTBRITE would reasonably expect to lose a chargeback, EVENTBRITE may, in its sole discretion, issue such refund to such Buyer(s), and Organizer shall then owe the amount of such refund to EVENTBRITE.
==========
(c) Credit Card Chargebacks.
Under the CCP option, any credit card chargebacks initiated by a Buyer for any reason with respect to an event shall be charged back to the Organizer of such event.
All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between the Organizer and Buyer, and EVENTBRITE will not be responsible or liable in any way for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify EVENTBRITE and its affiliates for, chargebacks issued in the course of the use of the CCP option.
==========
4.4 Non-Exclusive Remedies.
(a) Payment.
In the event that Organizer fails to pay to EVENTBRITE any amount owed pursuant to this TOS when due, such amount shall bear interest calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) ten percent (10%) per annum, and (b) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.
In the event any amounts are owed by Organizer to EVENTBRITE under this TOS or otherwise, EVENTBRITE may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, (i) deduct such amounts from Organizer's outstanding balance, whether for that particular event or for any other event that Organizer lists through the Services; and/or (ii) send an invoice to Organizer for such amounts to the extent Organizer's outstanding balance is insufficient to cover these costs, in which case Organizer shall pay EVENTBRITE such invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice.
If payment for any amounts due to EVENTBRITE hereunder are not made by Organizer when due, EVENTBRITE reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, to terminate Organizer's registration for the Services (including any and all accounts that Organizer may have) and to cancel all other events listed by Organizer.
==========
(b) Confirmation.
Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual ticket purchase, EVENTBRITE generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number.
You agree to unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all ticketing commitments that have been confirmed by EVENTBRITE through the Services, and it is your responsibility to verify the Buyer's membership status, confirmation number and/or any event restrictions prior to the subject event.
==========
(c) Taxes; Withholding.
You are responsible for (and will indemnify EVENTBRITE and its affiliates against) all taxes associated with your activities on the Services (excepting taxes based on EVENTBRITE'S net income), which amounts may be withheld from payments due to you or invoiced to you.
In addition, if in a given calendar year EVENTBRITE processes transactions for your account (i) for more than $20,000 in gross sales and (ii) in more than 200 order transactions, EVENTBRITE is required to report those transactions to the Internal Revenue Service, along with your name, address and Tax Identification Number.
==========
EVENTBRITE will contact you during the year for this information if you meet these thresholds.
EVENTBRITE reserves the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to you hereunder if (i) EVENTBRITE suspects or determines that such amounts have been generated in (A) a fraudulent manner, (B) violation of this TOS, or (C) violation of any applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic), or (ii) EVENTBRITE is required to do so by applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic).
Such withholding may be temporary or permanent (as determined by EVENTBRITE).
