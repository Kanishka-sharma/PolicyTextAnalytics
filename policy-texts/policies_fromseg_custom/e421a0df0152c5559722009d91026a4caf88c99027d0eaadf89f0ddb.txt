Your Privacy
Welcome!
At Dotomi, we take privacy seriously  because we are proud to be a leader in the field of internet advertising and a  true innovator in the way people, including ourselves, buy the things we  need.
Our privacy policy is aimed to clarify what information we collect,  how we safeguard it, and when we use it to provide relevant advertising about  products of interest.
The effective date of this privacy policy is June 8,  2009.
==========
Dotomi was founded with the basic principle of empowering  consumers with control to drive relevant advertising.
This foundation  includes the belief that each consumer’s private information should be  protected.
Our success, in part, comes from our ability to achieve two  basic consumer needs in a holistic fashion:  

Preserve every consumer’s right to receive  personalized advertising; and
Respect every consumer’s privacy by not  utilizing personally-identifiable information to determine what products and  services are of interest to them.
Dotomi’s team is comprised of industry leaders that have  been involved in internet advertising and consumer privacy from the very  beginning of the online space.
This experience has helped us forge a  business around one central belief: it is possible to provide each  individual consumer with the privacy they deserve, while giving them access to  valuable information about products and services that interest them.
==========
Scope of Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Dotomi’s online method of  collection and use of anonymous information gathered by us for this website and  clients that we serve.
This Privacy  Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of our clients.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
How does Dotomi provide consumers relevant  advertising?
We partner with Marketing companies (“Marketing Partners”) whose Privacy Policy  allows them to share anonymous information about their customers and/or  inquirers as well as information about a consumer’s interests and/or purchase  behavior.
All Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is rendered  anonymous for our services.
We will not and do not accept any credit card  numbers or Social Security numbers from any Marketing Partner.
==========
The combined Marketing Partner information provided  allows us to analyze and understand more about the things consumers are or  might be interested in, allowing Dotomi to replace advertisements with ones  more relevant to the consumer.

How does Dotomi  find consumers on the web?
When a consumer visits our website or one of our Marketing Partner’s websites a  “cookie” or “pixel tag” may placed on the consumer’s machine.
Information  collected from cookies or pixel tags are not linked to PII.
No PII is transferred in the Dotomi cookie or  pixel tag.
Dotomi only knows that consumer by an anonymous ID, so that we  can replace non-relevant ads with ads that are more relevant to the consumer’s  interests.
Again, we don’t know who the consumer is, we just know the  consumer’s preferences through that ID.

What is a “Cookie” or  “Pixel Tag”?
A cookie is an industry-standard small data file placed on a consumer’s  computer.
Cookies allow marketers to “remember you” when you return to  their website.
Again, no PII is transferred in the Dotomi cookie.
Consumers have the capability of deleting cookies on their machine; however, if  they enjoy the convenience of a website remembering them, consumers are advised  not to delete their cookies.
This website contains, in addition to Dotomi  cookies, other third party cookies that assist us in supplying information that  will make it easier for you to navigate on our site.
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon) is an  industry-standard, often-transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1  pixel that is placed in a website or e-mail.
Again, no PII is transferred  in this pixel tag.
==========
This allows a marketer to understand what products or  services a consumer - as a “user” - may be interested in based on their actions  on a Marketing Partner’s website or within an e-mail.
Dotomi cookies and  pixel tags do not track the consumer outside this site or of the Marketing  Partners websites or e-mail unless it is to display an advertisement.
