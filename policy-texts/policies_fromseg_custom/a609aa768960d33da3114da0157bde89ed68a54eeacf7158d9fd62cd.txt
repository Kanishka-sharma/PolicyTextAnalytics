Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
Once the user has closed the browser the cookie will no longer be accessed during that session.IP Address: When your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information.
This is called your computer's "IP address."

(IP stands for "Internet protocol.")
For many users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time you log on.
