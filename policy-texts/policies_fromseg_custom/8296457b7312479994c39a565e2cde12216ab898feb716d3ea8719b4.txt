Privacy Notice
For those who view or post
LandAndFarm.com listings:
Internet user privacy and confidentiality
is of the utmost importance to LandAndFarm.com, our registered
listing partners, and our advertisers.
Our reputation and integrity
is directly related to how we serve our clients, customers and
visitors.
Below, please find below a description of how LandAndFarm.com
strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain
the Internet as a highly credible medium for all to enjoy.
User Information (Searching)
All users who view listings
on LandAndFarm.com retain complete anonymity where LandAndFarm.com
is concerned.
As the listings appear in your web browser, LandAndFarm.com
does not acquire or collect any personal information about you.
Registration Information (Listing)
LandAndFarm.com
regards all personal information collected from its registered partners
and customers as confidential, except for those items that appear in
the listings, such as Name, Address, Email Address, Phone Numbers and
all property data and all other data that is available to public
viewers of the web site.
All other personal data provided during
registration processes and financial account information (credit card /
bank information) is kept strictly private.
LandAndFarm.com does
forward certain property listings to third parties as part of marketing
agreements LandAndFarm has with those third parties.
LandAndFarm does
not sell its customer lists or information in the listings to mass
marketing entities, though it reserves the right to do so, with the
understanding that we will inform our users of any such agreement on
our web site and in our newsletter.
As of the date of this notice
(8/2001) no such agreements exist.
