Privacy
TheList.com provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of TheList's website, located at the domain TheList.com (the "TheList Website").
Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the TheList Website.
Information Collection and Use
It is not necessary to provide TheList with your personally identifiable information to use the TheList Website, and TheList does not collect personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the TheList Website.
If you contact TheList by email through the TheList Website, TheList may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to TheList in your message, to respond to you.
TheList treats this information as it would treat any other unsolicited business correspondence, and has no obligation to keep this information confidential, nor to take any security measures to protect this information.
When you visit the TheList Website, TheList's servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data").
This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting.
For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on.
==========
TheList uses Log Data to monitor use of the TheList Website and the services we offer via the TheList Website and for the TheList Website's technical administration.
Cookies
Like many websites, TheList also uses "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the TheList Website and the services offered via the Web Site.
A cookie is a small data file that TheList's servers transfer to your computer's hard disk.
TheList does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information.
However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies.
==========
TheList mainly uses "session cookies", which enable certain features of the TheList Website and services offered via the TheList Website, to better understand how you interact with the Web Site and services we offer via the TheList Website, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the TheList Website, and to improve the TheList Website and services offered via the TheList Website.
Session cookies should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the TheList Website.
TheList also uses a persistent cookie that stays on your computer after you leave the TheList Website, for the sole purpose of ensuring that you receive a variety of TheList content (also called "frequency-capping").
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.
You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
==========
Information Sharing and Disclosure
TheList cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties, to enforce and comply with the law.
TheList may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as TheList, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of TheList or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
If any or all of the assets of TheList are acquired by, or merged with another entity, TheList will share with this entity some or all of the information collected through the TheList Website.
Security
Because TheList does not collect any personally identifiable information from the TheList Website, TheList does not take any specific security measures to protect the information we do collect.
Links to Other Sites
The TheList Website may contain links to other web sites ("Linked Sites") operated by TheList or third parties.
Linked Sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
==========
This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that TheList collects through the TheList Website.
Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
TheList does not exercise control over third party Linked Sites.
Your use of any Linked Site operated by TheList is subject to the terms and conditions provided by TheList for such Linked Site.
TheList encourages you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
Our Policy Towards Children
The TheList Website is not directed to children under 18.
==========
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided TheList with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact TheList at info@TheList.com.
If TheList becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided TheList with personally identifiable information, TheList will remove such information from our files.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
TheList reserves the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice.
