What information does Citrix Online gather/track and how is it used?
PERSONAL INFORMATION: We collect personal information from users including (at minimum) first and last names, an email address to be used as a login, billing contact information, credit card number and a password.
When a user registers online for a free trial of the service, Citrix Online will take steps to validate the credit card and billing information supplied to us to ensure it is accurate.
We also use this information to determine your eligibility for our one-time free trial offer.
==========
Your email address may be used to send you periodic product newsletters, offers and usage tips from Citrix Online.
You can opt out of promotional emails at any time, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to you.
We use the information collected to deliver services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and services, and generally maintain your accounts with us.
==========
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at customercare@citrixonline.com.
We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy.
==========
Information gathered at either www.citrixonline.com, www.videoconferencing.com or on www.workshifting.com is done so on a voluntary basis.
You need not provide us with any personal information to use these sites.
Information submitted on these sites can include contact information such as email addresses, comments on blog postings and job and press inquires.
You should be aware that any information you provide in the comment or blog areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
To request removal of your personal information from these areas, contact us at customercare@citrixonline.com.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
==========
In-session information collected during meeting, webinar and training sessions is protected by the use of end-to-end encryption and only accessible by the authorized users, organizers and participants.
“In-session information” includes all screen sharing data, keyboard/mouse control data and text chat information.
==========
This information is never exposed in unencrypted form while temporarily resident within Citrix Online’s communication infrastructure servers or during transmission across public or private networks.
Information about scheduled and prior meetings, webinars and/or trainings is stored on our website and is available to our customers and their authenticated users that have received an invitation from the organizer via email, instant message, phone or other communication method.
Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction.
==========
To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records.
BUSINESS INFORMATION: Information that is collected by our products or by meeting, webinar and training organizers or administrators is considered confidential.
We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service or as required by law.
==========
(Business Information includes schedules, attendee lists, subject names, email addresses, names, session records, and any other business information used while in session) When an attendee registers with one of our customers for an online meeting, webinar or training, that information is provided to the organizer of the session.
Citrix Online may store that information to fulfill our obligation to our customers, but we will not use the information to send marketing communications for Citrix Online services or third party offers to attendees.
You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit while in session and utilizing the chat feature can be read, collected or used by the meeting organizer and other meeting participants.
Chat logs and meeting recordings are not stored or viewable by Citrix Online and are only available locally to meeting organizers and attendees.
We will not view business information, except as necessary to appropriately support the service and for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of our customers’ service experience or as required by law.
==========
PARTNERS: In some cases we provide services or sell product lines jointly with other businesses.
For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to those transactions with that third party.
On the co-branded registration pages we will state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use so that you will know at the time you create your account exactly how your information will be used.
If you are registered with Citrix Online through a partnership and you request to opt out of receiving promotional updates, in order to comply with the provisions in the Can Spam Act, we will also provide your email address to that partner so that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Citrix Online.
AFFILIATES: We may sometimes share or jointly collect information with our parent entity and the wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliated divisions of our parent company entity.
==========
Sharing this information helps us make your customer experience more seamless and efficient by allowing us to improve our marketing efforts to better target customer needs, streamline our processes and consolidate our backend business systems.
SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session.
==========
The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible when using Citrix Online products.
SECURITY INFORMATION: Citrix Online also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes.
==========
This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies and other unique identifying information of machines that have our software downloaded and installed on them.
This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services.
All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers.
==========
GoToAssist has an unattended support permission-based feature and access must be set up in advance and with the approval of the owner of the unattended machine.
The person providing unattended support must provide a strong password, and all network activity is encrypted using both SSL and AES encryption, so only the approved support provider can gain access via the Unattended Support link.
The responsibility for security then rests on the relationship of trust between the support provider and the customer.
Because it is a 100 percent permission-based feature, the customer has the ability to block or disable Unattended Support access at any time, temporarily or permanently.
==========
SURVEYS: In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development.
We use such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services offered to each individual user.
==========

These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
