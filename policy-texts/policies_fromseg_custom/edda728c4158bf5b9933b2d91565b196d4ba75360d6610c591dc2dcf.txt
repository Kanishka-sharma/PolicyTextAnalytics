What are cookies?
==========
Cookies are small text files which our Websites and Apps may put on your computer or mobile device when you use our Websites and Apps.
Cookies are widely used by websites and applications to help remember small amounts of information and to give you a better experience using the website or application.
For example, a cookie will help a website or application to recognise your device the next time you visit so you don’t have to log on again.
==========
Certain cookies contain a limited amount of personal information.
For example, if you click “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username.
Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you and will instead collect more general information to help us analyse how well our Website and Apps are performing overall so we can try and improve them.

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your, logging in or filling in forms so you do not have to enter your details on each page you visit.
You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will then not work.
Performance cookies.

These cookies also help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.
All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
