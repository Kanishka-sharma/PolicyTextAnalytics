2.2
Vonage 911 Disclosure Agreement.
Click here to see details regarding Vonage 911 Calling.
2.3
911 Dialing from Mobile Applications.
Vonage mobile applications are not a replacement for your cellular service and you cannot make emergency (e.g., 911) calls using the software.
If you attempt to make a 911 call from the mobile application the mobile application will close and the call will placed over your cellular carrier's network.
However, this does not prevent you from using your mobile phone for making emergency calls via your cellular provider as normal.
If you dial internationally recognized emergency service numbers while using a mobile application, the mobile application will close, the native dialer will be launched, and the call will placed over your carrier's cellular network.
Neither your phone number nor your location will be reported to an emergency operator when dialing an internationally recognized emergency service number.

SERVICE.
5.1
Service Distinctions.
Our service may be subject to different regulatory treatment than traditional voice telecommunications service.
This treatment may limit or otherwise affect your rights of redress before regulatory agencies.
==========
Our service requires high speed broadband or, for certain mobile applications, a WIFI or other data connection (e.g. 3G/4G) which we do not provide.
Certain of our other services may be used with devices such as wireless telephones, mobile telephones, smartphones, PDA's, tablets or pads which we may or may not provide.
Events beyond our control may affect our service, such as power outages, fluctuations in the Internet, your underlying ISP or broadband service, system maintenance or acts of God.
We will act in good faith using commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions to your use of and access to our service.
==========
5.2
Residential Use of Service and Device.
Vonage's residential and mobile unlimited service plans and features are only for normal residential or personal, non-commercial use.
This means that only the account holder, residential family members, and those Extensions™ phone number(s) registered with Vonage by the account holder may use Vonage's residential and mobile unlimited service plans.
==========
Residential family members refer to those members of your immediate family who reside in your personal residence - e.g., spouse, domestic partner, parents and/or children.
If your residential service plan allows you to extend the service or feature(s) to another residential or mobile number, all use under that service plan is aggregated and must conform to normal residential or personal, non-commercial use.
Some Vonage plans allow for the use of additional devices (such as personal computers, mobile phones, Extensions™ phone number(s) registered with Vonage or other Vonage equipment) outside the residence as part of that service plan.
==========
If you subscribe to a service plan which permits use of more than one device with the same voice line, your usage will be aggregated and assessed in accordance with our Reasonable Use Policy.
Vonage's mobile unlimited service plans and features are for normal, personal non-commercial use and are device specific.
5.3
Small Business Plans.
a.
==========
If you subscribe to any of Vonage's small business plans, including one of our Small Office Home Office ("SoHo") plans, we provide service, features and certain equipment to you solely for use as a small business user or domestic business traveler.
Some Vonage plans allow for the use of additional devices (such as personal computers, mobile phones or other Vonage equipment) as part of these service plans.
If you subscribe to a service plan which permits use of more than one device with the same voice line, your usage will be aggregated and assessed in accordance with our Reasonable Use Policy.
b.
The following uses are not considered small business uses and are not permitted under small business plans: autodialing; continuous or extensive call-forwarding or conferencing; inbound/outbound centralized or distributed call center activity; telemarketing of any kind (including, but not limited to, charitable or political solicitation or polling); fax or voicemail broadcasting; and fax or voicemail blasting.
==========
See Section 10 for more details.
Certain business plans may require you to be responsible for supplying, operating, and supporting the standard SIP-based Customer Premise Equipment for use with the service.
As the subscriber and operator or administrator of this equipment, you are responsible for maintaining the security of the equipment, including but not limited to the physical and network security elements of your equipment, and any and all charges related thereto.
c.
Some business plans may not be eligible for certain promotional offers.
==========
5.4
Inconsistent with Normal Use.
If you use the service, any feature and/or any device (including, but not limited to, your personal computer(s), mobile phone(s) or Vonage equipment) in a way that is inconsistent with the normal use for your service, feature or plan, you will be required, at Vonage's sole discretion, to (a) pay the rates for the service, feature or plan that would apply to the way you used the service, feature or device, (b) change to a more appropriate plan or (c) terminate the plan.
For example, if you subscribe to one of our residential service plans, and your aggregate usage is inconsistent with normal residential or personal use, you may thereafter be required to pay our applicable, higher rates for service for all periods in which your use of our service or the device was inconsistent with normal residential use.
==========
Unlimited voice services are provided primarily for continuous live dialogue between two individuals.
Lack of continuous dialogue activity, unusual calling patterns, excessive conferencing or call forwarding, excessive numbers dialed and/or consistent excessive usage (which may also apply to features such as Directory Assistance) will be considered indicators that your use may be inconsistent with normal use by other Vonage customers aggregating their usage under a similar service plan, or that impermissible use as set forth in Section 10 and/or in the Reasonable Use Policy may be occurring and may trigger an account review or further action by us.
A non-exhaustive list of examples of uses of our service that are generally considered to be inconsistent with normal residential use, include, but are not limited to, use:
by or for others who do not live with you
by others who are not registered Vonage Extensions users
operating a business, even if operating from the residence
at a multi-residential address for more than one single residence
A non exhaustive list of examples of uses of our service that are generally considered to be inconsistent with either residential or commercial use, include, but are not limited to, use:
operating any other enterprise, including not-for-profit or governmental
operating a call center
resale to others
auto-dialing or fax/voice blasts
telemarketing
without live dialogue, including as a monitor, intercom or for transcription
Vonage evaluates customer usage in comparison to similarly situated customers, e.g., residential use under residential service plans or small business use under small business service plans.
For example, over ninety five per cent (95%) of Vonage's residential unlimited calling plan customers use less than three thousand (3000) minutes per month and do not have any unusual calling patterns.
We may conclude that a customer's aggregate usage is outside of normal use if it exceeds 3000 minutes per month IN COMBINATION with one or more of the following, including, but not limited to, excessive:
number of unique numbers called
call lengths
frequency of call forwarding/transferring
conference calling
short duration calls
calls made during business hours
Vonage may take appropriate steps to enforce these Terms of Service and our Reasonable Use Policy.
==========
We reserve the right to review your account and take further action if account usage is beyond normal standards, impermissible or detrimental to other customers' ability to use the service or adversely affects our operations.
We may assess abnormal usage based on comparisons to the usage patterns and levels of our other customers.
If we determine that you are engaging in abnormal or impermissible usage, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform you and provide you with the opportunity to correct the improper usage.
==========
If you fail to correct usage activity to conform to normal use, we may exercise our right to transfer your service to a more appropriate plan, charge applicable rates or suspend or terminate your service.
You acknowledge that if your service is terminated under this provision, you are subject to all applicable fees and taxes at the time your service is terminated.
Vonage's right to terminate your account under Section 6.5(b) (with or for no reason) is not limited by this provision.
==========
Commercial, not-for profit, governmental use or other similar use
The use of the service at a multi-residential address for more than one single residence; or
The use of the service by others who do not reside in your personal residence primarily by reason of its unlimited feature
5.5
No 0+ or Operator Assisted Calling; May Not Support x11 Calling.
Our service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling, including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls.
Our service may not support 311, 511, and other x11 services in one or more service areas.
Our service may support specified dialing such as 911 and 411, although certain mobile applications may not provide such dialing services.
411 charges may vary by plan.
==========
5.6
 No Directory Listing.
The phone numbers you get from us will not be listed by us in any telephone directories.
However, any phone numbers you transfer from your local phone company may be or remain listed.
We have no control over directory listings.

==========

 Fees upon disconnection.

Disconnection by you.
If you attempt to disconnect service for one or more of your lines before the end of your current service term, you will be responsible for all the charges for your current term that are applicable to the disconnected lines(s), including unbilled charges, plus an Early Termination Fee per line, if applicable, as provided in Section 8.7 below.
Cancellation is effective on the date you cancel or designate as the cancellation date (future disconnection date).
==========
Annual prepayment plan charges are not subject to refund.
If you cancel your service before the end of your billing cycle, there are no pro-rated refunds.
Charges for any overages, payphone calls to Vonage toll free numbers, and out-of-plan international calls or any other features and services outside your rate plan are separately billed and charged to your selected payment method after cancellation.
In addition, if you obtain a product or service from us (e.g., a phone adapter) for which a rebate or benefit was given to you that was conditioned on maintaining your Vonage service for a specified length of time, and you disconnect service before the end of that period, you agree to pay us the applicable recovery fee and/or Early Termination Fee.
See Section 8.8 below.
On multiple line accounts, any Early Termination Fee arising from a cancellation of a line that is subject to an ETF must either be paid upon cancellation or the remaining ETF balance may be transferred to one of the other lines on that account.
Such ETF balance continues on the account until either the ETF obligation has expired or been satisfied.
==========
(b)
Disconnection by us without a reason.
If we discontinue service generally, or disconnect your service without a stated reason, you will only be responsible for the charges that have accrued through the date of the disconnection, including a pro-rated portion of the final service term charges, and, if applicable, any recovery and Early Termination Fees.
(c)
Disconnection by us with a reason.
If we disconnect your service for any of the reasons listed in section 6.4 above, you will be responsible for all charges through the end of your current service term, including unbilled charges, plus any applicable disconnection, Early Termination Fees and any recovery fees.
(d)
All charges owed at the time of disconnection will be immediately payable.
At the time of disconnection, we will immediately charge the credit or debit card you have provided to us for payment, or initiate an electronic funds transfer if that is your payment method, for all amounts due at that time.
We will pursue collection for unpaid amounts on disconnected accounts and may report these unpaid charges to credit bureaus.
6.6
 Service Disconnection on Number Transfer or "Port".
==========
(a)
Single line Accounts.
You may be able to take, or "port," your current number to another service provider.

==========
We will terminate our service in this fashion even if you have not independently called us to request disconnection.
Once your service is terminated in this manner, you will remain responsible for all charges and fees through the end of the current billing cycle, including any unbilled charges, as well as for any applicable Early Termination Fees or recovery fees that may be applicable as provided in Sections 8.7 and 8.8 below.
If a port is unsuccessful for any reason, then unless you independently call us to request disconnection or unless we determine to disconnect your line as stated in these Terms of Service, your service and your agreement with us will not terminate, you will remain a Vonage customer, and you will continue to be responsible for all charges and fees associated with your Vonage service.
