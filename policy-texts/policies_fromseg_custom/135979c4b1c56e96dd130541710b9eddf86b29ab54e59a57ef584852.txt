PREAMBLE
Mytraffic company activity is focused on doing marketing studies, including production of statistical data, traffic analysis and catchment area potential, for players in real estate & retail, and for public players, particularly cities.
It should be noticed that the whole Mytraffic business targets B2B customers.
==========
Example of statistical data produced :
- Average number of visitors per day passing in front of 48 rue de Béthune in Lille (France),
- % of visitors to the Quartier Pigalle from the Quartier Nation in Paris.
- Evolution in the monthly number of visitors to the Condé-sur-Sarthe Commercial Activity Zone.
==========
- Heat map of pedestrian traffic in Amiens city (France) centre.
- Averaged socio-demographic profile (based on INSEE information) of pedestrian traffic in the Bordeaux Saint André district.
==========
These data are aggregated data, i.e. several data of the same type put together in order to produce what is known as aggregated data, which contains the desired information but makes it impossible to identify the part of the aggregate information corresponding to a given individual.
None of them allows, directly or by cross-checking, to identify and a fortiori to target an individual user.
==========
This Policy is meant to show transparency and loyalty towards our customers and users of our solutions, and to comply with the regulations on data protection (European GDPR Directive).
Please find below all information related to collection, processing & protection of users’ rights & data.
Personal data encompasses any information or combination of information enabling the identification of a physical person.
As part of its activities, MyTraffic exploits two types of data which can be considered as personal data from a GDPR perspective:
Part of statistical data produced by MyTraffic for its customers are derived from the processing of Users’ geolocated smartphones data (defined as “raw data” hereafter), which can be potentially considered as personal data in the frame of GDPR regulation.
To operate its business (statistics proposed to its clients through software or studies), MyTraffic can collect and process personal information from its prospects & clients, in order to manage its commercial relationship with them, and to ensure the proper functioning of its Products & Services.

==========
DEFINITIONS
Smartphone Geolocation data or Raw data: Smartphone geolocation data (pings journey).
This data may be considered as a Personal Data, from GDPR perspective.
It is treated as such by MyTraffic.
==========
Enriched / Qualified or Converted Data: Statistical data, from raw data processing, in order to analyse footfall of an area or in front of a commercial address, such as « 2 520 visitors in front of the 32, rue de Clichy, in Paris, the June, 15 2018 ».
This data is anonymous & statistical by design.
3.
CONTACT IN CHARGE OF PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING
The company MyTraffic SAS, registered at RCS Bobigny, under the number 814 849 113, operates as Personal Data Controller for the two categories of personal data.
4.
==========
CATEGORIES OF DATA PROCESSED BY MYTRAFFIC
As part of its various solutions and services, MYTRAFFIC offers statistical analysis to commercial real estate players, to support them in their expansion and/or in the management of their sales outlets.
The added value of our service lies in the production and the analysis of statistics, from several data sources.
==========
4.1 Smartphone geolocation data 
In order to analyse physical flows (footfall) in a geographic area, MyTraffic acquires data from data partners, then exploits geolocation data of smartphones, at France country scale.
Geolocation raw data includes the following components:
- Device geolocation (latitude / longitude)
- Timestamp
- Device advertising identifiers (IDFA for iOS, AAID for Android)
- Device operating system (iOS, Android) 
- App-ID
- Settings - Foreground / Background geolocation
- Settings -  Precise geolocation  
Even if MyTraffic has no other information that would allow identification of the smartphone holder (name, email, phone, address ...), these raw data could be potentially considered, in the framework of GDPR, as personal data, and will therefore be treated as such by MyTraffic.
MyTraffic thus ensures that the data partner has collected the raw data with the consent of the user of the smartphone, for the purpose of Marketing Study or Geo-based analytics as described below.
==========
The user may deactivate the geolocation function of his mobile device at any time, in the System Parameters (as described hereunder).
Geolocation data is used along with an advertising identifier.
The advertising identifier is a unique ID for a device.
It can be reset, at any time, by the user, following this approach:
- iOS: go to "Settings", then "Privacy", then "Advertising", then "Reset Advertising ID".
- Android: go to "Settings" then "Google", then in "Ads".
==========
Most data partners from whom Mytraffic can collect geolocation data are referenced by the IAB.
The list of IAB members and Mytraffic suppliers is available at this link.
For further info on our partners, you may contact us at contact@mytraffic.fr.

4.2 Data on Prospects / Clients and on MyTraffic.io Website visitors
MyTraffic proposes solutions to B2B customers, in real estate, retail & public industry.

4.3 Open Data
To carry out its analysis for its clients, MyTraffic uses a variety of open data sources, including INSEE, BODACC, Trade Court, other Open Data (transport, admissions to cinemas, administration locations, etc.) or retail websites (with for example the addresses of their points of sale).
==========
These data are by nature statistical data, with no Personal features.
4.4 Client Data for Analytics
In some cases, our clients rely on us to process their data (such as commercial activity of their points of sale) & hydrid them with our data, in the frame of our contractual relationship.
==========
These data are transmitted, in accordance with the GDPR regulation, and are processed by MYTRAFFIC within the limits of the execution of the contract, to produce statistical analysis, without any search for individuals, and for the only only benefit of the client.
