How your personal information is used
            Adobe collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.
If you order a product that is to be electronically downloaded, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.

The information that you provide is also used as part of our effort to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of Adobe and selected third parties.
Your choices with respect to personal information
            Adobe recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this site.
If you do not want the information you provide to Adobe to be used to inform you of other products, services and special offers available from Adobe, and you indicate this preference when you provide your personal information to Adobe, Adobe will honor your preference.
In addition, Adobe may selectively provide certain information to other companies or organizations that have products or services we think may interest you.
If you do not want to receive promotional materials regarding third party products or services, and you indicate this preference when you provide your personal information to Adobe, Adobe will honor your preference by not providing your information to such third parties.
Adobe reserves the right to provide aggregate data to third parties for statistical analysis.
Such data will not be linked to any particular individuals.
Protection of your personal information
