A Few Words About Safety in Online Shopping
With the online shopping trend increasing on the Internet, shoppers have come to love the ease and convenience.
Also, new advancements in security are making the experience as safe as placing orders over the telephone.
For example, it is technologically easier for a thief to steal your credit card information by either tapping your phone line or stealing the information from the carbon copy of your receipt than it is to steal similar information from our online transactions.
Additionally, federal law protects online transactions handled by credit cards -- you are protected from fraudulent charges by law.
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges.
==========
Our Pledge To You
At Six Flags, we take the security and privacy of your information very seriously.
We have taken necessary steps to assure you that our website is legitimate by ensuring that information sent either way (from you to Six Flags or vice versa) remains secure, private, and intact, even in the unlikely event that it is intercepted.
Also, both parties can be assured that messages are received exactly as sent.
==========
This ultimately results in safe online transactions that protect you, our customer, and us.
To ensure the security of your information, our site uses "Secured Socket Layer (SSL)."
SSL is one of the most sophisticated programs available used to encrypt data as it is sent across the Internet.
How do I know that my information is being transmitted via a secured connection (SSL)?
