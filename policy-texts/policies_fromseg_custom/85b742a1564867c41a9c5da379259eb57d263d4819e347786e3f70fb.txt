Privacy


      We treat user privacy as paramount and maintain the following policies to ensure your privacy is preserved.
You have complete control over who can view your profile


      Access to your profile can be made as open or as restricted as you choose.
The default setting is that only other logged in Change.org 
      members can see your profile.
Information on your profile is limited to your first name and last initial, the organizations and causes 
      you support, your blog postings, and your list of friends.
==========
It does not include any other personal information such as your email or 
      home address.
You may choose to make your profile publicly viewable or can limit access to people in your social network.
You can also make your 
      support of any organization or fundraising campaign completely anonymous.
To edit your privacy settings, click on the "Account Settings" link at the top right of your profile and select the "Privacy" link at the 
      top of the subsequent page.
Your personal information will never be given to anyone without your knowledge


      Your personal information is just that - yours.
We will never give your personal information to any nonprofit without your explicit 
      consent.
==========
However, campaign finance law requires that we share your address and employment information with any campaign that you
      donate to.
This is stated on the donation form when you are about to donate to a political campaign.
If you would like to receive direct communication from the nonprofits you support, you may choose to have us pass them your name, email 
      and/or home address after making a donation.
However, keep in mind that it is fairly common practice for nonprofits to rent or trade 
      the names and addresses of their donors with other organizations.
We cannot control this practice, so if you do not want to receive 
      mail from nonprofits you have not contributed to, first check whether the nonprofits you support have a policy against trading donor 
      information before requesting that we pass them your home or email address.
