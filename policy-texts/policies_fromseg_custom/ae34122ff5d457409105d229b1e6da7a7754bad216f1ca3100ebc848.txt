Compete, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users.
Compete, 
		      Inc. will not license, publish, or sell any information that can be tied to an 
		      individual Internet user that it receives from its data providers.
Compete offers clients aggregate data concerning online consumer behavior by 
		      licensing URL and demographic data (age, gender, household income, geographical 
		      location, etc.) from multiple sources including ISPs and browser companions.
Compete, Inc. honors the privacy policies of its licensors and does not license 
		      personally identifiable information from its licensors.
==========
Inadvertently, the URLs we license sometimes contain personal information about 
		      the Internet users whose behavior our data providers record.
For example, when 
		      an Internet user enters information on a Web page, the operator of the Web site 
		      may insert information into its URL for that or the next page.
This information 
		      often appears after a question mark in the URL, although it can appear in other 
		      places.
This means that a name, address, email address, or similar information 
		      that an Internet user enters into a Web page sometimes becomes part of the URL 
		      that is then transmitted to Compete by its data providers and stored in Compete's 
		      databases.
This can also occur with words, topics, products, or phrases entered 
		      into search engines.
Compete has no control over what information third party 
		      websites put into their URLs or where they put it.
==========
However, Compete, Inc. makes no effort to connect this information with any 
		      personal information about an individual user and does not analyze personally 
		      identifiable information embedded in its licensed data to determine the identity 
		      of any Internet user, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, or other 
		      legal requirements.
Further, Compete aggregates data on multiple users before 
		      supplying data to its clients, thereby ensuring an individual's privacy.
We would be happy to answer any additional questions you may have or to put you 
		      in touch with our Chief Privacy Officer.
Please contact 
		      privacy@compete.com.
