BeerAdvocate.com Rules
BeerAdvocate is here to provide you with a friendly environment where you can ask questions about beer, give advice, converse with other beer geeks and make some new friends in beer.
==========
Our forums are at their best when participants treat their fellow posters with respect.
Therefore, we ask that you conduct yourself in a civilized manner when participating in these forums.
Access to the community is a privilege, not a right, and members who continually breach these rules will find themselves limited or removed from the community, regardless of the other contributions they have made.
==========
Bottom line: We want BeerAdvocate to be an awesome experience for everyone.
Help us make this happen by abiding by the rules.
==========
Please do not post anything which is inappropriate.
This includes, but is not limited to, profanity, sexual, sexualized or illicit content, hateful, threatening, provocative or vulgar content, links and websites and discussion encouraging such activities, or any otherwise illegal content.
Please do not attempt to circumvent the censoring options we have set up.
Be courteous and respect your fellow members.
To be clear, personal attacks, aggressive messages, and passive-aggressive behavior is unacceptable.
==========
If you take particular issue with another user and are unable to reply in a civilized and constructive way to their posts, you should ignore the user.
Posts should always be constructive and on topic.
==========
For common questions, simply telling someone to search is not acceptable.
If you disagree with a post and feel the need to reply as such, it's important that you explain why.
Off topic posts may be moved or deleted as required.
If you feel another user is attacking or being aggressive towards you, report their message to staff.
Do not respond publicly.
This simply continues the back and forth that derails topics and makes them uncomfortable for other users.
If someone attacks you and you respond with an attack, you will be warned regardless of who started it.

All content must be posted in English as it is not possible for us to moderate the forums otherwise.
Exception: Posting in your native language is currently allowed for the following: beer and place reviews, international forums (as applicable), private conversations.
All content must be posted in prose and free from abnormal formatting.
==========
Do not bump threads unless you have something else to add to the discussion.
