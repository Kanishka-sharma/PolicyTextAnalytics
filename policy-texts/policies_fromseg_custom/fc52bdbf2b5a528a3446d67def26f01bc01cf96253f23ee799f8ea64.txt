We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these other sites before providing them with any personally-identifying information.

We will take reasonable steps to permit you to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate.

We may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles.

We engage in periodic self-assessment to ensure compliance with our Privacy Policy.
We verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles.
We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below.
We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.Any claim arising out of or relating to our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles, or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved through our internal processes will be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its applicable commercial rules.
Any arbitrator will be either an attorney or retired judge having significant and recognized experience with and knowledge of privacy issues and information technology.
==========
The arbitration panel should apply New York law, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, as well as the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eg_main_018247.asp).
In addition, the exclusive location for such arbitration will be New York, New York.
All decisions of the arbitration panel will be final and binding on the parties, which waive any right to further appeal the arbitration award, to the extent an appeal may be lawfully waived.
As a not-for-profit organization, we are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the implementation of Safe Harbor Principles; however, we agree to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles in recognition of their importance in ensuring the protection of user information.
