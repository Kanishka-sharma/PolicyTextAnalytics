Introduction
Welcome to Shopify!
This Privacy Policy was written to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your information.
Since technology and privacy laws are always changing, we may occasionally update this policy.
If a significant change is made, we will be sure to post a notice in your account admin.
If you continue to use Shopify after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
By signing up for any of the products or services offered by Shopify (together, the “Services”), or dealing with a merchant using Shopify’s Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Shopify Terms of Service.
This Privacy Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (and your client, employer or another entity if you are acting on their behalf) as the user of the Services (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “you” or “your”) and Shopify Inc. and its affiliates, including Shopify Data Processing (USA) Inc., Shopify Payments (USA) Inc., and Shopify (USA) Inc. (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we”, “our”, “us” or “Shopify”).
If we add any new features or tools to our Services, they will also be subject to this policy.

We will keep your Personal Information accurate, complete and up-to-date with the information that you provide to us.
If you request access to your Personal Information, we will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as allowed by law, and provide you access to that information.
We will always ask for your consent before using your Personal Information for a purpose other than those described in this Privacy Policy.
