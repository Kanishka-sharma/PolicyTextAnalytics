The Platform for Privacy Preferences 
Project
 The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P), developed by the World 
Wide Web Consortium, is emerging as an industry standard providing a simple, automated 
way for users to gain more control over the use of personal information on Web 
sites they visit.
At its most basic level, P3P is a standardized set of multiple-choice 
questions, covering all the major aspects of a Web site's privacy policies.
Taken 
together, they present a clear snapshot of how a site handles personal information 
about its users.
P3P-enabled Web sites make this information available in a standard, 
machine-readable format.
P3P enabled browsers can "read" this snapshot 
automatically and compare it to the consumer's own set of privacy preferences.
P3P enhances user control by putting privacy policies where users can find them, 
in a form users can understand, and, most importantly, enables users to act on 
what they see.

TRUSTe: Protecting Privacy
 TRUSTe believes that an environment of mutual trust and openness will help 
make and keep the Internet a free, comfortable, and richly diverse community for 
everyone.
As an Internet user, you have a right to expect online privacy and the 
responsibility to exercise choice over how your personal information is collected, 
used, and shared by Web sites.
The TRUSTe program was designed expressly to ensure 
that your privacy is protected through open disclosure and to empower you to make 
informed choices.
The TRUSTe trustmark is awarded only to sites that adhere to established privacy 
principles and agree to comply with ongoing TRUSTe oversight and consumer resolution 
procedures.
Privacy principles embody fair information practices approved by the 
U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Federal Trade Commission, and 
prominent industry-represented organizations and associations.
