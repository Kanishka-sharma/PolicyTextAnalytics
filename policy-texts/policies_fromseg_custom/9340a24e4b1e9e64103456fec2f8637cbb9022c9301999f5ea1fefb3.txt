We may also use mobile application plug-ins, such as software development kits, application programming interfaces and similar technologies.
We use these technologies to track your use of our Sites, personalize your experience, deliver advertisements, and for research and marketing, as well as to track your exposure to online advertisements (see Interest-Based Advertising).

We may include applications from third parties on this website or through our Sites, which allow interaction or content sharing by users.
Some of these applications provide specific services or content from a third party, such as a Facebook "Share" or "Like" button, and are visible to you when you visit our Sites.

We also may share information about your activities, including what you view and purchase on the Sites, with a social network, in accordance with your account settings with us or your social networking service, or with your permission.
Please visit the third parties' respective privacy policies to better understand their data collection practices and controls they make available to you.
Interest-Based Advertising
zulily uses the information you make available to us when you interact with our Sites, content, or services to provide you with advertising and offers that are more relevant to you.
We also partner with third party advertising companies to provide advertisements on our Sites and other Sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you, including advertisements for unaffiliated products and services on our Sites.
The advertisements may be based on information collected through cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies from our Sites and on other third-party websites you visit and mobile applications you use that participate in our advertising networks.
These third parties may use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites and mobile applications in their networks beyond these Sites.
While zulily will not share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own uses, such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you.
For information about how we share your information with third parties, please see Information We Share below.
You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the webpages for Facebook's ad preferences tool and privacy policy.
Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device.

Android: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/
Windows: http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out
Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Sites or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs.
It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.
