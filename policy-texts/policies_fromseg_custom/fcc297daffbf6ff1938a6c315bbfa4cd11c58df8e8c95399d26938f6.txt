NOTE: ALEXA INTERNET’S TOOLBAR SERVICE COLLECTS AND STORES INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VIEW AND SEARCH QUERIES YOU MAKE.
IN SOME CASES,
      INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE TOOLBAR SERVICE MAY BE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE, BUT WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE ANY INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE TOOLBAR
      SERVICE TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF ANY ALEXA USER.
What Personal Information Does Alexa Internet Collect?
The information we collect helps us deliver, personalize and continually improve your Alexa Internet experience and provide information about
      Internet trends, website popularity and traffic, and related content.
Here are the types of
      information we gather.
Information You Give Us: We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or
          give us in any other way.
[Click here] to see examples of what we collect.
You can choose not to provide
          certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
We use the
          information you provide for purposes such as responding to your requests, providing, customizing and improving our
          services, communicating with you, complying with our legal obligations, and helping to protect the security of our customers, Alexa Internet, and others.
Automatic Information We Collect From the Toolbar Service: When you use the Toolbar
          Service, we collect and store certain information such as the websites you visit and the
          advertisements you see on those websites, the searches you perform using search engines or the search
          function (if included in your version) of the Toolbar Service, the results of your searches, the ways in which you use various Toolbar
          Service features (including whether the Toolbar Service is still installed on your computer), and your Internet
          Protocol (IP) address.
[Click here] to see additional examples of what we collect.
Although this information may contain some
          personally identifiable information, Alexa Internet does not use it to determine the identity of individual users or
          correlate it to your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information that you give us or our
          affiliates, except as may be required by subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements.
We use the information collected through the Toolbar Service for purposes such as to provide you 
          with information about the websites you are visiting, for example their popularity, similar sites, and load times, 
          and to compile aggregate statistics and other indicators of web usage and traffic and Internet trends that we may make available as part of our Toolbar Service or other offerings.
==========
Other Automatic Information We Collect from Our Website and Other Content: We receive and store certain types of
          information whenever you interact with us.
For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and other unique identifiers, and we may
          obtain certain types of information when your browser accesses Alexa.com or when you interact with our features or content served by or on behalf of us.
We use this information for purposes such as responding 
          to your requests, providing a seamless customer experience, and customizing and improving our services.
==========
In addition, to 
          help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive
          a confirmation (if your device supports such capabilities) when you open e-mails from Alexa Internet or
          click on a link in one of our e-mails.
[Click here] to see examples of the information we receive.
You can choose not to receive marketing e-mails from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any marketing e-mail.
==========
Automatic Information We Collect from Other Websites: Alexa Internet also offers products, such as
          the Alexa Internet measurement pixel, that help website operators analyze traffic to their websites—for
          example, to determine the total number of visitors to a site.
We receive and store certain types
          of personal information when you interact with such third-party websites that use our pixel or other technologies.
[Click here] for examples of such information.
Because Alexa Internet processes this
          information on behalf of the applicable website operators, collection, processing, and use of such
          information is subject to the applicable website operators’ privacy policies and is not covered by
          our Privacy Notice.
For more
          information about how you may choose to prevent an Alexa Internet measurement pixel from recognizing your computer,

Information from Other Sources: We may receive information about you from other sources.

==========
We use this information to compile aggregate statistics and other indicators of Internet trends, website popularity and traffic, popularity of Internet content and topics, and related content.
What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve our services, we may use cookies and other identifiers.
Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device.
Alexa Internet’s cookies allow you take advantage of some of our essential features.
For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to use any Alexa Internet services that require you to sign in to your Alexa account.
==========
Approved third parties, including providers of measurement and analytics services, and advertising companies, may also set cookies or use other identifiers when you interact with Alexa.com.
Third parties use pixels, cookies, and other identifiers in the process of delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform other services on behalf of Alexa Internet.
Please see our Interest-Based Ads notice for more information on how we may use pixels and cookies on our site for interest-based ads.
You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings.
The 'Help' or similar feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how
          to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to disable cookies, and when cookies will expire.
==========
Does Alexa Internet Share the Information It Receives?
We may share our customers’ personal information only as described below and with our parent corporation, Amazon.com, Inc., and the subsidiaries it controls.
Transactions involving Third Parties:  We may make available to you services, products, or applications
          provided by third parties for use on or through Alexa Internet services.
For example, if you use a third-party search engine offered through our Toolbar Service (to the extent supported by your version), we will transmit your
          search term and Internet Protocol (IP) address to that company so that it can provide you with the requested search results.
Likewise, if you download our Toolbar Service from a third-party website, the Toolbar Service may display the
          third party's brand, and consequently that third party may receive information about your use of the Toolbar
          Service.
You can tell when such a 
          third party is involved in your transactions, and if you choose to use such service, customer
          information related to those transactions may be shared with that third party.
Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.
Examples include storing and analyzing data, providing customer service, advertising, and payment processing.
These third-party service providers have access to user information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
==========
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or 
      services.
In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject
       to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise).
Also, in 
       the event that Alexa Internet or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Alexa Internet and Others:  We may release account and other personal information when we believe release is 
      appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, 
      or safety of Alexa Internet, our users, or others.
This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
==========
How Secure Is Information About Me?
Alexa Internet uses commercially reasonable information security safeguards to protect its databases and servers
          against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper
          disclosure of data.
Alexa Internet segregates certain personally identifiable and other information about your use of Alexa Internet's services
          into separate databases, some of which can be accessed only by a limited number of employees.
If you have an Alexa Internet account, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
          password and to your device.
Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared device.
==========
What About Advertising?
We may work with advertising partners to display interest-based ads to you on other websites or applications.
Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized ads, may be displayed to you based on your 
      interactions with such companies’ sites, content, advertising, or services.
Some of these advertising partners may also collect information about you when 
        you interact with our site, content, or services.
We may also provide advertising partners 
        with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Alexa Internet 
        ads and to measure their effectiveness.
For more information on how we work with such advertising 
        partners and to adjust your preferences, please visit our Interest-Based Ads page.
==========
Which Information Can I Access?
If you create an Alexa Internet account, we give you access to a range of information about your account and your
      interactions with us for the purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.

==========
What Choices Do I Have?
You may disable the Toolbar Service from reporting information about your web surfing activities, 
        search terms, results of your searches, and/or statistics about your use of the Toolbar Service.
Depending on which version of the Toolbar Service you are using, you may do so either by using the 
        Options menu (or similar menu item) or by uninstalling the relevant Toolbar Service.
==========
You can choose not to receive marketing e-mails from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any marketing e-mail.
For more information about how to adjust your interest-based advertising preferences, visit our Interest-Based Ads page.
The Help portion on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the 
       browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether.
Because cookies set when you visit our 
       website allow you to take advantage of some of Alexa Internet’s essential features, we recommend that you leave such cookies 
       turned on.
For instance, if you block or otherwise reject certain cookies, you may not be able to use any Alexa Internet products 
       and services that require you to sign in to your Alexa Internet account.
Are Children Allowed to Use Alexa Internet?
Alexa Internet does not offer products or services for use by children.
If you are under 18, you may use Alexa Internet's website or the Toolbar 
      Service only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

Examples of Information Collected
 Information You Give Us When You Use Our Services
If you register for an account at Alexa.com, sign up for or subscribe to an Alexa Internet service (other than the Toolbar Service), 
      or download or request Alexa Internet content, we may collect information such as your name, address, e-mail address, country,
       nickname, telephone number, website, company, job title, and credit card information.
You may also provide us with similar information when you communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise or complete a questionnaire, a support ticket, or a contest entry form.
Automatic Information We Collect From the Toolbar Service
For every web page you view while using the Toolbar Service, the Alexa Internet software transmits and stores 
      information such as your IP address, the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and 
      from the web page you are visiting, general information about your browser, general information about your 
      computer's operating system, a unique identifier enabling Alexa Internet to recognize your Toolbar Service, 
      and the date and time the above information is logged.
The Toolbar Service also automatically collects information 
      about the online advertisements that are displayed on the websites you visit including, the text, source, 
      and URL of the online ad, and the terms you choose when you use search engines to search the Web, and the 
      results of your searches.
==========
Alexa Internet also periodically collects usage statistics from Toolbar Service that describe the frequency of use of each
      Toolbar Service feature.
Finally, to ensure accurate information about the number of Toolbar Service users, the Toolbar
       Service periodically sends a signal to Alexa Internet containing basic information such as the 
       IP address of your computer.
Automatic Information We Collect From Our Website
Examples of the information we collect and analyze when you use our website or interact 
      with our services include the IP address used to connect your device to the Internet; 
      device and connection information such as browser type, browser engine, version, 
      and time zone setting; browser plug-in types and versions; operating system; 
      purchase (e.g., subscription) history; the full URL clickstream to, through, 
      and from our website, including date and time; cookie number; web pages you 
      viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call us.
==========
We may also use browser data such as cookies or similar data on certain 
      parts of our website for fraud prevention, to provide a seamless customer experience, 
      and for other purposes.
During some visits to our website we may use software tools 
      such as JavaScript to collect information about your engagement with our content, 
      including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, 
      page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, downloads, and mouse-overs), 
      and methods used to browse away from the page.
Automatic Information We Collect From Other Websites
Examples of automatic information we collect from third-party websites on behalf of website
      operators for their traffic analysis include the account identifier of the
      website operator, the URLs of web pages visited, any referring URLs to those web pages, the IP addresses and
      browser information, such as browser type, browser engine, operating
      system, and version, of website visitors, and a unique identifier for each website visitor.
Information from Other Sources
An example of information we might receive from other sources is when you authorize a 
      third-party service, such as Facebook’s Login With Facebook feature, to interact directly 
      with our website to provide or receive personalized information about you.
In that case, 
      we may receive such information as your name and other information used by that third-party 
      website to identify your account with that website (for example, when you use Login With 
      Facebook to access your Alexa Internet account).
Additional examples of information from other sources include information we may receive 
      from our partners to improve our web information services, which may include truncated IP 
      addresses and unique identifiers for website visitors; browser information; the full URL 
      clickstream for websites visited along with advertisements on those websites, and the 
      searches performed using search engines along with their results.
We may also receive 
      certain public information from social media services, such as Reddit and Twitter, 
      which may include public posts, likes, and similar engagement with content publicly
