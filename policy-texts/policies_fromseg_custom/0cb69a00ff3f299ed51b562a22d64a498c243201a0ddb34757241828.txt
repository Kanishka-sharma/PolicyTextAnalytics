Data Controller/Processor
Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the “data controller” (or under the CCPA, "business"), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “data processor” (or under the CCPA "service provider"), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller.
Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
Appreciate is the “data controller” of its Visitors’, Prospects’ and Customers’ Personal Data, and with respect to which, assumes the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If a Customer or Partner provides us with any End User Data, or Appreciate otherwise obtains any such Personal Data and processes it on the Customer’s behalf, such Customer shall be deemed the “data controller” of this data, and Appreciate will be processing such End User Data as the Customer’s “data processor”.
This will be done in accordance with the Customer’s reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms of Service and other commercial agreements.
The Customer will be solely responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers of such data (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to data subject requests concerning the data they control).
The same will apply in regards to Personal Data received from our Partners (unless such data will be used for Appreciate own needs, in which case Appreciate will assume the role of "data controller")
If Appreciate collects and processes any End User Data on its own behalf, for example so it could analyze such data and obtain insights concerning user types or groups, Appreciate shall be deemed as the “data controller” of such Personal Data.
==========
If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on our Customers’ or Partners' behalf, please contact them directly.
Should we receive such requests directly, we may refer them to our Customer and/or Partner, as applicable.
