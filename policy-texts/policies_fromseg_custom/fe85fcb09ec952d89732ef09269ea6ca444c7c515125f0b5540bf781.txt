Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC.
Websites typically usetemporary cookies called “session” cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within one site and that any information you have entered is remembered.
For example, if an e commerce site did not use session cookies then items placed in a shopping basket would disappear by the time you reach the checkout.
Websites also use cookies called “persistent” cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered.
==========
Little Things may install both persistent and session cookies when a user arrives at the Site.

==========
Dispute Resolution Provisions.
The Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in New York, New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles).
Should a dispute arise concerning the LittleThings™ Offerings, any User Submitted Content or Feedback, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties; and (b) each User agrees to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found Here.
We may choose to provide petitioning Users with a final written settlement offer after receiving such User’s Initial Dispute Notice (“Final Settlement Offer”).
If we provide a petitioning User with a Final Settlement Offer and that User does not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve that User’s dispute and that User wishes to proceed, that User must submit its dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in that User’s county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available Here.
For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, a User can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.
If the arbitrator awards a User relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if that User retained an attorney to represent it in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys’ fees that such User’s attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.
==========
Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration.
Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from any User unless the arbitrator determines that such User’s claim was frivolous.
==========
To the extent permitted by law, each User agrees that it will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that it may have against LittleThings™ and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns.
Each User agrees to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove it as a participant in the suit.
Each User agrees to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that LittleThings™ incurs in seeking such relief.
This provision preventing Users from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any User’s rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (B) is an independent agreement.
Any User may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of her/his decision within thirty (30) days of the date that she/he first accesses the Site.
22.
==========
Miscellaneous.
To the extent that anything in or associated with the LittleThings™ Offerings is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence.
Our failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision.
The parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement.
Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
