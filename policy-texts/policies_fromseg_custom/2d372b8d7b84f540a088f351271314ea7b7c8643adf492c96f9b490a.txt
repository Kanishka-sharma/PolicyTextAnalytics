ChronoForms License
To be able to continue working at this component we decided to get a small profit out of it but at the same time don't force everybody to pay in order to use this great component.
From version 1.5 and up a link at the bottom of everyform created will be placed, saying "
joomla professional work
", the link will be to us here htttp://www.chronoengine.com, its illegal to remove this link from the source code unless you have a license,
so the license is very simply for the same ChronoForms component without a link, thats all!
This License is for 5 different websites ONLY.
However, in order to allow everybody to still use the component and even get out of this, the link is inside a div with class : chronoform , use this to hide the link by using different colors or whatever if you really can't pay, but of course the link is still exists at your page source.
The license is ONLY 25$ can be bought here :
Thank you!
