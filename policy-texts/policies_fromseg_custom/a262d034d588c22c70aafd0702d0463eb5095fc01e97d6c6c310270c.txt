Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust is our priority.

Ensighten adheres to industry best practice privacy principles outlined by the Web Analytics Association Code of Ethics with respect to the data collection practices at our websites; including the site that you are now visiting and the site that each of our clients uses to access the data we collect on the client's behalf pursuant to the client's instructions.
Our fundamental privacy principles incorporate the guidelines suggested by the Federal Trade Commission for web sites that collect personally identifying information - Notice, Choice, Access, and Security - which are discussed below.
==========
Notice – Ensighten is committed to making our data collection practices readily available to you so that you can make informed decisions about your activities at our websites.
Choice – Ensighten provides you with the opportunity to elect not to participate in our data collection activities.

Access – We provide all visitors to our websites with the opportunity to review, modify, and delete any personally identifiable information that has previously been provided.
What We Collect and How We Use It

We will also collect any personally identifiable information that you may send to us or provide to us on our forms (such as Resume Submission or Request for Information).
We use this information in connection with fulfilling your request, for our own marketing purposes, or to consider your application for employment.
==========
We may also provide this information to our marketing partners so that you may receive marketing information from them, but only if you affirmatively request that we do so.

We also collect user ID, username, and password.
We use the information that we collect to improve the way that we provide our Services, to relay administrative information, and to verify login information.
==========
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain of our assets.
In such transactions, visitor information likely will be one of the transferred business assets.
Also, in the event that Ensighten, Inc. or substantially all of its assets is acquired, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred.
