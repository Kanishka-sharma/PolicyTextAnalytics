Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information
NVIDIA respects your choices about how your Personal Information is used when you register with us, elect to receive our newsletters, or provide us with Personal Information for other purposes.

Marketing communications.
You can opt-out of receiving communications from NVIDIA at any time by unsubscribing at https://profile.nvidia.com/en-us/login, or by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any e-mail or SMS communications you receive.
If you are using our apps we may also send you push notifications which you can opt out of receiving using the app settings.
However, we may still send you updates to our Legal Notices, Online Privacy Policy, or regarding any account you have created with us.
==========
Online advertising and other tracking.
As discussed above, NVIDIA collects certain information about you when you use our Services through technology such as cookies, web beacons and similar tools.
Because we use this information only for internal and analytic purposes, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser will not have any effect on our collection of cookie information for these purposes.
The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device.
To learn more about cookies, please read our cookie policy at http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/cookie-policy-uk.html.
We permit third party ad networks and social media companies to use cookies, plug-ins and other technology to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites when you visit our Site.
For example, we use advertising services provided by third party ad partners to employ cookies and other tracking technology to market our services to you on other websites.
==========
We do not control the opt-out mechanisms of these third party ad partners.
To avoid tracking by these third party ad partners, you can change your browser settings to reject cookies or to notify you when cookies are set and you could select the Do Not Track option on your browser, though we have no control over and cannot confirm whether these third parties honor the Do Not Track browser signal.
Additionally, many advertising companies who operate in the United States are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) which provide opt-outs for member companies at www.networkadvertising.org/choices or www.aboutads.info/choices.
