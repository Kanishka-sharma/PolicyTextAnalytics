The Chicago Tribune is dedicated to providing visitors to chicagotribune.com and its other online services with a highly interactive and personalized experience, while at the same time protecting users from unexpected use of personally identifiable information.
Like other Web publishers, we collect information from users in order to deliver more individualized content and advertising to them, but only within the limits specified in this policy.
How we gather information from users

chicagotribune.com requires users to register with us and provide certain information, including an e-mail address, in order to gain access to some content.
==========
Some of the demographic information we request will be voluntary and identified as "optional" during the registration process.
You may change or update your registration with us at any time by returning to this page, or by pointing your Web browser at http://www.chicagotribune.com/go/register.
==========
We also gather individually identifiable information that you provide to us on a voluntary basis in connection with activities other than accessing our sites.
For example, information may be gathered from: sweepstakes and contest registration or submissions; voting and polling activities; message boards and chat rooms; registration for subscription services related to either the printed or electronic editions of the newspaper; or from other interactive areas of our sites.
In connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you will be asked to provide information, including credit card information, that is necessary to complete a transaction you have requested.

chicagotribune.com also employs "cookie" technology to improve your navigation through the site and to allow customization of the site according to your individual preferences.
Once you register with us, a string of information (the cookie) is passed to your web browser and stored on your computer.
This cookie identifies you as a unique, registered user and holds your preferences as you have identified them during the registration and customization process.
The cookie stores your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit and granting you the access privileges associated with your registration.
Cookies may also be used to control the number of times you encounter particular advertisements while visiting our sites.
You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do we will not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences and you will often be asked to re-enter your user name and password.
Like most web sites, chicagotribune.com also logs IP addresses, or the electronic location of your computer on the Internet.

Typically, during your visit to our sites, we will use your registration and demographic information to deliver targeted editorial or advertising content we think might interest you.
We may also combine information about you, your computer, and your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to create profiles of chicagotribune.com users as a whole and to identify their preferences in content and advertising.
This aggregated information occasionally may be shared with our advertisers and business partners as well as used by chicagotribune.com and its related companies.
We will use personal information to communicate with you about: your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policies; other services and products offered by the Chicago Tribune and its related companies; and other important information.
We may also communicate with you about changes and improvements to chicagotribune.com and to inform you of sweepstakes or promotions that we are conducting.
From time to time, we or our advertising and promotional partners may call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you.
