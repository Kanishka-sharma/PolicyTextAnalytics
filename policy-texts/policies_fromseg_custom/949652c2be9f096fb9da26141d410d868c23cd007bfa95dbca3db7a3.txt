LINKING SITES
The sites contain links to other websites.
Goodway Group is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, including any websites that may indicate a special relationship or partnership with us (such as co-branded pages or “powered by” or “in cooperation with” relationships).
We do not share information we gather with other websites or any other entities or individuals unless such sharing is disclosed to you in advance through this Privacy Policy.
Other linked websites, however, may collect personal information from you that is not subject to our control.
To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policy of the websites you may visit by linking from the sites.
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to our sites, and not to other companies’ or organizations’ websites to which we link.
==========

This information is stored in Google’s servers according to their privacy practices.
SOCIAL MEDIA
We may collect information from other sources, such as social media platforms that may share information about how you interact with our social media content.
We do not control how your personal information is collected, stored or used by such third-party websites or to whom it is disclosed.
You should review the privacy policies and settings on any social media website that you subscribe to so that you understand the information they collect and may be sharing.

==========
Goodway Group is not responsible for how these third-party websites may use information collected from or about you.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the Goodway Group providing it.
HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
We generally retain your information as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable laws, and we will establish a document/information retention policy to govern our retention of such information.
We may retain copies of information about you and any transactions or Services you have used for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce other applicable agreements or policies or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.
==========
In some circumstances we may anonymize or de-identify your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
This allows the specific information collected (name, email, address, phone number, etc.) to become anonymous, but allows Goodway Group to keep the non-personal information.
For example, Goodway Group will not be able to tell if John Smith registered for an event, but we will be able to tell that a person registered for an event and maintain headcount and transactional history.
This will allow Goodway Group to maintain a level of information that helps us develop and improve our sites and Services.
