We think it is important that you understand your privacy and security rights and interests wherever you are on the internet or otherwise, so please consult privacy and security information on the sites of third parties that you may come into contact with when using zulily.
Their privacy policies apply to information that they collect and use, not ours.

The information we collect falls into two categories: Personal Information and Usage Data.
Personal Information is information that we directly associate with an identifiable person or entity, such as name, address, telephone numbers, email addresses, twitter handle, Social Security Number, demographic information (such as date of birth, age and gender), payment information (including credit card numbers or online payment services numbers), financial information (such as bank account numbers), purchase history and location information (often from the device on which you use our site or mobile applications).
We may obtain Personal Information about you from various sources, such as this and other websites and mobile applications, third parties and when you call or email us or interact with us via social media.
==========
You may also submit Personal Information to us in other ways, such as participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes, subscribing to newsletters and other offerings through the zulily website.
In addition, we may combine information received from third parties with Personal Information and Usage Data we collect about you.
Usage Data is anonymous information regarding use of our website or services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of zulily, often through the use of automated means.
Usage Data collected through these automated means may include information that we gather and store about your visit to, and use of, the zulily website, such as your IP address and the location of your IP server, type of browser and operating system used, date and time you access the websites, pages you visit, and if you linked to this website from another website, the address of that website.
==========
Usage Data does not include Personal Information and is not treated as Personal Information under this Notice.
Cookies and web beacons are sometimes used to collect Usage Data.
“Cookies” are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your device’s hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on websites or storing information or settings in your browser.
A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
In addition to the cookies and web beacons we deliver and use, we may also allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include cookies and web beacons within the pages of the zulily website on our behalf and to retain and use Usage Data received from such cookies and web beacons themselves.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
You may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of the website or service that placed the cookie may not function properly or at all as a result.
