Some of the device and usage data collected by the services, whether alone or in conjunction with other data, could be personally identifying to you.
Please note that this device and usage data is primarily used to identify the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals), apart from where it is strictly required to identify an individual for security purposes or as required as part of our provision of the services to our customers.
==========
3.2 Cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our website and in email communications
We use technologies such as web beacons, pixels, tags, and JavaScript, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to gather information about the use of our websites and how people interact with our emails.
When you visit our websites, we, or an authorized third party, may place a cookie on your device that collects information, including Personal Data, about your online activities over time and across different sites.
==========
Cookies allow us to track use, infer-browsing preferences, and improve and customize your browsing experience.
We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites.
Session-based cookies exist only during a single session and disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off the device.
Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser or turn your device off.
To change your cookie settings and preferences for one of our websites, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.
You can also control the use of cookies on your device, but choosing to disable cookies on your device may limit your ability to use some features on our websites and services.

The following describes how we use different categories of cookies and similar technologies and your options for managing the data collection settings of these technologies:
Required cookies
Required cookies are necessary for basic website functionality.
Some examples include: session cookies needed to transmit the website, authentication cookies, and security cookies.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we may place on your browser a cookie that allows us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the websites and to process your online transactions and requests.
==========
Because required cookies are essential to operate the websites, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.
Functional cookies
Functional cookies enhance functions, performance, and services on the website.
==========
Some examples include: cookies used to analyze site traffic, cookies used for market research, and cookies used to display advertising that is not directed to a particular individual.
Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant communications, including marketing communications.
These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.
We may use third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.
==========
For example, we use Google Analytics (“Google Analytics”), a web analytics service provided by Google.
Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how our websites are used, including the number of visitors, the websites from which visitors have navigated to our websites, and the pages on our websites to which visitors navigate.
This information is used by us to improve our websites.
Advertising cookies
Advertising cookies track activity across websites in order to understand a viewer’s interests, and to direct marketing to them.
We sometimes use cookies delivered by us or by third parties to show you ads for our products that we think may interest you on devices you use and to track the performance of our advertisements.
==========
For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.
Bannerflow also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites.
Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services by collecting device and usage data through automated means, including through the use of cookies.
These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use.
When we work with third party advertising networks, we require them to restrict their data processing to only what is necessary to provide us with the advertising services we request.
==========
3.4 Opting Out from cookies
An exhaustive list of cookies used can be found in our Cookie Policy, where you can opt out for the above mentioned cookies.
You can opt out from Bannerflow’s cookie placement (made on behalf of our customers, in our role as processors) there as well.
