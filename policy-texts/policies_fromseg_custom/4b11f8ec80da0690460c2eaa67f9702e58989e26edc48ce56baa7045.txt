EA.COM TERMS OF SERVICE     EA.comSM, an online game service and a collection of game specific web sites dedicated to Electronic Arts's and its affiliates' games ("EA.com" or the "Service"), is offered by EA.com Inc, a division of Electronic Arts.
Three documents make up EA.com's Terms of Service ("TOS"): the Rules of Play, the Privacy Policy, and the Membership Agreement.
Your use of EA.com is subject at all times to our Rules of Play and our Â Privacy Policy.
Your use of EA.com constitutes your acceptance of these terms.
You may also become a Member of EA.com by registering on our site.
To be a Member, you must accept all of the terms and conditions of the Membership Agreement.
If you have questions about any of these documents, please contact us by sending an email to TOS@ea.com        EA.com TOS:  Rules of Play        The Rules of Play tell you what you can expect on EA.com, and the kind of online behavior we expect of you.
It also contains the terms on which we make the Service and any software available.
Our player community is always evolving, so it's important that you periodically check here (as well as the rules and instructions in your favorite game areas) for updates and new information.
All of our games, activities and other services, regardless of when they are added to EA.com are governed by our Terms of Service.
==========
Appropriate Online Content.
By   "Content," we mean the software, communications, images, sounds, and all the material and information you see on our Service.
EA.com, our Members, our affiliates, and our independent content providers provide most of the Content on EA.com.
EA.com does not pre-screen all Content available on our Service.
EA.com does not assume any responsibility or liability for Content that is provided by Members or other guests on EA.com.
EA.com does not endorse, approve, or prescreen any Content that you or other users communicate on the Service.
==========
We reserve the right to remove Content that is objectionable to us for any reason.
Neither EA.com nor its affiliates assume any liability for any failure to remove, or any delay in removing, Content.
You bear the entire risk of the completeness, accuracy or usefulness of Content found on our Service.
Members and other guests may generate Content in chat rooms, message boards, and in chat during games, etc.
This kind of Content must reflect our standards, and we may remove it if, in our best judgment, it does not meet those standards.
When we do, if you are a Member, you may receive a warning from us if your Account (described in the Membership Agreement) was responsible for posting the offensive Content.
If it's a serious offense or you've violated our rules before, we may ban you from participating on EA.com and terminate your Member Account.
==========
Content standards may vary depending on where you are on EA.com, the type of game you are playing and the expectations of the community.
Some game play and chat rooms may involve use of stronger language than others, including mild expletives.
Strong vulgar language, crude or explicit sexual references, discussions of illegal drugs, and hate speech are offensive and always inappropriate Content for EA.com.
In other cases, there may be "gray areas".
Always use your best judgment.
If you would not say something in a room full of people you have never met, or in the workplace, please don't post it on our message boards or chat.
==========
EA.com makes the final determination about whether Content is objectionable or not.
This determination is in our sole discretion, and is final.
EA.com representatives may monitor your communications on EA.com.
But, because we cannot monitor all of the Content on EA.com, and we do not attempt to do so, you might encounter something you don't want to see.
==========
You can report it to the game support or complaint e-mail address for the area in which the incident occurred.
Some of the areas on EA.com allow you to filter the chat you see.
You can use this feature to reduce your exposure to words you do not wish to see.
Reading the game help documents, or asking our EA.com staff members or other players in the game is a great way to learn how to use these tools.
(Remember: EA.com staff members will not ask you for your password or account information.)
==========
Your good judgment in making reports, particularly about the opinions of others, is important and appreciated.
EA.com does not endorse or oppose the opinions of any Member or guest, but we may take issue with the manner in which an opinion is expressed       Online Conduct.
You agree that you will be personally responsible for your use of the Service and for all of your communication and activity on the Service, including any Content you contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA.com Inc., its parent, affiliates, employees, officers, and directors from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on EA.com, including any Content that you contribute.
Online conduct should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette.
==========
You will violate the Terms of Service if you (or others using your Account) do any of the following:       Post, transmit, promote, or distribute Content that is illegal.
Harass, threaten, embarrass, or do anything else to another Member or guest that is unwanted.
This means: don't say bad things about them, don't keep sending them unwanted messages, don't attack their race, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, etc.
If you disagree with someone, respond to the subject, not the person.
Transmit or facilitate distribution of Content that is harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, vulgar, sexually explicit, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, or in a reasonable person's view, objectionable.
==========
Hate speech is not tolerated.
Disrupt the flow of chat in chat rooms with vulgar language, abusiveness, hitting the return key repeatedly or inputting large images so the screen goes by too fast to read, use of excessive shouting [all caps] in an attempt to disturb other users, or flooding [posting repetitive text].
This is online vandalism, and it ruins the experience for others.
==========
You may not impersonate another person (including celebrities), indicate that you are an EA.COM employee or a representative of EA.COM, or attempt to mislead users by indicating that you represent EA.com Inc. or any of EA.com's partners or affiliates.

Upload any software or Content that you do not own or have permission to freely distribute       Promote or encourage any illegal activity including hacking, cracking or distribution of counterfeit software;       Upload files that contain a virus or corrupted data;        Post messages for any purpose other than personal communication, or transmit advertising, promotional materials, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or make any commercial use of our Service.
