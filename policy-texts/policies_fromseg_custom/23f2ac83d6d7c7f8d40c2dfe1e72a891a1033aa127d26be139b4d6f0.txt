General Overview
Welcome to AXS!
This website, mobile application and service is owned and operated by AXS Group LLC, and its affiliates AXS Digital LLC in the United States, and 9390936 Canada, Inc. in Canada (collectively, "AXS" or "we").
This Privacy Policy applies to our websites located at axs.com, ticketingcentral.com, flashseats.com and any other website where we post these terms (the "Site(s)"), our mobile applications (the "Mobile App(s)"), our ticketing SDKs and APIs ("APIs"), and our self-service ticket kiosks (the "Kiosk(s))".
The Site, Mobile App, APIs, and Kiosks are collectively referred to as the "Services."
==========
This Privacy Policy discloses what information we may collect when you use our Services, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms of Use for our Services.
Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Terms of Use.
Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online or through our web-enabled services (such as our Kiosks).
Through your use of any of our Services, you consent to the practices described in this Policy.
Third parties
This Policy does not apply to information collected by or provided to third parties.
For example, we often collect and transfer Personal Information to our sponsors, partners, and other third parties (collectively, "Partners") and we act as a service provider for our clients, the venues, promoters, and/or teams ("Clients") when we sell tickets on their behalf.
Similarly, when using our Services you may visit other merchants (e.g. unaffiliated ticket sites) through links on our Services.
==========
Each of these parties may collect and use your Personal Information differently from us.
Please take a moment to review the privacy policies of third-party sites before you disclose information to them.
AXS is not responsible for their actions with regard to your information.
==========
Types of information that may be collected 
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" refers to information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, email address, etc., and any other information about an identifiable individual.
The Personal Information we collect is used to facilitate the purchase and delivery of tickets and/or other products, services, or information to our customers, and we may require our customers to provide certain Personal Information in some instances.
We also collect non-Personal Information such as browsing patterns, geographic location and demographics, which does not reveal your specific identity, as further described below.
How is this information collected and used?
We generally collect information from you in the following ways: 
Transaction Information
If you place an order on our Services—including our APIs--we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information.
We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, e.g., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to send you a record of your transaction.
==========
Please note, when we collect information through our API, we will collect the information on behalf of ourselves and our Client or Partner.
We will provide the information to that Client or Partner the time of sale.
Our policy does not govern their treatment of your information.
==========
When you purchase a Right, ticket or other merchandise
The Personal Information that may be collected from our customers in completion of a ticket, Right (as defined in our Terms of Use), product and/or service purchase, may include, but may not be limited to: customer's first and last name, first and last name of the credit card owner, credit card billing address, credit card number, credit card security code, credit card expiration date, customer's shipping address, phone number, and email address.
You may also have the opportunity to permit us to maintain this information in a personal profile for you so you do not have to re-enter the information each time you make a purchase.
If a customer sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
Through Flash Seats, we may collect your Personal Information from you when you (i) bid on, or purchase Right(s); (ii) purchase Right(s) from a Client through the Service; (iii) sign-up or subscribe for products or services that we may periodically make available; or (iv) receive Right(s) transferred to you from one of our account holders.
Whenever you receive Right(s) transferred to you from one of our account holders, your Personal Information will be provided to us by the originating account holder.
When you accept the Right, you may be required to supply additional Personal Information in order to complete the transfer transaction.
==========
Please note, when we collect information through our API, we will collect the information on behalf of ourselves and our Client or Partner.
We will provide the information to that Client or Partner the time of sale.
Our policy does not govern their treatment of your information.
==========
Registration
If you register on our Services, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email, address and any other Personal Information required on the registration form.
You may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features our Services may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, newsletters, contests, notifications, or other services.
Certain of our Services may include a user portal for you to manage your ticket purchases and other matters.
==========
In such cases, you may designate Associate Account Holders to manage aspects of your account.
When you add an Associate Account Holder, that Associate Account Holder may be able to view, add, modify or delete your payment information, process payments, or forward tickets on your behalf.
By designating an Associate Account Holder, you agree to share such information with such Associate Account Holder(s) in accordance with this policy.
==========
Newsletters, Emails, Mobile Offers
We may offer newsletters and/or other communications to share information with you about the Services, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners, advertisers and sponsors.
You may receive a newsletter from us or our Partners or Clients (as appropriate) either by registering for a particular newsletter, offer, or category of offers (e.g. Partner/Client offers), or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered through the Services.
You may cancel your subscription by following the instructions provided on the Services, in the designated area of the newsletters or emails, or as specified in a mobile communication.
Remember, if you consent to receive Mobile App alerts or texts from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on incoming texts.
Please check with your wireless carrier for details.
==========
Contests or Sweepstakes
We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Services, which may require registration in order to enter.
Your Personal Information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes.
Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our marketing lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes.
Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Services, such as on a winner's page.
In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Services, and collect your information.
In those cases, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy, before participating.
==========
Surveys or Voting
From time-to-time, we may request Personal Information from you via surveys or voting polls.
Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information.
At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.
==========
By completing the survey, you consent to our collection of any Personal Information and other data you provide, and use of that Personal Information and other data to administer, respond to, analyze or otherwise complete the survey process or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
Mobile App & Location Services
If you download and use our Mobile App, we or third party service providers may collect certain information through that Mobile App.
Information collected may include the Personal Information and other registration, login, or payment information you choose to provide; information about your device, such as your IP address, OS, device model, your device's proprietary advertising identifier; and information relating to how you use the Mobile App, such as the content you view, ads you click, and purchases you make.
When you consent to our use of location services, or otherwise depending on the settings on your mobile device, we or third party service providers may collect the precise location information provided by your device, including data provided by your GPS, WiFi, or data obtained when the Mobile App interacts with a beacon or other technology at a venue.
==========
We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running.
If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off using your device’s notifications settings.
To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.
==========
We may use data collected from physical proximity beacons (which may be located in some of the venues or events for which we have sold tickets) to send you relevant, targeted offers based on this data (for example, a discount on food purchases near our event).
We and any third parties enabling these features may store this data and combine it with other information about you.
You may disable the communication of these beacons with your mobile device by disabling Bluetooth or modifying your preferences for location services through your OS.
We collect the information primarily to facilitate the functionality of our Mobile App and deliver relevant content to you.
For example, we may collect your registration and payment information so we can show you content that interests you and to process transactions on your behalf.
We may collect your device's location in order to show you offers or features available near you, to deliver more relevant information and ads, and to understand how users interact with a venue or at events we have ticketed.
We may combine data we collect through our Mobile App with other information we hold about you so that we can personalize or improve the relevance and quality of the services we provide you.
==========
AXS Invite
If you choose to use our AXS InviteTM feature, we ask you for your friend's name and email address.
We will send your friend an invite email on your behalf.
AXS or our service providers store this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation email along with subsequent email reminders if your friend has not responded to the original request.
Your friend may contact us at guestservices@axs.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
By using this feature, you represent and warrant that you have a personal relationship with the addressee to whom you request that we send a message on your behalf.
You may not use this feature if you do not have a personal relationship with the addressee.
==========
Automatic collection when you access our Services
Our Services automatically collect certain information from you when you use them.
For example, some of our Services use cookies and other similar tracking technologies to provide essential features and improve your experience when using our Services (see below for more information).
Additionally, through our Services, our servers or networks may collect your device’s IP address and other device or network information, such as your screen resolution, OS version, browser version, and certain identifiers.
We use this information to help ensure that our content is displayed properly, so that we can understand how, where and which devices access our Services, and to improve the quality and delivery of our Services.
==========
We may log click-stream or similar data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Services, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and other internal uses related to the Services.
Click-stream data is information collected when you request pages from our Services, and may include information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, and other non-Personal Information.
This data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at our Services, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of events, content, advertising, and the like.
We may associate click-stream, shopping cart, ticket purchase (whether complete or incomplete) and other similar data with other information we hold about you so that we can personalize or improve the relevance and quality of the services we provide to you.
==========
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.
==========
Cookies, tracking, and interest-based advertising
Our Services may use cookies, web beacons, and similar digital tracking technologies.
Cookies are small data files transferred to your hard drive when your browser settings permit the acceptance of cookies.
Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email.
The request for these files from a server reveals certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information.
==========
To learn more about cookies, similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit allaboutcookies.org.
For example, our Services may use cookies or other technologies provided by website analytics services such as Google Analytics to help us better understand how our Services are used.
By tracking how and when you use our Services, these technologies help us determine which features and content on our Services are most important to our visitors.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies using your browser’s settings menu; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide a personalized or user-friendly experience.
To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit Google Analytics Terms of Use, the Google Privacy Policy, or Google Analytics Opt-out.
Data about your activities online may be collected for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests, either by us, our affiliates, or third parties.
We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content.
You may or may not be offered a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose.
The information collected may include information about your visits to our Services, such as the pages you have viewed.
==========
These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.
This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Services and on third-party websites or services that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Services.
==========
We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

Please note, most modern browsers include a "do not track" feature that may help protect your privacy.
However, because there is not yet a defined response to do-not-track requests, our Site does not respond to your browser’s do-not-track request.
==========
If you do not wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking http://preferences-mgr.truste.com or visit the Digital Advertising Alliance in the U.S. at http://www.aboutads.info/choices or in Canada at http://youradchoices.ca/choices(or if located in the European Union click http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.

We reserve the right to share your Personal Information with our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies.
We may also share your Personal Information and other information with trusted third parties, such as our Partners, sponsors, or their affiliates and subsidiaries and other related entities for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may occasionally allow third parties to access certain Sites for marketing purposes.

Your Ticket/Right Purchases
When you buy, transfer, sell, or bid on Rights or tickets, and manage your account, we may share you information as follows:

When you purchase a Right or ticket, we may be contractually required to provide your Personal Information to the host of the applicable event ("Event Host") so that they may communicate with you about the event you are going to attend.
Should you determine to sell or otherwise transfer your Right(s), we may be contractually required to provide your Personal Information to the Event Host's third party service providers who provide the Event Host with such transfer services.
Under those circumstances, you will be required to grant to such service providers the right to access your user profile and Right(s) information in order to sell or transfer your Right(s).

Whenever you transfer an account balance to an Event Host we may be required to share your Personal Information with that Event Host to ensure the proper allocation of your account balance to the Event Host's accounting system.
==========
Under these circumstances, we cannot offer you the option to opt-out from having your information passed to the Event Host or other third party.
Event Hosts and other third parties are not subject to the provisions of this Policy, which means that they may use your Personal Information for purposes other than contacting you about the event you are going to attend, unless you contact them and request otherwise.
Our Service Providers
In order to process your requests we may provide your Personal Information to service providers or other companies who work on our behalf in order, for example, to process the transaction and deliver the tickets or other goods/services you have ordered.

Please contact these parties directly to exercise your right to opt out of any other communications you may receive from them.

Uppgifterna som du överför till oss kan användas till att informera dig om att du har vunnit, att bekräfta att ett pris har levererats eller till andra ändamål i samband med en pristävling.
==========
Ibland kan vi komma att publicera vissa av dina personuppgifter öppet på webbplatsen (mottagandet av ett pris kan t.ex.

Vi kommer emellertid aldrig att publicera dina personuppgifter på webbplatsen utan uttryckligt tillstånd från dig.
Ibland förekommer det att en tredje part driver eller leder en pristävling på webbplatsen och samlar in dina personuppgifter.
Vi driver eller leder inte pristävlingen eller lotteriet i sådana fall och har därmed ingen kontroll över vilka uppgifter som samlas in.
Därför är det viktigt att du läser integritetspolicyn för den tredje parten.

  Emellanåt kan vi begära att få uppgifter från dig via enkäter eller omröstningar som görs tillgängliga på eller via webbplatsen.

för att leverera information, produkter eller tjänster som du beställer, och för att fakturera dig, samt begränsa antalet biljetter som kan köpas per evenemang för att förhindra kreditkortsbedrägeri.
Detta kan inkludera informationsdelning med tredje part inklusive den transaktionsansvarige för kortbetalningar (för närvarande AXS Sweden AB, ett svenskregistrerat företag).
Du kan också få möjlighet att låta oss behålla dessa uppgifter i en personlig profil för dig så att du slipper skriva in den varje gång du gör ett köp.
För at skydda dig samlas sådan information in och sparas med hjälp av kryptering.
Vi vidarebefordrar endast finansiella uppgifter till tjänsteleverantörer om detta krävs för att kunna handlägga din beställning.
Chattrum, diskussionsforum och andra mötesplatser 
  Vi kan komma att ge våra användare tillgång till chattrum, diskussionsforum och andra mötesplatser.
Du behöver inte ange några personuppgifter när du använder sådana forum, med du kan välja att göra det själv.
Om du publicerar personuppgifter på internet blir de offentliga och du kan komma att få oönskade meddelanden från andra parter.
AXS Sweden AB kan inte garantera säkerheten för uppgifter som du väljer att offentliggöra i ett diskussionsforum.
Vi kan inte heller garantera att parter med tillgång till sådana offentligt tillgängliga uppgifter kommer att respektera din integritet.

Din interaktion med sådana funktioner styrs av integritetspolicyn för företaget som tillhandahåller dem.
Du kan logga in på vår webbplats med hjälp av inloggningstjänster som Facebook Connect, som bekräftar din identitet och ger dig möjlighet att förse oss med vissa personuppgifter, bl.a.
ditt namn och din e-postadress.
"Skicka till en vän"-meddelanden 
  Webbplatsen kan ge dig möjlighet att skicka information på webbplatsen via e-post, sociala nätverk, eller andra meddelandesystem, till mottagare som du anser kan vara intresserade av att få sådan information.
För att kunna använda den här funktionen måste du förse oss med viss information om mottagaren och när du gör det så bekräftar du samtidigt att du har mottagarens tillstånd att göra detta.
==========
Alla personuppgifter som du förmedlar när du skickar meddelandet till mottagaren, t.ex.
ditt namn och din e-postadress, kommer naturligtvis att vidarebefordras till mottagaren.
Vi kan av tekniska skäl behöva behålla mottagarens information i vårt system för leverans och loggning, men vi vidarebefordrar inte informationen till tredje part och använder den endast till att skicka detta enda meddelande och inte till något annat ändamål (såvida inte mottagaren redan har samtyckt till att hans/hennes personuppgifter används till annat ändamål).
==========
Mottagarna av dessa meddelanden förbinder sig inte att ta emot framtida meddelanden från AXS Sweden AB och/eller Outbox AXS-företag och/eller biljettleverantörer, såvida de inte tidigare har lämnat sitt samtycke när de har använt den här webbplatsen, och då i enlighet med deras önskemål avseende integritet och avsägande av sådana meddelanden.

==========
Vi kommer också att använda dem för analys av webbplatsens användning samt marknadsföring och kampanjer.

genom att visa annonser baserade på dina intressen, eller genom att identifiera erbjudanden och kampanjer som sannolikt är relevanta för dig.
Vi kan också  komma att använda dina personuppgifter till att sända dig information om relaterade produkter eller tjänster som kan vara intressanta för dig.

Vi kommer att vidarebefordra dina personuppgifter till vissa parter, beroende på i vilket syfte uppgifterna förmedlades, ditt samtycke då uppgifterna förmedlades och sammanhanget som uppgifterna förmedlades i. Avsnitten som följer beskriver hur detta sker.
Vi kräver av sådana tredje parter att de bara använder informationen för det ändamål den lämnades och vi kommer att ingå ett databehandlingsavtal i den utsträckning som det krävs enligt lag.
Vi kan komma att vidarebefordra dina personuppgifter till andra Outbox AXS-företag som också följer denna integritetspolicy, samt sponsorer för evenemang, arrangörer och arenor.
Om du ger ditt samtycke gäller följande: 

Vi kan komma att dela dina uppgifter med AEG-koncernen (inklusive Stockholm Live AB och Anschutz Entertainment Group Sweden AB)och AEG-koncernbolag i USA,  vilka kan använda dina personuppgifter för marknadsföring, kampanjer och liknande ändamål, 
Vi kan komma att vidarebefordra dina personuppgifter till våra partners eller andra betrodda tredje parter så att de kan använda dina personuppgifter till marknadsföring, marknadsundersökningar, kampanjer och liknande ändamål, samt, vid behov, bekräfta och fullgöra din beställning (t.ex.
genom att behandla ditt kreditkortsnummer eller kontonummer för betalning och skicka produkterna du har beställt och utbyta information med andra företag och organisation för att förhindra bedrägeri och minska kreditriskerna) inklusive den transaktionsansvarige för korthantering (för närvarande AXS Sweden AB (enligt definitionen ovan), vilket är ett registrerat svenskt bolag), 
Vi kan komma att skicka erbjudanden till dig från Outbox AXS-företag, dess filialer och våra kampanjpartners med utgångspunkt från uppgifterna som du förmedlat till oss.
