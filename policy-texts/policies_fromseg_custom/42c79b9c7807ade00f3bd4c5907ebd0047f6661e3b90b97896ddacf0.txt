Information Privacy Statement
Commitment to Privacy 
The University of Florida values individuals' privacy and actively seeks to preserve the privacy rights of those who share
	  information with us.
Your trust is important to us and we believe you have the right to know how information submitted to the
	  University of Florida is generally handled.
We provide the following privacy notice to define UF's information policy and practices, and to assist you in protecting your privacy.
Privacy Notice
The University has adopted the following privacy policies and practices for any and all parts of the University of Florida where Personal
	  Identification Information (PII) in any format is created, received, maintained, and transmitted.
However, in legal terms, it shall not be
	  construed as a contractual promise, and the University reserves the right to amend its policies at any time without notice.
Privacy and public
	  records obligations of the University are governed by applicable Florida statutes and U.S. federal laws.
This Privacy Statement speaks generally to the information created, received, maintained, and transmitted by and to official University of
	  Florida components.
==========
However, the amounts and types of information will vary from site to site within the University.
Therefore, in addition to
	  this general explanation of policy and practice, the university has published more specific privacy notices pertaining to personal information
	  associated exclusively with the internet, academics, finances, employment, and health care.
Thus it is wise for you to read the specific notices
	  to ensure you understand the privacy policies and practices applicable to a particular entity and the types of PII they maintain.

The Way We Use Information
As a general rule, UF maintains various types of records for individuals based upon their association with the University.
==========
We also analyze
	  aggregate information for resource management and planning purposes.
UF reserves the right to use information details about individuals to investigate
	  its resource management or security concerns.
Personal Identification Information is used to accurately compile, store, and retrieve an individual's records; to place and track individuals
	  appropriately for academic purposes, and to award academic degrees and honors; to properly employ individuals and compensate them for their work; to
	  correctly diagnose and medically treat individuals; to respond appropriately (or in a personalized format) to individuals' requests for services, and to
	  improve the University's services and products.
==========
Under Florida's Public Records Law, most records in our possession are subject to inspection by or disclosure to members of the public upon their request.
Information must be retained according to applicable federal and state laws, and must be available for inspection, unless otherwise exempt from the Public
	  Records Law.
We use the information you provide about yourself or about someone else when placing a request for service only to complete that order or request.
We do
	  not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request.
We generally use return addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses only to answer the communications we receive.
Such addresses are generally not
	  used for any other purpose and by university and state policy are not shared with outside parties, except in accordance with Public Record Laws.
==========
Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the purpose described without a clear notice
	  in advance and without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Providing Information is Your Choice
There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information to us.
However, most of our services and products will not be available to you without
	  the essential relevant information from you.
==========
Special Note: S668.6076, F.S. requires the University of Florida to post the following notice:
Under Florida law, email addresses are public records.
If you do not want your email address released in response to a public records request, do not
	  send electronic mail to the University.
Instead, contact the specific office or individual by phone or in writing.
==========
Our Commitment To Data Security
The University of Florida is dedicated to preventing unauthorized information access, maintaining information accuracy, and ensuring the appropriate use
	  of information.
We strive to put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to secure the information we collect in all formats:
	  on paper, electronically, and verbally.
These security practices are consistent with the policies of the university and with the laws and regulatory
	  practices of the State of Florida and multiple federal agencies.
