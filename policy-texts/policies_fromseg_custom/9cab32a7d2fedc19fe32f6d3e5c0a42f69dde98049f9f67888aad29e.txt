Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Where possible, our server automatically recognizes and collects certain non-personally identifiable information regarding visitors to the Site and users of the Services, including by way of example, IP address, browser type, and other information regarding the system and connection of each visitor or user.
We also collect information about how visitors access and use the Site and Services, including by way of example what pages of the Site are viewed and what portions of services are used.
This information allows us to improve the content of the Site and Services, facilitate research and analysis of the Site and Services, and develop and refine our Services.
Sometimes, we utilize the services of a third party to help us understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at all times in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form.
Other than improving the Site and Services, and the experience of visitors to the Site and users of the Services, we make no other use of this information.
==========
Disclosure as Required by Law.
Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of the Site or Services when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect SendGrid’s rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, SendGrid’s intellectual property rights.
In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.
==========
Enhancement of Personal Information.
We may combine and enhance our user database information with third party data and information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which we think our users would be interested.
Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings.
Individual personally identifiable information is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual user or resold for any purposes.
==========
Service Announcements.
On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements.
For instance, if the Site or any of the Services is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.
==========
Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.
These communications are not promotional in nature.
Special Offers and Updates.
==========
We may send new registrants of the Site or Services a welcoming email to verify password and username.
Established members may occasionally also receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters.
Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
==========
Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.
Your California Privacy Rights.
California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s personally identifiable information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.
SendGrid has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception.
==========
Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled "Choice and Opt-Out."
Choice and Opt-out.
We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails and other communications through the Site and Services.
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes.
If you are a user of the Site or Services and you no longer wish to receive emails, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your email address or postal address shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving email, mail or telephone calls from us or having your email address or postal address shared with third parties.
In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: info@sendgrid.com.

Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers.
In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, SendGrid may also contract with other third parties to provide various services to SendGrid relating to the Site or Services on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself.
For example, SendGrid may contract with a web site hosting provider to host all or a portion of the Site or Services for SendGrid.
By visiting the Site or using the Services, all visitors consent to SendGrid providing both personal and non-personal information received from those visitors to these third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to SendGrid.
In addition, all visitors consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their personal and non-personal information by SendGrid and these third party providers.

If we decide to change this Policy, we will either notify users by way of an e-mail or post material changes on the Site so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and if we disclose it.
Unless we seek and receive your consent, we will use information in accordance with the Policy under which the information was last collected.
Users may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by emailing us at info@sendgrid.com.
==========
Security.
We will use at least industry standard security measures on the Site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal information.
For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are granted access to that personally identifiable information.
Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
==========
Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
Contact Information.
All inquiries concerning this Policy and the Site or Services in general may be sent to info@sendgrid.com.
