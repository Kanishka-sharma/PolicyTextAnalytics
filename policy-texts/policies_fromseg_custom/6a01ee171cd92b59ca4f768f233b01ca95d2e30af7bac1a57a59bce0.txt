Fraud Prevention
We may use Personal Information, including voice print recordings, account information (such as purchase patterns) and device information for investigations or prevention of fraud or network abuse.
==========
We provide fraud prevention services to banks or other third parties.
As part of this service, we may verify your phone number to help those third parties prevent your personal information from being used for fraudulent purposes.
We also may provide the information you report as spam to 7726 to a third party to prevent fraud or network abuse, and we may share such information with government agencies and others that work to combat spam and prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices.
==========
Information Collected from Cookies
We may also use information collected from cookies or other similar technologies to improve our websites, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request.
Marketing
We may use information we collect to contact you about T-Mobile or third-party products, services, and offers that we believe you may find of interest.
We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or other methods.
You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time as outlined below in Choices Regarding Use of Your Information.
Directories
We do not publish directories of our customers' wireless numbers; nor will we provide or make such numbers available to third-parties for listing in their public directories, without the customer’s prior consent.
==========
Performance, Diagnostics & Management
We collect information about devices, our network and WiFi usage to perform diagnostic analyses and understand how your device is performing overall.
Diagnostic data helps us troubleshoot technical issues related to your device’s performance such as battery life, dropped calls, processing speed, device memory, service coverage, and network and WiFi signal strength that you and other customers may experience.
If you are using a device in WiFi mode, we may collect information about that usage, such as the routing address and IP address.
We also may use diagnostic data to identify and recommend products and services.
==========
Location-Based Services
We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your general location.
We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm.
Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance, Find My Device, or search results, etc.).
==========
These data services, known as Location-Based Services ("LBS") are made available by us and others, usually via applications.
These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources.
These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite ("GPS"), Assisted GPS ("AGPS"), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance, or search results, etc.)
LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data.
==========
Where we allow third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our network, we require those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this statement.
It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another entity.
You should carefully review the privacy statements and other terms of third-parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people.
Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent.
==========
You will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared (except in the case of certain parental controls or similar services associated with enterprise or multi-line accounts – for example, T-Mobile’s FamilyWhereTM services – which may be managed solely by the primary account holder or their designee, but always with notice to the end-user).
T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available here.

We may also use such data for any of the other purposes listed in this statement, such as internal analysis, or to personalize offers we provide to you.
