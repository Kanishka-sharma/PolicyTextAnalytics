Last update: 09/15/2019
Your personal information on Nicequest
Your participation on Nicequest is voluntary and the legal basis that legitimises our handling of your personal information is the consent you provide us with through accepting this Privacy Policy.
==========
There are three basic types of personal information that we may collect about you:

Information you fill in yourself.
The information we collect about you through computer applications.
The information about you that third parties provide us with.
==========
Information you fill in yourself
To register on Nicequest and take part in our community, we may ask you for:

You contact details, for example: your email address, your home address, your full name, or your telephone number.
Your opinions and demographic profile: by responding to our surveys you will be sending us information about your demographic profile, such as your sex, age and financial and family information.
You will also take part in opinion surveys about your social preferences and habits.
==========
Information we collect about you through computer applications
If you access to download or use the computer applications we suggest to you, you will allow us to gather information about your devices, automatically, without you having to do anything.
For example:

Your fingerprint: our technology enables us to find out the ‘fingerprint’ of the devices you use (PC, telephone, etc.).
The ‘fingerprint’ is a way of identifying a device accurately.
==========
Your image: in some surveys we will ask you to give permission so that we (or our clients) can record your reactions to certain stimulus (music, advertisements, videos, etc.).
Your image will only be used for research purposes and will not be revealed publicly.
The identifier of your devices: the devices you connect to the internet from usually have an internal code which identifies them.
Like its registration number.
==========
Your geographical position: we will use this to locate you on a map and know what people in your area think or what your habits are.
Information about what websites you visit and their contents.
In particular, we may save the websites you visit with your browser, and their source code (html).
Information about the applications you use on your mobile devices.
Information about the words you put into search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing...).
Information about your multi-media use (series, radio, television, streaming content, etc.).
==========
Information about you that third parties provide us with
If you are a user or customer of one of our partners, through collaboration agreements with them we may add the information they have about you to our data bases.
For what purposes do we use your information?
==========
Netquest’s mission as a company is social and market research.
At Netquest we are not dedicated to digital advertising.
Our aim as a company is to help other companies to carry out statistical analysis of consumer behaviour.
We are not dedicated to internet sales or direct marketing.
==========
In this sense, we will use the information we process about you for the following purposes:

Firstly so that you can take part in our community and so that we and our clients can communicate with you.
To send gifts to your home when you request them.
==========
Also to prevent fraud (for one person to take part more than once in a survey) or to check that you have really taken part in a specific study.
In general, the information we have about you will enable us to invite you to take part in projects that best suit your consumer profile.
==========
The information you provide us with will also be used for us or our clients to improve the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.
For example, our clients may develop advertising campaigns orientated towards individuals with a social profile similar to yours.
==========
Who do you share my personal information with?
In general, we will not share your personal information with third parties.
==========
For example, we will send your responses to the surveys you take part in or your digital behaviour data to our clients linked to your unique collaborator identifier, but they will not include your identifying information.
What interests us and our clients are your opinions and your behaviour to anonymously add them to the many other collaborators and thereby create aggregated statistics.
Your unique collaborator identifier is a code we assign to you when you register on Nicequest.
It consists of a sequence of letters and numbers.
Its purpose is, specifically, to identify you within Nicequest and protect your identity to third parties at the same time.
==========
It is useful in the internal organisation of the information and coordination with clients.
By accepting this Privacy Policy, you accept that we can share your unique identifier with our clients.
Eventually we will collaborate with different clients and suppliers who will need to access or receive your personal information.

Netquest may provide your profile information linked to a cookie or a unique identifier so that third parties can carry out audience measurement studies or analysis of the effectiveness of advertising.
==========
On occasion, if you are invited to take part in pharmaceutical studies and you declare you have suffered adverse effects, clients may contact you to examine in more detail this adverse effect for the purpose of public health.
