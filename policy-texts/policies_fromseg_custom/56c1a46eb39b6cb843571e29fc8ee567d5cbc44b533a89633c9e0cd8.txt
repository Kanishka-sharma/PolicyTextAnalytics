Automatic Renewal.
Paid accounts are subscriptions.
This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis.
==========
Your Jotform subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle until you cancel your Jotform subscription by selecting the starter plan on the billing page.
You can also cancel your Jotform subscription by submitting a request to the Jotform Support Team.
If you downgrade, your account will remain at your current plan through the end of your current billing cycle.
==========

Cancellation.
==========
Paid plans are subscriptions that auto-renew by default.

To cancel your Jotform subscription at any time, go to the Billing section of your account, and downgrade your account to the free Starter plan.
If you’re logged into your account, you can simply click Downgrade below the Starter option on the pricing page.
You can delete your account entirely by clicking Delete My Account on your Account Settings page.
Canceling auto-renew prevents your payment method from being charged at your next billing date, or if you pay by invoice, prevents your next invoice from being issued.
Your current subscription (the time you already paid for) isn’t affected, so you’ll continue to be able to access and benefit from paid features until the plan downgrades on your next billing date.

If for any reason you decide to cancel your account within 30 days of your payment, you will be issued a refund for the full amount.
