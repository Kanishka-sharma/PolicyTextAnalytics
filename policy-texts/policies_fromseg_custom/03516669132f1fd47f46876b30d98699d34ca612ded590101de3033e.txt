		Our AccuWeather Sites use technologies such as Cookies, Pixel Tags, Web
		Beacons, Flash Shared Objects, HTML local storage or HTML mini databases
		to help improve your experience.
These AccuWeather Sites include our
		websites, mobile applications and other digital products.
These technologies are small data files that are placed on your device.
The names and types of these technologies change from time to time.
==========
In
		this policy, we may refer to the specific names or we may simply use the
		term "cookies" to describe them.
Cookies serve a number of purposes.
We use them:
	

to provide you a better, faster and safer experience

			to help us find out what parts of the site your device last visited, so
			we can deliver content that is most relevant to you
		

			to provide advertising, which enables us to provide many of our
			AccuWeather Sites free of charge or at low rates
		

			to analyze and optimize the performance of our AccuWeather Sites
		


		Below are examples of some commonly used cookie technologies.
Cookies are files with small amounts of data,
			which may include an anonymous unique identifier.
If you are accessing
			an AccuWeather Site through a browser, including a browser on a mobile
			device, cookies may be sent to the browser and stored in the
			device's memory.
This identifies the device the next time it
			accesses an AccuWeather Site through a browser.
==========
Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Flash Shared Objects/HTML5 Local
				Storage/HTML5 Mini Databases.
Many mobile devices use these technologies which allow for the
			storage of information on the mobile devices and, in effect, allow the
			enhancement of internet browsing.
Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local
			Storage and HTML5 Mini Databases also allow the device to track a
			user's web browsing movements across the internet and not just on
			one particular website.
==========
Some cookies are "first party cookies" that come directly from
		us.
Some cookies are "third party cookies" that come from
		third-party providers who help us operate our AccuWeather Sites, who serve
		advertisements to your device when you use AccuWeather Sites.
Some
		third-party cookies also may come from third-party providers whose content
		is embedded in an AccuWeather Site or accessed through an AccuWeather
		Site.
==========
You can instruct the browser on the device, or other settings on the
		device to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, if you do not permit the device to accept cookies, your
		experience may not be optimal when you return because we may not recognize
		the device.
For example, if we do not recognize a device, we may require
		you to re-enter a location you have saved for convenience or re-enter a
		password.
You also can opt out of receiving cookies by visiting
