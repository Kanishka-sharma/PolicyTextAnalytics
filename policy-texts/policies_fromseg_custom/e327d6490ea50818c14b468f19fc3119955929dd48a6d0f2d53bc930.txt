Your California Privacy Rights
(as provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83).
When California customers provide personal information to a business, they have the right to request certain disclosures if that business shares personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
Once per calendar year the customer may request that the business provide a list of companies with which it shares personal information for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories of personal information that the business shares.
Instead of responding to such requests, however, a company may choose to comply with this law by establishing and publishing on its website a policy of not disclosing a customer's personal information to such third parties unless the customer affirmatively agrees to such disclosures, or a policy of not disclosing a customer's personal information to such third parties if the customer has exercised an option that prevents that information from being disclosed to third parties for those purposes.
Thus, a company may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
As stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
==========
If Epson should decide to change this policy in the future, you will be provided an opportunity to opt in or out of any such sharing.
EPSON may still share your information with third parties for many other purposes, such as product safety, customer service, and EPSON's own marketing.
You cannot prevent sharing for these other purposes.
==========
California customers may request information about our compliance with this law by using the Privacy Feedback form, which will send an email to the appropriate Privacy Coordinator.
Any such inquiry must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description.
Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this Privacy Feedback form.
