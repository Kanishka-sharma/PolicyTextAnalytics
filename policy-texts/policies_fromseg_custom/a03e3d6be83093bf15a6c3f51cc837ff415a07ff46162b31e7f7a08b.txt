For example, you may decide to purchase a license  to a number of Symantec software products online in a downloadable format by  way of Electronic Software Delivery (ESD) or in a CD format from one of Symantec’s  authorized online resellers.

==========
Furthermore, in order to manage  purchases and license renewals by Symantec customers, Symantec will need to  share your personal information with a billing system service provider.
Such  service provider will process data of Symantec’s customers only on behalf of  Symantec.
(These examples are not exhaustive, and may change from time to  time).
==========
We require that all such contractors keep the  personal information of our customers secure and confidential.
We have  contractually bound third parties to such restrictions and require that these  contractors provide for appropriate technical and organizational measures to  secure the data, that they use personal information only on behalf of Symantec  and that they do not share personal information with others or use your  personal information for their own marketing purposes.
5.4   Legal DisclosuresPlease be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for Symantec to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by applicable law.
No personally identifiable information will be disclosed to any law enforcement agency or governmental agency except in response to:
A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction;
A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for information, in that Symantec would be in breach of local law were it to refuse to provide such information, and it or its officers, executive or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process, provided there is a legal basis to do so, or,
Where such disclosure is necessary for Symantec to enforce its legal rights pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction from which such information was gathered, and there is a legal basis to do so.
We have taken appropriate security measures, consistent with  international information practices, to protect your personal information.
==========
These measures include, on our web sites and Internet-enabled technologies, administrative,  technical, physical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse,  unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction.
These  measures include:
Physical safeguards, such as locked doors  and file cabinets, controlled access to our facilities, and secure destruction  of media containing personal information;
Technology safeguards, such as  use of Symantec anti-virus and endpoint protection software, encryption, and  monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure compliance with our  security policies, and in particular, credit card information is transmitted  using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption;
Organizational safeguards, through  training and awareness programs on security and privacy, to ensure employees  understand the importance and means by which they must protect personal  information, as well as through privacy policies and policy standards that  govern how Symantec treats personal information.7.1   Non-Personal Information We CollectWe collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when users  visit our web sites.
Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to  a single, identifiable visitor.
==========
It tells us information such as how many users  visited our sites and the pages accessed.
By collecting this information, we  learn how to best tailor our web sites to our visitors.
We collect this information either through “cookie” technology or with  “web beacons,” as explained above.7.4   Web Site TrafficThrough our various tracking methods discussed above and using log files, we may track domain names, IP addresses, and browser types from people who visit our site.
We use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout Symantec’s Web site.
==========
Such information is not correlated with any personal information.
Symantec collects and retains, for a limited period of time, internet protocol (IP) address information, of its customers, for the following purposes:
subscription and registration,
to provide technical support;
to obtain geolocation information;
and to secure our networks and systems.
IP addresses collected by Symantec are primarily traffic data, which is  not necessarily personal information.
Symantec does not have the means to  reasonably and authoritatively link an IP address to an identifiable  individual.
Registration of a product does create a unique computer identifier,  which is linked to an IP address at the time of registration; however, IP  addresses are usually assigned dynamically and therefore are temporary, and may  be behind network address translation, and are often capable of falsification  (spoofing).
