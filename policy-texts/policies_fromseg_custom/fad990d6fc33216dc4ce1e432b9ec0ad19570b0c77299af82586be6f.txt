FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT NETWORK MANAGEMENT
Sprint is committed to  providing the best wireless broadband Internet access service experience  possible for all of its customers.
To ensure that all Sprint customers enjoy  the best possible network experience, Sprint uses reasonable network management  practices that are consistent with industry standards.
Sprint also prohibits  certain wireless data customers from engaging in certain data uses.
Information  concerning these prohibited uses can be found in our point-of-sale materials  and online in our Important Service Terms located at sprint.com.
==========
The following  Frequently Asked Questions are intended to help clarify for Sprint’s retail  customers what Sprint means by network management and explain Sprint’s (and its  providers’) network management techniques and approaches.
Why does Sprint manage  its network?
Sprint manages its  network with the goal of delivering the best possible wireless broadband  Internet access experience to all of its customers.
Wireless network resources  are not infinite.
Managing the network is essential to promote the use and  enjoyment of wireless data by all of our customers.
==========
We use reasonable network  management practices that are consistent with industry standards.
Just as the  Internet continues to change and evolve, so too, will our network management  practices to address the challenges and threats on the Internet.
If Sprint didn’t manage  its network, our customers would be subject to the negative effects of spam,  viruses, security attacks, network congestion, and other risks and degradations  of the service.
By engaging in reasonable and responsible network management, Sprint  can deliver the best possible broadband Internet access experience to all of  its customers.
==========
How does Sprint manage  its network?
Sprint uses various  tools and techniques to manage its network, deliver its service and ensure  compliance with its prohibited network use and related requirements, which are  available in Sprint point-of-sale materials and online at sprint.com/termsandcondtions.
These tools and techniques are dynamic, like the Sprint network  and its usage, and Sprint may update the tools and techniques it uses.
Sprint’s  network management activities may include identifying spam and preventing its  delivery to customers, detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing the  distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content, and using other tools  and techniques to deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to  all of its customers.
Does network management  change over time?
Yes.
The wireless  industry is highly dynamic.
As the Internet and related technologies continue  to evolve and advance, Sprint’s network management tools will evolve and keep  pace to allow Sprint to deliver an excellent, reliable and safer online  experience to all of our customers.
We will provide updates here and in other  appropriate locations if we make important or significant changes to our  network management techniques that impact customers.
==========
How does congestion  management work?
Network bandwidth isn’t  infinite.
In times of network congestion, the network segment or sector  impacted doesn’t have enough bandwidth to fully serve all customers requesting  it.
The network is designed to  dynamically allocate available bandwidth in a way that is fair to all  users.
The fairness algorithms below  describe the approach.
==========
The resulting  impact to end user experience is that the user may temporarily experience  slower-than-normal data speeds until the congestion has passed.
On the Sprint 3G network, a  third generation network that follows the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)  standard, Sprint uses a proportional fairness scheduler algorithm that  allocates network resources based on radio frequency signal quality and other  metrics.
During times of congestion, the proportional fairness scheduler  algorithm ensures no one user is deprived of network resources.
On the Sprint 4G network, a fourth generation network that  follows the WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) standard, Sprint  may periodically measure a user’s bandwidth usage on a specific network segment  or sector, as well as measure the overall bandwidth usage for all users on that  segment or sector.
At times when an individual user is  consuming high amounts of bandwidth and at the same time the overall bandwidth is  being used by all users on that network segment or sector  at high levels, Sprint 4G customers may experience  a temporary adjustment in available network resources until the conditions for  network congestion have passed.
==========
Sprint is continually  upgrading networks.
These network upgrades may include revised or improved  tools and techniques to manage network congestion and ensure that all users  have appropriate access to the network in times of congestion.
Does congestion  management target peer-to-peer ("P2P") or other applications or make  decisions about the content of my traffic?
No.
==========
However, Sprint’s terms and conditions prohibit some uses of Internet access.
Sprint reserves the right to take action when customers violate these terms and  conditions including blocking the traffic, slowing the customer’s effective  data speeds, or discontinuing a customer’s service.
Below is the prohibit data  use portion of the terms and conditions: 

Sprint data  services are provided solely for purposes of web surfing, sending and receiving  email, photographs and other similar messaging activities, and the  noncontinuous streaming of videos, downloading of files or online gaming.
P2P  and other uses that may adversely affect our network are not permitted on  Sprint’s network.
Our wireless broadband Internet access services may not be  used: (i) to generate excessive amounts of Internet traffic through the  continuous, unattended streaming, downloading or uploading of videos or other  files or to operate hosting services including, but not limited to, web or  gaming hosting; (ii) to maintain continuous active network connections to the  Internet, such as through a web camera or machine-to-machine connections that  do not involve active participation by a person; (iii) to disrupt email use by  others using automated or manual routines, including, but not limited to  “auto-responders” or cancel bots or other similar routines; (iv) to transmit or  facilitate any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, telemarketing,  promotional materials, “junk  mail,”  unsolicited commercial or bulk email, or fax; (v) for activities adversely  affecting the ability of other people or systems to use either Sprint’s  wireless services or other parties’ Internet-based resources, including, but  not limited to, “denial of service” (DoS) attacks against another network host  or individual user; (vi) for an activity that connects any device to Personal  Computers (including without limitation, laptops), or other equipment for the  purpose of transmitting wireless data over the network (unless customer is  using a plan designated for such usage); or (vi) for any other reason that, in  our sole discretion violates our policy of providing service for individual  use.
==========
How does congestion management  impact me and my use data services?
Most customers will notice  no change in their wireless data experience due to Sprint’s congestion  management.
If a user notices it at all, congestion management will be  experienced as a slowness of data speeds compared to their normal experience.
The goal of congestion management is to enable all users to have access to a  fair share of the network at peak times, when congestion occasionally occurs.
How often does Sprint  expect to use congestion management?
Because of the peaked  nature of wireless data traffic, congestion management software is actively  looking for network congestion at all times.
==========
When it detects congestion, the fairness algorithms described above allocate  available bandwidth to the users requesting services in an attempt to provide  the best possible service to all users and to ensure that no user is starved of  bandwidth.
Sprint monitors how  user traffic is affected by congestion management and makes adjustments as reasonably  necessary to ensure that our wireless data users have a high-quality wireless  broadband Internet access experience.
Sprint also evaluates its overall network  performance and enhances its network by adding capacity or making other network  adjustments to address congestion and performance issues.
How much bandwidth would  I have to consume to trigger Sprint’s network management?
==========
For example, how many  movies would I have to download to be affected by congestion management?
Since congestion  management is dynamic and works in real time, the answer depends on a number of  factors including overall usage, time of day, and the number of customers trying  to use wireless data on a given tower.
First, the local tower must be  approaching a congested state before congestion management algorithms activate.
==========
On Sprint’s 3G CDMA network, the proportional fairness scheduler algorithm  ensures no one user is deprived of network resources.
On the Sprint 4G WiMAX  network, when a user is consuming high amounts of bandwidth and the overall bandwidth  being used on that network segment or sector is being used at high levels, Sprint  4G customers experience a temporary adjustment in available network resources  until the conditions for network congestion have passed.
Just as on our 3G  network, users during peak congestion might find certain high data usage applications,  such as streaming video, could be temporarily interrupted to ensure that other  users have access to the network.
The point of the  technique is to deliver the best overall online experience possible.
The  technique should help ensure that all customers get their fair share of  bandwidth resources to enjoy all that the Internet has to offer and that  includes surfing the web, reading email, downloading movies, watching streaming  video, gaming or listening to music.
==========
How will customers know  they are being managed?
In general, users won’t  know when congestion management algorithms are being used.
Wireless networks are shared resource  networks meaning that customers on a specific cell site share the available  bandwidth at the site.
Congestion management algorithms are active in the  network 100 percent of the time to allocate available bandwidth to users in a  way that benefits all users on the network.
Does congestion  management apply to both Sprint 3G and 4G services?
Yes.
How does congestion  management relate to the various monthly data usage thresholds?
==========
They are two separate  issues.
Congestion management works to optimize the experience of all  users in the congested area.
It works independent of any caps or overage  charges that may apply based on the user’s price plan and monthly usage.
Do Sprint labeled products  such as Sprint Football Live or NASCAR Sprint Cup MobileSM have  precedent over other applications?
No.
==========
They are treated  just like any other data application on the network and traffic from these  applications is subject to the same congestion management controls as any other  Internet traffic.
Does Sprint  discriminate against particular types of online content?
No.
==========
Sprint strives to  deliver to its customers access to all the lawful , legitimate and  non-infringing content that the Internet has to offer.
However, we are  committed to protecting customers from spam, phishing and other unwanted or  harmful online content and activities.
Sprint uses industry standard tools and  generally accepted best practices and policies to help it meet this customer  commitment.
==========
In cases where these tools and policies identify certain online  content as harmful and unwanted, such as spam or phishing websites, this  content is usually prevented from reaching customers.
In other cases, these  tools and policies may permit customers to identify certain content that is not  clearly harmful or unwanted, such as bulk email or websites with questionable  security ratings, and enable those customers to inspect the content further if  they want to do so.
Does Sprint employ network security practices in addition  to the congestion management technique?
Yes.
==========
Sprint uses normal industry security  practices to protect the Sprint network elements from unauthorized access and  attack.
Does Sprint have rules  regarding the attachment of devices to its network by customers?
Yes.
Only  Sprint-approved devices may be used on the Sprint network.
