Your Credit Card safety
There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet 
  so we decided to go one better than most sites and use the Royal Bank of Scotland 
  plc secure server.
They encrypt your credit or debit card information and authorise 
  payment.
This means that your credit card details are never revealed to us.
For additional protection we also have our own secure server which is used to 
  encrypt your name and address information.
We have never had a single reported 
  case of fraudulent card use from any of our customers.
