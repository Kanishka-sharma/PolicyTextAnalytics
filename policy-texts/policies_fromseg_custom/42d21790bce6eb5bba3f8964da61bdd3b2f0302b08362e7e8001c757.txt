Comet Systems Commitment to User Privacy
Comet Systems takes its responsibility towards user privacy very seriously.
In fact, Comet is committed not only to our users' privacy but to their anonymity.
In the course of downloading the Comet Cursor, you are never asked to provide your name or email address 
      or any other personally identifiable information.
This makes Comet different from most other software 
      companies, who routinely ask for names and email addresses.
Because we do not handle any personally 
      identifiable information, people who use the Comet Cursor remain anonymous.
==========
Many people are concerned about ad networks profiling and tracking people's online surfing habits.
Comet Systems doesn't profile Comet Cursor users or track user habits, and never has.
Comet Systems does not sell or share any 
      information about Comet Cursor users with third parties.
All we do is count the numbers of cursors displayed 
      at our partner sites in an anonymous fashion.
And since you don't ever tell us your email address, you cannot 
      get spammed from downloading our software.
Some inaccurate information appeared in late 1999 regarding our information practices.
==========
Many of those publications have since issued retractions or corrections, including the Christian Science Monitor, Industry Standard, ABC News, PC Magazine, ZDNet, Time Digital, and Business Week.
We thank these publications for reconsidering their stories in light of the facts, and hope that all members of the press and public will take privacy issues as seriously as we do at Comet Systems.
