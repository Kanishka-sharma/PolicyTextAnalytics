Thank you for visiting http://seekingalpha.com (together with all other websites operated by Seeking Alpha, Ltd., the "Site").
Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at the Site.
This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use.
1.
==========
Introduction We are committed to respecting your online privacy, and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.
Currently, we do not require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on our Site.
However, in order to provide you with some of the Site's services, you must create a profile, register and provide your email address, username, password and other specified information.
At a later time, you may add additional Personal Information to your profile.
==========
If you are a registered user, you will have your own Seeking Alpha email account ("Seeking Alpha Email Account").
By using your Seeking Alpha Email Account, you may send messages to and receive messages from other registered users and contributors.
You are strictly prohibited from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertisements, spam, chain letters, etc.
Any information that you send within such a message is visible only to the message recipients.
==========
Please note that some actions you take, such as replying to a topic, posting comments, etc. may subscribe you automatically to getting notifications to your Seeking Alpha email account.
Please further note that some notifications, such as a notification for receiving a private message to your Seeking Alpha email account, may be enabled by default.
We may use your email address and Seeking Alpha email account to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our services, and those of our advertisers who may have relevant offers.
You may choose not to receive email from a particular sender by rolling your mouse over the text of an email in your Seeking Alpha email account and blocking that sender.
If you receive the email from Seeking Alpha in an email account other than your Seeking Alpha email account and wish to block that sender, simply go into your Seeking Alpha email account and block that sender in the same way.
Furthermore, if you do not wish to receive email from one of our advertisers, you may unsubscribe from receiving further email from that advertiser.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Site, we may transfer that Personal Information within Seeking Alpha or to Seeking Alpha's third-party service providers, but only to provide services on the Site, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
==========
Seeking Alpha strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy.
Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Seeking Alpha intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information.
In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.
Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Site and its services (including via your Seeking Alpha email account) if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, ii) enforce our Terms of Service including investigations of potential violations thereof, iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues, or iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Seeking Alpha, its users, yourself or the public.
