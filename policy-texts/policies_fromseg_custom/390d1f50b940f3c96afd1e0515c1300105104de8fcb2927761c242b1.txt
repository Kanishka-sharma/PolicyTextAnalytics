All of the Survey Response Metadata, with the exception of your IP address (covered below), may be provided and/or sold to 3rd parties, such as the Company’s customers.

We do not store your IP address in raw form after your session completes, and it is never shared with 3rd parties.
==========
We do not run surveys across our Network that ask for any Personally Identifiable Information via a survey question.

Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Network and help us analyze Network usage more accurately.
For instance, our Network may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to bypass engaging with a survey due to your previous completion of a survey.

On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar.

==========
Additionally, Upwave and its partners may collect data through owned and operated mobile applications using a pseudonymized identifier, for each mobile device, known as a mobile advertising ID (“MAID”).
Each MAID allows us to identify unique mobile device, although the User can reset their MAID at any given time resulting in the delinking of device and MAID.
These MAIDs perform a similar role to cookies on our network, except within the context of mobile apps, rather than websites.
