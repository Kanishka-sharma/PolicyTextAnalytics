If you have questions about this Platform Privacy Policy, please email contact@deepintent.com.
This Platform Privacy Policy does not govern the collection and use of data on our website (www.deepintent.com) and sites or mobile applications that are managed by our platform members, which will each have their own privacy policies and practices.
We encourage you to refer to the Website Privacy Policy found here and each platform members’ respective privacy policies for information about such data collection and use practices.
Overview of Platform Services
DeepIntent is an online marketing and advertising technology platform specializing in audience insights and media buying (“Platform”).
Through our Platform, advertisers (“Clients”) can place advertisements on websites, mobile apps, and other digital media properties (“Partner Properties”) belonging to publishers with whom we are partnered (“Partners”).
Our Platform uses data and technology to help Clients strategize and market their products and/or services via the Partner Properties that fit your interests at the most relevant moments to you (“Services”).
Information We Collect, Store, and/or Access
When you visit a Partner Property, we collect certain information about you and your Device.
Note that some of this information (such as IP addresses and other unique identifiers) may be considered “personal data” according to applicable data privacy law in the EEA.
==========
The information we collect may include the following:
Information about Your Browser.
This includes information about your browser type, browser language, browser settings, and our cookie information.
Information about Your Device.
This includes information about your IP address, device type, device operating system, device make and model, device identifiers such as your IDFA (identifier for advertisers), MAID (mobile advertising identifier) or AAID (android advertising identifier), including through mobile applications and across multiple devices that you may use.
==========
Information about Your Interactions with Partner Properties.
This includes information about the Partner Properties you visited or used, the date and time of such visits to Partner Properties, and geolocation (including city, state, country, zip code, and in some instances, geographic coordinates).
==========
We only receive and collect this information from requests sent by our Partners to fill a Partner Property with an ad, to track your activity in connection with showing you an ad, or to place our unique identifier (“UID”) or other identifiers associated with your browser or Device.
We then use this information through our Platform to help decide whether to serve you an ad, to measure your interaction with an ad, and to help Clients serve more relevant ads to you.
Information about Your Interactions with Ads.
This includes information about the type of ad served to you, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on the ad, and whether you downloaded the ad’s app.
==========
Inferences About You.
This information includes your interests or demographic information (your age or gender).
==========
We do not directly collect this information from you, but sync this information provided by third-party data management platforms to our Platform and UIDs to help our Clients serve more relevant advertisements to you.
Information You Share with our Vendors.
This information may include offline data about you, such as your name or email, that you allowed our Vendors to share with us for advertising purposes.

We may sync this information with any other information we collect about you.
Information about Your Internet Service.
We collect information about your Device’s Internet Service Provider (ISP).
==========
Information Collected by Third Parties
Our Clients, Partners, Vendors (as defined below), and each of their third-party service providers (collectively, “Third Parties”) may use their own or their affiliates’ cookies, web beacons, and/or other internet technology within ads and on the Partner Properties.
For example, when you click on an ad served on a Partner Property, both our Client and Partner may drop their own cookies to collect information about you.
==========
We do not control the information collection and usage practices of these Third Parties.
Therefore, we recommend that you review the terms and privacy policy on such Third Parties’ websites.
==========
How We Collect Information
We use cookies, scripts, web beacons, and/or other similar technology to help us understand your digital actions when you visit a Partner Property on your Device.
For example, when you interact with ads presented on our Partner Properties, cookies on such Partner Properties allow us to collect information, like your IP address or other device identifiers, from your Device.
We also receive other data (e.g., demographic information) from Third Party data management platforms that separately collect and use your information from visits to various websites or applications to create “segments” – groups of users that are inferred to share similar interests.
We may use information about your inclusion in specific segments based on Client requests so that they may serve more relevant ads to you.
You can see a representative sample of our custom health segments here.
