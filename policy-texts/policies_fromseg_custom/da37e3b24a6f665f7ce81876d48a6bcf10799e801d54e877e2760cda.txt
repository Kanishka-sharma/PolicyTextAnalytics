Shipments are processed by Farfetch's partner carriers.
For orders above the threshold**, we offer a flat delivery fee regardless of the number of boutiques you order from.
The flat delivery fee is based on the lowest price shipping option available for the item in your order that travels the farthest to get to you.
You may also choose an expedited shipping method at checkout such as DHL Express or Same Day Delivery for an additional fee.
From time to time we offer promotional shipping rates that will not be reflected in this table.

Why don't you have the item I ordered?

How can I expect to receive the goods?
All orders will be delivered in Farfetch packaging, which will protect your items and ensure that they reach you in perfect condition.

When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms and Conditions, they have specific meanings (these are known as 'defined terms').
You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence).
Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of the Terms and Conditions where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).

We have used headings to help you understand these Terms and Conditions and to easily locate information.
These Terms and Conditions are only available in the English language.
We will not file copies of the contracts between us and you relating to our supply of the Services, or between you and the Partner Boutiques relating to the sale of the products, so we recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms and Conditions for your records (but please note that we may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time so please check the Website regularly, and each time you use the Services to order products, to ensure you understand the legal terms which apply at that time).

We do not in any way exclude or limit our liability for:
(a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence;
(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;
(c) any other liability which cannot be limited by law.

The products
We attempt to be as accurate as possible in the description of the products.
However, as the descriptions are based on information provided to us by the Partner Boutiques, we cannot guarantee that any descriptions are totally accurate, complete, reliable or error-free.
The images of the products on the Website are for illustrative purposes only.
Although we attempt to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display of the colours accurately reflects the colour of the products.
We do not allow Partner Boutiques to offer flawed products or products of lower quality than the corresponding market standards for sale on the Website.
If products you have ordered are not as described, flawed or of a lower quality than the corresponding market standards, you can return them to us and we will liaise with the Partner Boutique on your behalf and you will receive a full refund of the price of the defective product, any applicable delivery charges and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the products (we will advise you whether the products will be collected from you or whether you need to arrange for them to be returned).
==========
Please see section 10 below for details of how to return products to us.
As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to products that are faulty or not as described.

Orders, prices and payment
The steps you need to take to place an order are explained in the "How to Order & Pay" section of our How to Shop page.
By completing the check-out process and placing an order, you are offering to purchase the products from the relevant Partner Boutiques (and not directly from us).
Your order for the products is subject to these Terms and Conditions which are incorporated into the contract between you and the relevant Partner Boutique.
All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price.
To order products you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card (please see section (c) below for details of acceptable payment methods).
By placing an order, you are promising that all details you provide are true and accurate, that you are over 18 years of age, that you are an authorised user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds in the account to cover the cost of your order.
==========
The Website allows you to check your order and correct any errors before sending it.
Please take the time to read and check your order at each page of the order process as you are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate (for example, the correct products, quantities, size, colour, etc.).
(a) Formation of the contract between you and the Partner Boutique(s)
The identity of the Partner Boutique is shown on the product page of the relevant products, in your basket when the products are added and on the order confirmation page when you place an order.
When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement email confirming receipt of your order.
This email is only an acknowledgement for information purposes and it does not constitute acceptance of your order by the Partner Boutique.
The contract between you and the Partner Boutique in relation to the products will not be formed until we have checked that the Partner Boutique accepts your order.
==========
If the Partner Boutique accepts your order, we will send you an email confirming this.
The confirmation email sent by us on behalf of the Partner Boutique concludes the contract with you.
The confirmation email will include a description of the products included in the order and certain other information about your rights to cancel the contract between you and the Partner Boutique (please see section 10 below for further information on your rights to cancel the contract).
Only those products listed in the confirmation email are included in the contract between you and the Partner Boutique.
(b) Pricing and availability
Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices that appear on the Website are accurate, as this information is provided to us by the Partner Boutiques, there may be cases where errors occur.
If we discover an error in the price of any products that you have ordered, we will inform you of this as soon as possible and, acting on behalf of the Partner Boutique, give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it.
If we are unable to contact you, your order will be treated as cancelled.
If you cancel and you have already paid for the products, you will receive a full refund.

If you are viewing the Website from the UK or a country in Europe, the prices advertised on the Website for products from Partner Boutiques within Europe are inclusive of VAT.
Delivery costs are not included in the prices and will be charged in addition.
The delivery costs will vary depending on the products that you have ordered and your delivery address.

==========
If you are shipping items from a Partner Boutique outside of your territory, you may need to pay import duties upon receipt of the products.
We will notify you during the checkout process if import duties are included or you may have to pay them upon receipt of the products.
If they are not included, neither we nor the Partner Boutiques have any control over these charges and we cannot predict their amount.
You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes that are not included.
==========
Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.
Additional information is also available in the "Duties and Taxes" section of our Orders and Shipping page.
Please note that in the event you return an item, the import duties will be refunded if they were originally included in the purchase price.
If they were not included then you will be responsible for reclaiming duty directly from your local customs office.
==========
(c) Payment
Please see the "What payment methods does the website accept?"
section of our FAQs for details of what payment methods can be used.
When you submit your order, we carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your payment card on behalf of the relevant Partner Boutiques.
Products will not be dispatched until this pre-authorisation check has been completed.
For information on when your payment will be debited from your account please see the "When will I be charged?"
section in our Orders & Shipping FAQs.
==========
Once we have verified your payment details and the Partner Boutique has accepted and approved your order for delivery, we will email you to inform you of this.
In the unlikely event that we or the Partner Boutiques encounter a problem when processing your order, we will email you explaining the problem and possibly requesting further information to try and resolve the problem.
We reserve the right not to submit your order to the Partner Boutiques, and the Partner Boutiques reserve the right not to accept your order if, for example, the product ordered is out of stock, has been withdrawn or is otherwise not available, or if we are unable to obtain authorisation for your payment or if you do not meet the eligibility criteria (e.g. you are under 18).

==========
Delivery
The estimated delivery date of the products will be stated in your order confirmation.
We will try to ensure that your order is delivered by this date but there may be circumstances where delivery is delayed because of events beyond our reasonable control (please see section 15 below in relation to this).
If this happens, we will try and arrange for your products to be delivered as soon as possible, but we will not be liable to you for any losses caused as a result of such delay.
Delivery times may vary depending on the availability of the products and your delivery address.
Delivery times are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed.
==========
The products will be delivered to you directly by the Partner Boutiques so your order may be delivered in multiple deliveries.
If no one is available at your address to take delivery, our delivery partner will leave you a note and you will need to contact them to rearrange delivery.
Please also read the information on our Orders & Shipping page as this contains important information about your order and its delivery.

==========
International Delivery
Details of the countries we deliver to can be found on our Orders & Shipping page.
There are restrictions on some products for certain international destinations, so please review the information on that page carefully before ordering products.
If you order products for delivery to an international destination, your order may be subject to import duties and taxes which are applied when the delivery reaches that destination.
Please see section 7(b) (above) for more information on these duties and taxes.
In certain countries we may use an importer of record to facilitate customs clearance and delivery to customers.
==========
You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined.
We will not be liable or responsible if you break any such laws.
10.
==========
Returns Policy
Please take the time to read the Returns Policy on our Returns and Refunds page.
Depending on where you live, if you are a consumer you have a legal right to cancel your order under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 ("DSRs").
This means that, during a certain period, if you change your mind or for any other reason you decide you do not want to keep the products, you can notify us of your decision to cancel and receive a refund from the relevant Partner Boutiques.

Ethical sourcing policy
As a reputable and trusted business committed to offering its customers high quality products, we recognise our obligation to ensure that all Partner Boutiques and other suppliers are operating ethically.
We expect all Partner Boutiques and other suppliers to consistently provide an environment which protects their employees' health and safety and basic human rights.
All Partner Boutiques and other suppliers are expected to comply with their national employment laws and regulations with particular regard to: minimum age of employment, freely chosen employment, health and safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, no discrimination, no harsh or inhumane treatment, working hours, rates of pay and terms of employment.
==========
We will never knowingly allow a Partner Boutique to offer its products on the Website if such products are sourced from countries which are in breach of these principles.
We also look to the Partner Boutiques and other suppliers to instil these principles when dealing with their own supplier base.
Because of the sometimes complex nature of the Partner Boutiques and other suppliers' supply chain, it is not always possible to monitor and control the conditions of each individual involved in the production of the products.
However, as we continue to grow, we recognise the importance of being proactive and doing everything within our power to support the rights of those involved in the manufacture of the products.
