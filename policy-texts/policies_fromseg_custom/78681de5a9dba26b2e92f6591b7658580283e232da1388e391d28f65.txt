This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how information is collected and used pursuant to offering our products and services (the "Branch Metrics Services" or the “Service”).
==========

==========
We also require Clients to setup a user ID and unique password for account security purposes.
Clients also have the option of uploading a profile photo and adding other team members to their account.
==========
This account information enables us to setup an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts.
We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with access to special promotions.
==========
We offer a mechanism to opt-out from marketing related emails described below.
The Website: What we collect from Users that visit the Website
While it is not necessary to provide PII to simply visit our Website, some Users may provide PII to Branch Metrics by sending us an email or filling out an online form on the Website.
==========
We generally use this information to answer their question and may store that information for our record keeping purposes.
We also collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) via the Website from Users, including Clients.
Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system.

The Branch Metrics Services: Overview
Branch Metrics offers a self-serve tool that enables our Clients to create customizable and sharable “deep links” that provide Clients with additional insights into how Users download and utilize our Clients’ mobile Apps.
A deep link is a hyperlink that enables the Service to track User activity beyond shares and through installs.
Users encounter the Branch Service’s deep links in multiple ways, including: dynamically inside a mobile App, via SMS or email when Clients send links directly to their customers and prospects or when Users send other Users links directly, and via social networking platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn when Clients (or other Users) share our link socially.
Our Service enables Clients to recognize browsers and mobile devices over time in order to ascertain whether a device that clicked one of our deep links is likely to be the same device that installed a particular mobile App.
Our Service’s ability to recognize devices over time enables our Clients to help customize User App experiences, conduct analytics and better understand the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.
Information Collected via Branch Metrics deep links
When a User clicks onto a deep link created via our Service by a Client, certain information is collected about that User’s mobile device.
Most of this information is considered Non-PII, including: the mobile platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier, iOS Identifier for Advertising, iOS Identifier for Vendors, Android Advertiser ID, IP address, the device model, manufacturer and device O/S, session start/stop time, mobile network code, network status (WiFi, etc.).
==========
We may also use persistent cookies to help us collect or store this information.
Our cookies can be deleted or rejected through the browser settings of the User’s device.
==========
Branch Metrics utilizes any combination of this data to help us identify a User's device(s) pursuant to providing the Service.
Clients may also pass custom data points to Branch pursuant to providing the Services such as the ad campaign name or information used to customize your experience with an App post install.
==========
The type of custom information shared via our Service is ultimately determined by our Clients.
We strongly encourage Clients not to share sensitive information such as credit card or password information via our Service.
==========
Information Collected post App Install
When a User installs and opens a mobile App that contains the Branch SDK, the Service collects the same information from the device described above (e.g., IP address, O/S and O/S version, Etc.) and ascertains whether it is likely that the same device that previously clicked on a deep link is the same device that installed and downloaded that particular App.
If our technology has a reasonable level of confidence that it is the same device, the Service merges the information collected prior to the App being installed with the information collected post App install.
This enables our Clients to better understand which deep links are effective, enables them to better understand their advertising and marketing programs and enables them to customize their User’s experience with their Apps.
==========
Data Integrity, Purpose Limitation
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
==========
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Our Clients generally use the information collected via the Service to better understand their App marketing programs, to better understand how Users discover their Apps, and to customize their Users’ app experiences.
For example, a retailer might want to direct some of their Users to the section of the App that offers shoes, while directing other Users to the section of the App that offers shirts.
Some App developers might even want to place shoes into an App’s shopping cart for Users that indicated a strong interest in buying a particular pair of shoes prior to downloading that App.
==========
We require that our Clients utilize our Service responsibly and in accordance with our Terms and Conditions of Service.
Branch Metrics is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients.
==========
Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policies.
Users should review the privacy policy of any company prior to sharing their information.

Introduction
Branch drives a security program that includes the following focus areas: product security, infrastructure controls (physical and logical), policies, employee awareness, intrusion detection, and assessment activities.
Confidentiality
Access to customer data is tightly controlled and given only via official authorization.
==========
All access is logged and audited on a regular basis to ensure appropriate security privileges.
Additional safeguards have also been implemented to adequately monitor and manage Branch user behavior.
==========
Personnel Practices
Branch conducts background checks on all employees before employment, and employees receive security training during onboarding as well as on an ongoing basis.
All employees are required to go through our comprehensive information security training policy covering the security, availability, and confidentiality of the Branch services.
In addition, we periodically conduct internal phishing audits and require all compromised employees to go through additional security training.
==========
Compliance
Branch utilizes a payments platform provider which is PCI DSS compliant, as well as SAS 70, EU Privacy Shield compliant.
The environment that hosts the Branch services maintains multiple certifications for its data centers, including ISO 27001 compliance, PCI Certification, and SOC reports.
Please see our privacy policy for information about our EU Privacy Shield compliance.
==========
Network Security
Branch defines its network boundaries using a combination of load balancers, security groups, firewalls, and VPNs.
We use these to control which services we expose to the Internet and to segment our production network from the rest of our computing infrastructure.
==========
We limit who has access to our production infrastructure based on business need and strongly authenticate that access.
In addition to sophisticated system monitoring and logging, we have implemented two-factor authentication for all server access across our production environment.
Firewalls are configured according to industry best practices and unnecessary ports are blocked by configuration with AWS Security Groups.
==========
Customer Segregation
The Branch service is multi-tenant and partner data may live on the same server as another partner’s data; however, Branch utilizes logical separation to segment that data from other partner data.
Branch treats all data related to your company as private data and will never grant other partners access.
==========
Account Security
Branch never stores your password in plaintext.
When we need to securely store your account password to authenticate you, we use bcrypt with a unique salt for each credential.
We select the number of hashing iterations in a way that strikes a balance between user experience and password cracking complexity.
Media Disposal and Destruction
We never repurpose storage media for use outside our production environment if it has ever been used to store user data.
==========
Report a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Branch, please let us know right away.
We will investigate all reports and do our best to quickly fix valid issues.
Please send an email to security@branch.io and our security team will respond as soon as possible.
