To keep you informed of our privacy policies, we have provided this document disclosing Designtechnica's intent, purpose and use of possibly private information, and detailing the methods of gathering of such information.
Visitors to Designtechnica are not subject to involuntary information disclosure of any kind, other than those intrinsic to the operation of the site and the World Wide Web in general.
Certain operations and features on Designtechnica may require the use of cookies and/or the propagation of session information.
These cookies and sessions facilitate the visitor's experience at Designtechnica, but do not represent any other security or privacy concern outside of isolated, per visit session identification and/or recurring sessions for the purpose of storing and maintaining user submitted site preferences.
==========
Designtechnica does not collect private information from its users without their knowledge.
Generally, users who come to Designtechnica are not required to disclose personal or private information.
However, some special services such as forums and member content may require registration in order to allow full access to features.
==========
Further, Designtechnica encourages users to provide cursory private and/or personal information to build the community aspect of the site, and to obtain basic group demographics data for statistical analysis.
Designtechnica does NOT sell, lease or rent to third parties, any private information linkable to a particular user and gathered through the registration process, without express consent from its users as indicated through information forms that users voluntarily fill out.
From time to time, Designtechnica may offer incentives to users in the form 
  of contests, prizes, and giveaways, and request that users fill out surveys 
  or questionnaires to qualify for participation in these special promotions.
==========
Unless explicitly indicated, information from these surveys, and questionnaires 
  are used in group demographics studies and for better audience targeting - surveys 
  and questionnaires related to contests may be subject to third party 
  marketing companies.
If you do not want your information subject to third party 
  companies, do not fill out the contest surveys.
==========
Designtechnica will take reasonable precautionary measures to protect and 
        safeguard all information gathered from its users for membership purposes.
Designtechnica does not, however, take any responsibility for any breach 
        of security, accidental disclosure, theft, or tampering of its users' 
        information.

Privacy for Children - As per COPA
Although Designtechnica generally targets to an adult audience, we welcome the visitation and participation of young users, with their parents' consent.
It is strongly recommended that users under the age of 13 refrain from disclosing any personal and/or private information either through the user registration system, or through participation in questionnaires and surveys, and instead opt to remain anonymous in their participation of site activities.
Please note that as of April 21st, 2000, the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 prohibits Designtechnica from the collection of private information from users under the age of 13 without parental consent.
Users under the age of 13 must provide a signed letter from their parents to indicate that they are aware of their child's activities on Designtechnica and consent to these activities.
This letter must be mailed or faxed to Designtechnica Corporation, using the contact information below, before they can participate in activities requesting the disclosure of private information.
Parents of our younger users may at any time, revoke their consent, and may request to review and edit the private information disclosed by sending a written request to Designtechnica Corporation, via fax or mail.
Though Designtechnica will take reasonable measures to ensure that users under the age of 13 do not disclose their private information without first obtaining parental consent, the site cannot guarantee the protection of young users who choose not to disclose their age and who do not follow the requirements set forth by COPA.
