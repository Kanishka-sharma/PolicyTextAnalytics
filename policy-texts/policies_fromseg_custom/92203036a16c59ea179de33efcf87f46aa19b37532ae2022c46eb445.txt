Cookies
 
This online offer uses cookies and similar technologies (hereinafter collectively referred to as "cookies").
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent when a website is visited and stored in the user's browser.
If the corresponding website is called up again, the user's browser sends the contents of the cookies back and thus enables the user to be recognized.
Certain cookies are automatically deleted at the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are stored in the user's browser for a specified time or permanently and then delete themselves automatically (so-called temporary or permanent cookies).
In principle, no data that makes you identifiable as a person (e.g. no names, e-mail addresses or IP addresses) is stored in cookies.
Instead, cookies typically contain a code (so-called identifier) as well as information on the storage period and, if applicable, certain technical features (e.g. security functions).
==========
However, cookies can be used to create user profiles.
How can you adjust your cookie settings or delete cookies?
Except for essential cookies (essential cookies), we only use cookies with your consent.
You can grant this consent via our Consent Management Platform ("CMP") and subsequently revoke it at any time with effect for the future by configuring your privacy settings.
You can reach these settings here:
Privacy Settings
Furthermore, you can delete already stored cookies in your browser at any time.
==========
Please note, however, that this online offer may not function or the only function to a limited extent without cookies.
What cookies do we use?
Essential cookies
These cookies and other information are necessary for the function of our service.
They guarantee that our service is secure and functions as you want it to.

Functional cookies
We want to make our service as good as possible for you.
==========

To do this, we would like to analyse the use of the service and evaluate it in statistical form.
10.
==========
Web Analysis
 
We require statistical information on the use of our online service to make it more user-friendly, to measure reach and to conduct market research.
For this purpose, we use analysis tools.
The usage profiles created by the tools using functional cookies and by evaluating the log files are not combined with personal data.
The tools either do not use IP addresses of users at all or shorten them immediately after collection.
As a rule, the providers of the tools process data only as processors in accordance with our instructions and not for their own purposes.
==========
You can prevent the creation of user profiles for analysis purposes by not giving your consent to the use of functional cookies in our Consent Management Platform ("CMP") or by revoking them.
You will also find further information on the providers of the tools used in the CMP.
