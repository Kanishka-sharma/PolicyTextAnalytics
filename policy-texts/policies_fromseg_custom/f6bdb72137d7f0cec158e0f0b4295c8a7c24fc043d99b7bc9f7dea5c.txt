Mass General Privacy and Security policy
This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect, how it is used and what your choices are.
By using the Massachusetts General Hospital (“Mass General Hospital” or “Mass General”) website, you agree to acceptance of this our Website Privacy Policy.
Please read the following carefully before using the site.
==========
Information Collection and Use
Information We Collect
When you view Mass General’s website, you do so anonymously.
We do not collect any personal information that identifies you unless you specifically provide us with contact information voluntarily.
Personal information includes information that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, social security number, e-mail address or telephone number.
==========
The only personal information that Mass General obtains through its website is supplied voluntarily by website visitors.
By submitting personal information, you grant Mass General the right to transmit, monitor, retrieve, store and use your information in connection with the operation of the website.
Personal information is always stored in a secure database.
==========
You might be asked to provide personal information, such as demographic information, if you choose to complete any of the online forms used for event registration, special events and promotions, appointment requests, login to personal information and to provide feedback.
The information required to complete the transaction is noted on each specific form.
Additional questions might be included to help us improve the services we offer.
How We Use This Information
Mass General uses the information you provide to fulfill online requests, process credit card information and respond to customer service inquiries or in other ways as required by law.
Requested information on voluntary forms is used to provide the services that you request, such as event registration, special events and promotions, appointment requests, login to personal information and to provide feedback.
Only authorized staff at Mass General have access to your information, including those who need the information provided to perform a specific task.
==========
All Mass General hospital employees are required to attend training on patient privacy and confidentiality.
Data Security
Mass General makes every effort to ensure that your personal information remains as secure as possible.
Accordingly, we prevent unauthorized access by a secure firewall and use of security technologies to protect the integrity and privacy of any personal information you provide.
As an additional security measure, your personal information is also encrypted during transmission by Secure Socket Layer 128-bit encryption software.
==========
(Encryption is a common method used to transmit sensitive data across the Internet.
Encryption temporarily makes the text unreadable during the time it is being transmitted over the Internet.)
This is an industry standard.
Although we endeavor to protect your personal information, Mass General cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through online applications, and you do so at your own risk.
==========
Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication could be discarded or archived.
If you wish, you can contact us instead by telephone at the numbers provided throughout our site.
Online Forms
Forms provided on Mass General’s website are meant for feedback or general purposes only, and they do not request confidential health information.
Although every attempt is made to provide security measures in the transmission of information, patients should not use online forms to submit confidential health care or other information.
Mass General is not responsible if unauthorized parties gain access to the confidential information shared in the online forms.
To protect your privacy, please do not use online forms to communicate information that you consider confidential.
