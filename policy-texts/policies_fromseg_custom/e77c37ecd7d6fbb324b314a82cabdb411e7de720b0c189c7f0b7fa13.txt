The New York Times Electronic Media Company (NYTEMC) has adopted a set of information management guidelines which serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships.
==========
These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established.
Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change.
Any such changes will be posted on this page.

NYTEMC requires that consumers supply personal information, including e-mail address, during a "registration" process prior to using the site.
(Some of the personal information we request is voluntary; the word "optional" appears next to these questions.)
On occasion, NYTEMC also collects additional personal information from subscribers in optional contest and survey forms.
Demographic information provided by a subscriber may be combined with site usage reports to profile, in aggregate form, users and their preferences in site content and advertising.
Following registration NYTEMC employs "cookies" to recognize a subscriber and his or her access privileges on The New York Times on the Web, as well as to track site usage.

What does The New York Times Electronic Media Company do with the information it gathers/tracks?
NYTEMC may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners.
In performance of these statistical analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.
Personal information on individual subscribers will not be provided to any third party.
Using the e-mail addresses provided at registration, NYTEMC periodically sends promotional e-mail to its subscribers about services offered by NYTEMC and its advertisers.
A consumer can indicate on the subscriber registration form that he or she does not wish to receive e-mail information from NYTEMC or its advertisers.
NYTEMC may contact a subscriber regarding account status or changes to the subscriber agreement.
3.
With whom does The New York Times Electronic Media Company share the information it gathers/tracks?
==========
NYTEMC shares the information it tracks, in aggregate form, with advertisers and other partners.
We do not release personal information about any individual subscriber to third parties.
NYTEMC will provide a subscriber a summary of his or her personal information provided at registration upon request.
This information will only be sent to the e-mail address on file for the subscriber name associated with it.
Upon request, NYTEMC will remove any subscriber (and his or her personal information) from our database, or allow any subscriber to "opt out" of further contact (while still allowing access to the site) or change/correct personal information that the subscriber states is erroneous.
To obtain an information summary or request a change of information, send e-mail to Customer Service.
NYTEMC is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link.
