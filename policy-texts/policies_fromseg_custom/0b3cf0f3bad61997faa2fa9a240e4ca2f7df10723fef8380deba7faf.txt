The Monkey takes user privacy pretty dang seriously.
Our goal is to make PicMonkey a great experience.
However, as much as we love you, we are not interested in knowing everything about you.
==========
Here's the scoop in layman's terms: the collection, use, and preservation of personal information by PicMonkey only happens when it serves to make PicMonkey better, faster, or more convenient for you.
The disclosure of personally identifiable information will never occur without your explicit consent.
So, does PicMonkey use cookies?
Yes, PicMonkey does set cookies to make your experience better.
No, you can't eat these cookies!
Cookies are pieces of information that web sites transfer to computers browsing that web site.
Theyâ€™re used for record-keeping purposes, and to make web surfing easier by doing things like saving your password or information about how you prefer to use the web site.
They also make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.
It's pretty much an industry standard.
You can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from any web site you visit.
If you do this, it's possible that some areas of PicMonkey might not work as well.
Information we collect and how we use that information
We collect standard web server traffic pattern information; stuff like who's coming to our site, how they use it, and how long folks stay on the site.
This type of information is shared externally, if at all, only as an aggregated pile of data, which means no part of it can be traced back to you, specifically.
==========
Our registration form asks for contact information that includes your name, email address, address, and similar information.
We use this information to contact you if there's a question about your account or to tell you about any significant changes in PicMonkey's operations or business plans.
If you don't want to receive these communications, shoot us an email at info@picmonkey.com and we'll gladly oblige.
==========
We don't collect or store sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers.
Will any of my personally identifiable information be shared with third parties?
No.
==========
If it were up to us, spammers would be put in a monkey barrel!
If PicMonkey is ever acquired, we will provide notice before any personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
It's not our goal to be acquired, but we feel that it's prudent to be clear about what you can expect if it happens.
Your ongoing support of PicMonkey will ensure that we will never have to sell to another company.
Are the images I upload to PicMonkey public?
==========
Nope.
Negative.
No siree bob.
==========
Can anyone use my image?
No; you own your images!
The copyright for the image remains with you even after you use PicMonkey.
We will not use your image without your consent.
If we ever get a notion about featuring one of your publicly shared images on our blog or PicMonkey's main site, we will contact you and ask for your permission before doing any such thing.
==========
Will this privacy policy change?
As PicMonkey evolves, this privacy policy is likely to evolve with it.
We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent.
We will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
We also adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (ProTip: this has nothing to do with boats).

If you've got any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.
