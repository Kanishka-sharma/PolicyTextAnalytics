Information Collected
        

            Here are a few ways we collect your information and the types of information we

We may also obtain information from other sources.
We may take that information
            and combine it with information we collect about you.

Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users' needs so that we can better
            consider new features or otherwise tailor our products and services.
This Policy
            does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate data.
