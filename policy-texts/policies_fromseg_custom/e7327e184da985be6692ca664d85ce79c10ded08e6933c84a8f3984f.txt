==========
What is Citrix Online's GoToMeeting® product and why is my information needed?
GoToMeeting is an online managed service that allows users to collaborate on documents, deliver presentations, perform product demonstrations and securely share confidential information from anywhere, anytime.
Because GoToMeeting is Web based, it requires the use of first and last names, billing contact information, a password and a valid email address as a login.
Therefore, at a minimum, we require such necessary information during the registration process.
The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this site.

What information does Citrix Online gather/track and how is it used?
PERSONAL INFORMATION: Because of the nature of our product, we must collect personal information from users during the registration process, including (at minimum) first and last names, an email address to be used as a login, billing contact information, credit card number and a password.
When a user registers online for a free trial of the service, Citrix Online will take steps to validate the credit card and billing information supplied to us to ensure it is accurate.
We also use this information to determine your eligibility for our one-time free trial offer.
The credit card information supplied will then be used to establish your subscription with us should you decide to continue the service after the free trial has ended.
Your email address may be used to send you periodic newsletters from Citrix Online and GoToMeeting.
We may also send you offers on behalf of third-party advertisers.
==========
Users can opt out of promotional emails at anytime, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to you.
We use the information collected to deliver services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and services and generally maintain your accounts with us.
We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown reasons.
==========
GoToMeeting in-session information is end-to-end encrypted and only accessible by the authorized meeting organizer and participants.
"In-session information" includes all screen sharing data, keyboard/mouse control data and text chat information.
This information is never exposed in unencrypted form while temporarily resident within Citrix Online communication infrastructure servers or during transmission across public or private networks.
Information about scheduled meetings and prior meetings such as subject, organizer name, and meeting time is stored on our website and is available to the meeting organizer and authenticated users that have received an invitation from the organizer via email, instant messenger, phone, or other communication method.
==========
Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction.
To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records.
BUSINESS INFORMATION: Information that is provided by meeting organizers or administrators such as meeting schedules, attendee lists (participant name, email address and any other business contact information requested by the meeting organizer) and meeting subject name is considered confidential to the purchaser or co-sponsor of the meeting event.
When an attendee registers with one of our customers for an online meeting, that information is provided to the Organizer of the session.
Citrix Online may store that information to fulfill our obligation to our customers, but we will not use the information to send marketing communications for Citrix Online services or Third Party offers to attendees.
You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit while in-session and utilizing the chat feature can be read, collected or used by the meeting organizer and other meeting participants.
==========
We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service.
We will only use the Business Information provided for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of your GoToMeeting experience.
PARTNERS: In some cases we provide services or sell product lines jointly with other businesses.
==========
For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to those transactions with that third party.
On the co-branded registration pages we will state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use so that you will know at the time you create your account exactly how your information will be used.
If you are registered with Citrix Online through a partnership and you request to opt out of receiving promotional updates, in order to comply with the provisions in the Can Spam Act, we will also provide your email address to that partner so that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Citrix Online.
==========
SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session.
The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible at GoToMeeting.
SECURITY INFORMATION: Citrix Online also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes.
This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies, and other uniquely identifying information of machines that have the GoToMeeting software downloaded and installed.
This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services.
All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers.
==========
SURVEYS: In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development.
We use such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services offered to each individual user.
Such information will not be passed to third parties without your prior consent unless where required by applicable law.

However, we do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about individual users.

An ad ID and a partner ID are stored in the cookie, but no personally identifiable information specific to the actual visitor is stored.
Citrix Online does not see the cookie; we only include the Web beacon on our page, which results in a request to the partner's servers from the customer browser.
We have no control over their use of the cookie after it is placed on our site.
Citrix Online also uses the Omniture SiteCatalyst HBX by Omniture (http://www.omniture.com/en/company/acquisitions/visualsciences/privacy/policy) to provide information on visitor traffic patterns and to assist us in maintaining a more effective Web site.
The Web beacons used in connection with the SiteCatalyst HBX services do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our Web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous information about Web site usage.
==========
The anonymous profiles contain information about browser versions, operating systems, screen resolutions and what content, products and services you look at when visiting our site.
The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.
