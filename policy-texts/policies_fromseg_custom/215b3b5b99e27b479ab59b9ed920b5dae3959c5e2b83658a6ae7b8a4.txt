Categories and Sources of Personal Data and Purposes and Lawful Basis for Processing
MiQ is a technology company operating in the digital advertising ecosystem.
We use data analytics to help our clients (advertisers, media agencies, brands) to advertise their ads on various websites that allow third party advertising, so called ‘publishers’.
We develop insights into the browsing behaviour of website users for our clients or for publishers in order to develop targeted digital advertising campaigns for our clients that create a better user experience.
==========
We participate in various industry schemes that are designed to ensure that any user-level personal data we process for these purposes is collected and processed on the basis of the user’s consent.
We also collect and process personal data about visitors to our own website (//localhost/), as well as business contact data relating to the account representatives of our customers and vendors, and visitors to our physical premises.
We may source, use and otherwise process personal data in different ways in regard to each of these data subject categories, as explained in the following sections.
Section 3.1           Visitors to publishers’ websites
Section 3.2           Visitors to this MiQ website
Section 3.3           Representatives of our existing and prospective customers and vendors and marketing contacts
Section 3.4           Visitors to our premises

A – Sources of personal data
B – Personal data that we collect and process
C – Why do we collect your personal data and what are our lawful bases for it?
==========
D – How long do we keep your personal data?
MiQ analyses web browsing usage in order to provide our clients (advertisers and media agencies) with the ability to improve returns on their digital advertising spend by enabling them to serve ads that are relevant to website visitors.We use cookies and similar applications to develop marketing insights about user preferences, sometime in combination with other data sets, in order to better match ad content with user interests.
A – Sources of personal data
The websites that users visit may allow third parties, such as MiQ, to set cookies or similar applications on user devices or browsers when they visit the websites.
We collect and analyse the data obtained via these applications.
==========
We may combine this data with aggregate data obtained from social media companies and market research firms, and user-level data from other advertising technology companies that support our services in various ways, such as fraud prevention through the detection of “bots.”
B – Personal data that we collect and process
MiQ collects various categories of personal data at the user level, including the following:
IP address, which helps us to understand the broad location of a user
Device ID (when users access websites on mobile devices), such as IDFA, AAID, SHA1
User ID stored in a cookie placed on a user’s browser
Latitude-longitude location data
Timestamp on accessing the website and the website URL
Enrichment data collected about you from third parties, such as Nielsen & Eyeota.
Tweets & Twitter handles, made publicly available via the Twitter platform
User interactions with the ad placed, i.e. we will know if a user clicks on it or the user’s browser & operating system type.
==========
Sometimes advertisers may provide us with information on what users have previously purchases from them and when, in order to make our predictions more accurate.
Cookie technology is placed on devices to assist with the ad delivery process.
This includes:
(1)  A user ID cookie to support ad personalisation, which lasts for 90 days
(2)  An opt-out cookie to store your opt-out and consent preferences, which lasts for 90 days
(3)  A session cookie to see if a browser supports cookies, which lasts for 1 browsing session
(4)  A cookie which limits the number of ads which a given user sees, which lasts for 90 days
(5)  A cookie which denotes whether a user ID is synced with other partners in the ad-serving chain
(6)  A cookie which supports billing and reporting.
==========
Although we do not collect information that directly identifies individual users by name or physical address, we collect your IP address and other information about you which may make this information personal data.
For example, based on a user’s historic browsing behaviour, we may map an IP address to a city or a geographical region and other information such as weather in that region, in order to predict users’ future buying decisions.
However, we never make decisions or predictions based on the characteristics of one individual.
Instead we usually only target population segments or groups of individuals.
These segments involve aggregated user data of no less than 1,500 users, but more typically hundreds of thousands of users who may share common characteristics, such as demographics and specific interests, such as preferences for particular types of cars.
==========
C – Why do we collect your personal data and what are our lawful bases for it?
We collect user-level personal data so that users can see ads displayed on the websites they visit which we think are most relevant to them based on their browsing behaviour and interests.
This enhances the user experience while at the same time making our clients’ advertising campaigns more efficient and effective.
We use data analytics to predict user interests based on machine-learning techniques involving the use of algorithms.
Our data scientists regularly review the algorithms that we use in order to ensure they are properly adjusted and error-free.
==========
MiQ has approved an “Pixel Implementation” policy which provides, among other things, that we will not target children or vulnerable adults or collect any special categories of personal data about users.
MiQ’s “Creative Guidelines” prohibit any discriminatory messages and place restrictions on advertising related to gambling, health & politics.
Consent
MiQ has joined a number of industry schemes including the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (http://advertisingconsent.eu/) and Your Online Ad Choices (http://www.youronlinechoices.com) that have been developed to ensure that users are in a position to decide whether and how they want their web browser data used for digital advertising purposes.
MiQ’s Vendor Identification number within the transparency and consent framework is 101.
==========
As a result, MiQ will not process personal data unless it can be evidenced that their publisher & advertiser partners have first obtained the users’ permission to do so.
This is usually done by means of a pop-up window that enables users to manage their preferences in regard to cookie application and related data processing.
When a user visits a website with which MiQ is associated, they will see a message asking them if they agree to allow the website publisher’s and third-party cookies to be set on their device and collect information from it when they first visit it.
If the user agrees to the application of cookies, they will then be asked whether they consent to the processing of the information collected for each of the following purposes:
a) Ad personalisation
The personal data We collect is used to personalise ads that you see over time on other sites.
We will use the personal data We collect to infer your interests and place ads that we believe may of interest to you.
b) Ad selection, reporting and delivery
We collect information about what ads were shown, how often and when and where they were shown, whether the user clicked on them and made a purchase.
This information is used to measure the effectiveness of the ads presented.
c) Content delivery, selection and reporting
We collect and analyse information about the user’s interests and what content was shown, how often, when and where, and whether the user clicked on what was shown.
This is done to adjust the content displayed to the user to be most relevant.
d) Measurement
We collect information on web visitors’ use of content in combination with previously collected information.
==========
We use this data to understand and report on their use of content to our advertising clients or for MiQ’s internal quality assurance purposes.
In the process of using data for the above purposes, MiQ also employs the following technical features: i) matching data to offline sources, ii) linking devices and iii) precise geographic location data.
When a user agrees to the placement of cookies by Us and one or more of the identified processing activities, we will receive a message from the website where the visitor’s selection has been made, notifying Us that We have permission to set a cookie, collect information on the user’s device and use it for the agreed purposes.
A user may withdraw consent at any time on the websites visited or by changing their preferences on
www.youronlinechoices.eu.
They can do this by finding the reference to MiQ and withdrawing their consent.
==========
MiQ’s legitimate interest in preventing fraudulent website traffic
We also process personal data in order to detect the use of internet “bots” or similar functionality intended to distort the popularity of websites and digital ads by simulating human browsing activity.
If a user agrees to the placement of a cookie and accepts the processing of their personal data for one or more of the purposes described above, our ability to detect this type of fraudulent behaviour is important to ensure that the data we rely on to cater to user preferences is not distorted by false inputs.
We therefore use a third-party vendor to assess whether the IP addresses that we are processing are associated with fraudulent activity.
==========
MiQ’s legitimate interest in analysing social trends
We also process personal data in order to analyse trends in social media activity.
This involves analysing common keywords that appear in public posts made available on the Twitter platform and producing aggregated insights from these to inform our advertisers about current social trends.
We may use Twitter handles to identify trends relating to companies and popular personalities.
==========
Should a user wish to object to our processing of their personal data for these purposes, they may do so by contacting our DPO as indicated in Section 2 above.
D – How long do we keep your personal data?
MiQ minimises the personal data it collects about users and retains the data for only limited periods.
Raw data that MiQ collects about user online activities is kept for no longer than 180 days from the date collected and is stored in a secure environment.
The user-level data is either anonymised or aggregated after 180 days, which means the information is expressed only in a summary form about user behaviour representing large groups of individuals.
Anonymous data may be kept at MiQ for 2 years and aggregated information relating to financial performance stored for up to 7 years for accounting and audit purposes.
During the initial 180-day period, the information about user online behaviour is used to better target the ad campaigns and adjust the audience to ensure the ad is displayed to user groups that may be most interested in the product or service advertised.
The data collected as part of the ad campaign may be used to develop insight reports for MiQ clients concerning advertising trends and campaign results.
==========
These reports are based on data that is provided in an aggregated form and does not allow for the identification of individuals.

Information we collect
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
As part of our on-going efforts to deliver the most applicably targeted advertisements to our clients, MiQ Digital may collect and use log files, web beacons, cookies, device information, location information, and information available through other technologies, each as further defined below, to collect data from browsers and devices, advertiser sites, third party sites (“Sites”), and mobile applications.
The Information collected is used to inform our propensity models, which are then used primarily for ad targeting purposes, and as otherwise noted below in the section titled “How We Use Your Information.”
Such information enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of MiQ Digital’s services.
==========
“Cookies” are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device, which may include, for example, your computer, tablet, smartphone or other PDA.
We may use Cookies for purposes that include estimating the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display.
Cookies allow advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach.
==========
Cookies are also used to improve the user experience online.
They may be used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement, and to provide users with more relevant advertising.
There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) “Session Cookies” are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) “Persistent Cookies” can remain on your browser for up to 2 years from your last visit to the Sites (but more commonly 90 days) and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.
A useful resource on understanding Cookies may be found at http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
==========
“Device Information” is information we automatically collect and store related to the device used when you visit Sites and mobile applications, including the type of device you are using (e.g., an iPhone), certain device identifiers that are unique to the device you are using, and your internet service provider.
“Location Information” is information acquired from your device’s global position system (GPS) signal, WiFi networks proximately accessible to your device, nearby cell towers, and other available location data.
When you use location enabled services on a Site or mobile application with location-enabled services, this type of information may be made available to us.
==========
“Other Technologies Information” relates to information that is now or may in the future become available through new technologies and the non-PII related information you share or otherwise make available.
How we use your information
Information Used and Shared by MiQ Digital
MiQ Digital will only use the Information we collect about you for the limited purposes provided for in this Privacy Policy.
This includes using and sharing Information (1) to deliver or assist our clients in delivering targeted ads to potential customers or other individuals; (2) to enable third party service providers to assist or facilitate in the services we provide to our clients; (3) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (4) to enforce our terms of use or to protect our rights ; (5) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service; (6) with other MiQ Digital entities, affiliates, and third party marketing partners (including advertisers and publishers) for marketing purposes; (7) with vendors, administrative service providers, technology providers, and carefully selected partners for data validation, enhancement, information verification and suppression services; and/or (8) for any other purpose for which you provide consent.
We also may share Information with advertisers, publishers and other third parties for marketing purposes, but such Information does not include PII.
When targeting advertising campaigns on behalf of our clients, we may or may not choose to target users based on their Non-PII.
This includes, but is not limited to, IP host address, the date and time of activity online, the pages viewed, browser type, referring URL, Internet Service Provider and operating system.
We do not collect PII such as name, address, phone number, email address, credit card information, financial account information, or anything else that can personally identify individuals on behalf of our clients.
==========
Our use of Non-PII when targeting advertising campaigns is to ensure that MiQ delivers the most appropriate and tailored ads to audiences online.
Advertising campaigns delivered on behalf of our clients may include “interest-based” ads, which utilize Non-PII we have collected or received about your activities and interests across your linked devices or in connection with a single online action, such as visiting a particular website.
This type of interest-based advertising is sometime referred to as “retargeting.”
In connection with this type of interest-based advertising, we may use propensity models to predict users that may be interested in certain categories or “segments.”
==========
For instance, if you have recently visited a real estate website and a mortgage website, you may be placed in a “prospective homebuyer” segment, which may result in advertisers interested in this segment, such as a real estate broker, to show you, along with others in that segment, ads related to their offerings.
In some cases, we may use Non-PII, non-sensitive, health-related topics, such as data related to visiting websites about acne or dry eyes, to create segments which our advertisers may use to retarget the users in that segment.
We create propensity models and use said models for targeting or retargeting.
These segments are created using algorithms to identify the set of consumer (non-health) variables most highly correlated with the profile of individuals with the specific health condition.
No health data is ever used in the application of the models, making the approach HIPAA-compliant and privacy-safe.
Clic here for a full list of the standard interest segments for interest-based advertising that are based on health-related information or interests used by MiQ Digital in performing its services.
==========
Information Collected by Third Party Sites
Please be aware that the websites and mobile applications of our advertiser clients, as well as the websites and mobile applications on which we place advertisements either on our own behalf or on behalf of our clients, or any third party websites or mobile applications linked to one of our Sites or with which have agreed to place a cookie on their site on our behalf or on behalf of our advertiser, may collect Non-PII information from you.
Such information may include non-personally identifiable information through the use of Cookies and other technology (as described above), and with respect to third party sites and mobile applications, any personally identifiable information you may choose to give in registering and transacting with such website.
This data, excluding PII, may be combined with data collected by MiQ Digital and used for ad targeting purposes.

We may use cross-device mapping services in order to link devices that belong to the same user or household.
Users can opt-out of the collection of information for each device and browser by taking the steps mentioned above (i.e. opt-outs are not effective across multiple devices, even if said devices are linked for advertising purposes).
However, opting out of the collection of information for one device or browser will not result in you being opted-out of the collection of information for other devices or browsers.
==========
As such, you may need to opt-out of multiples devices and browsers.
Please note that use of the opt-out Cookie will affect our ability to provide you content and advertisements that will more effectively match your interests and may prevent us from controlling the frequency with which you may view any particular advertisement.
Please report any problems related to the opt-out process, or any complaints with regards to online behavioural advertising data and its use, to privacy@miqdigital.com.
