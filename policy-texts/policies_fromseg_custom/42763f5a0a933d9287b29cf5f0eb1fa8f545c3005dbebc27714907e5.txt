ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Please read this section carefully.
==========
It affects your rights.
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by contacting us at corehelp@salon.com.
==========
This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Salon.
Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.
You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.
Please read this Provision carefully.
==========
It provides that all Disputes between you and Salon shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration replaces the right to go to court.
In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).
Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).
==========
For the purpose of this Provision, the “Salon” means Salon and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.
The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Salon regarding any aspect of your relationship with Salon, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).
==========
“Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Salon’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution
For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Salon an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.
==========
You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Salon.com, LLC, 101 Spear Street, Suite 203, San Francisco, CA 94105.
That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.
==========
If Salon does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.
You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out
Notwithstanding the above, you or Salon may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).
==========
You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification Salon.com, LLC, 101 Spear Street, Suite 203, San Francisco, CA 94105.
Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Salon through arbitration.
Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Salon.
Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.
Arbitration Procedures
If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Salon may initiate arbitration proceedings.
==========
The arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules") in effect on the date of commencement of the arbitration, as modified by these TOS.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator.
The arbitration will be based entirely on the written submissions of the parties and documents submitted to the arbitrator, unless the parties agree or the arbitrator orders otherwise.
==========
Unless you and Salon both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join your claim(s) or Salon's claim(s) with any other claim, and may not preside over any representative or class proceedings.
Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.
However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.
==========
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
==========
Location of Arbitration – You or Salon may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco, California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.
In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, Salon may transfer the arbitration to San Francisco, California in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.
Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – For any arbitration in which you claim less than $10,000, Salon will reimburse you for the cost of your filing fee with JAMS and will directly pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees.
For claims between $10,000 and $75,000, you will pay any filing fee required by JAMS, and Salon will pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees.
==========
If you bring claims between $10,000 and $75,000 and the arbitrator determines that you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, Salon will pay the fee directly on your behalf.
If, however, the arbitrator determines that any claim brought by you is frivolous, then payment of JAMS' costs and fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.
Furthermore, if the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Salon for any costs or fees that it paid that otherwise would have been your responsibility under the JAMS Rules.
If you bring a claim for greater than $75,000, payment of fees and other costs to JAMS will be governed by the JAMS Rules.
==========
In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Salon as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
Class Action Waiver
Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Salon specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.
If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.
Neither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
==========
