Data Protection Policy
Due to its purposes of business and its projects and associations, The Reach Group GmbH engages extensively in the collection, processing and use of personal data.
Personal data is considered to be data relating to personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual natural person (“User”) such as his/her true name, address, age, e-mail address, telephone number or specific preferences, etc.
The collection of such data refers to the act of gathering it; the processing of personal data refers to its storage, modification, communication, locking and deletion; use is any utilization of personal data that does not constitute processing.
Personal data is protected by the EU Data Protection Directive and by the national regulations of the member states.
The Reach Group GmbH observes these regulations and thus respects the individual’s right of personality and his/her right to protection of privacy.
The Reach Group GmbH takes the protection of your personal data seriously.
We have compiled the following data protection policy in order to ensure compliance with data protection rules:
Personal Data
In mere advertising contacts with the User (e.g. serving banner impressions on a website), The Reach Group does not collect or process any personal data.
Only non-personal data — such as information on the server via which the user has logged on to the Internet, the browser which is used and whether the user clicks on the ad — is recorded anonymously.
There is no reference to a person.
==========
The Reach Group GmbH also collects and processes personal data by means of various advertising media or websites.
The scope and type of data depends on the respective information the user enters by filling out the respective input field and submitting it to The Reach Group.
Insofar as there is a contractual relationship or a relationship resembling a contractual relationship between The Reach Group GmbH and a user (through the subscription to a newsletter, for example), The Reach Group processes and uses data collected from the user as needed to fulfill its obligations to the user to the extent necessary.
If The Reach Group GmbH goes beyond the transaction and fulfillment of a contractual relationship or a relationship resembling a contractual relationship in its data collection, processing and use, then it will do so only in cases where it has the express informed consent of the user and only to the extent permitted by this consent.
Such purposes for the most part concern marketing and the collected data is used, among other things, for market research, customer acquisition, product information or services development.
The Reach Group GmbH uses cookies in order to, for example, optimize the use of the Internet by minimizing repetition of ads and increasing the share of relevant content for its users.
Cookies are not used to collect private data.
Nor is the use of cookies mandatory for The Reach Group.
