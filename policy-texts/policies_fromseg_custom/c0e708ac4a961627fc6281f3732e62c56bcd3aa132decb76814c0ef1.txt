What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server.

Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used.

Why does Zendesk use Cookies?
When you visit our Websites, we may place a number of cookies in your browser.
These are known as First Party Cookies and are required to enable to hold session information as you navigate from page to page within the website.
For example, we use cookies on our Websites to understand visitor and user preferences, improve their experience, and track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information.
We may use web beacons, tags, flash cookies, HTML5, and scripts in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
==========
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites.
Our third party partners may also use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, flash, HTML5, scripts, or other tracking technologies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests.
==========
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union you may opt into the use of cookies, by clicking here).
Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic, untargeted ads.
Interest-Based Advertising – As described in this Policy, we and third parties may wish to use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect information and infer your interests for interest-based advertising purposes.
==========
You can manage your preferences with regards to the receipt of tailored advertisements in the cookie settings described below.
Please note if these cookies are switched off, you will continue to see advertisements, but they will no longer be tailored to your interests.
5.

Essential Cookies


Essential cookies (First Party Cookies) are sometimes called “strictly necessary” as without them we cannot provide many services that you need on the Website.
For example, essential cookies help remember your preferences as you move around the Website.
2.
==========
Analytics Cookies


These cookies track information about visits to the Websites so that we can make improvements and report our performance.
For example: analyze visitor and user behavior so as to provide more relevant content or suggest certain activities.
They collect information about how visitors use the Websites, which site the user came from, the number of each user’s visits and how long a user stays on the Websites.
We might also use analytics cookies to test new ads, pages, or features to see how users react to them.

They also store your preferences when personalizing the Websites to optimize your use of Zendesk, for example, your preferred language.
These preferences are remembered, through the use of persistent cookies, and the next time you visit the Websites you will not have to set them again.
4.
==========
Targeting or Advertising Cookies


These Cookies are placed by third party advertising platforms or networks in order to deliver ads and track ad performance, enable advertising networks to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based upon your activities (this is sometimes called “behavioral” “tracking” or “targeted” advertising) on the Websites.
They may subsequently use information about your visit to target you with advertising that you may be interested in, on the Websites and other websites.
For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Websites.
