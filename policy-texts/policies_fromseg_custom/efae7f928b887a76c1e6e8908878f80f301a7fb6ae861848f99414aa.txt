DoubleClick Privacy
Statement

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to DoubleClick, our advertisers and our Web publishers.
The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users.
Below is information regarding DoubleClick's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.
User Information Collected in Ad Delivery
In the course of delivering an ad to you, DoubleClick does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address.
DoubleClick does, however, collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto or your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer).
The information collected by DoubleClick is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of DoubleClick's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it.
For additional information on the non-personally-identifiable information that is collected by DoubleClick in the process of delivering an ad to you, please click here.
In addition, in connection solely with the delivery of ads via DoubleClick technology to one particular Web publisher's Web site, DoubleClick combines the non-personally-identifiable data collected by DoubleClick from a user's computer with the log-in name and demographic data about users collected by the Web publisher and furnished to DoubleClick for the purpose of ad targeting.
==========
There are some cases when a user voluntarily provides personal information in response to an ad (a survey or purchase form, for example).
In these situations, DoubleClick (or a third party engaged by DoubleClick) collects the information on behalf of the advertiser and/or Web site.
This information is used by the advertiser and/or Web site so that you can receive the goods, services or information that you requested.
==========
Where indicated in some requests, DoubleClick may use this information in aggregate form to get a more precise profile of the type of individuals viewing ads or visiting the Web sites.
Cookies and Opt Out
DoubleClick, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience.
DoubleClick's cookies cannot be used to determine any personally-identifiable information about you and do not damage your system or files in any way.
Here's how it works.
==========
When you are first served an ad by DoubleClick, DoubleClick assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer.
Then, when you visit a Web site on which DoubleClick serves ads, DoubleClick reads this number to help target ads to you.
The cookie can help ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over again.
==========
Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site.
This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs.
While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising.
==========
If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature.
To find out more about this procedure, please click  here.
While some third parties offer programs to manually delete your cookies, DoubleClick goes one step further by offering you a "blank" or "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being stored.
If you would like more information on how to opt-out, please click here.
Disclosure
DoubleClick makes available all of our information practices at www.doubleclick.net, including in-depth descriptions of our targeting capabilities, our privacy policy, and full disclosure on the use of cookies (above).
==========
In addition, we provide all users with the option to contact us at info@doubleclick.net with any further questions or concerns.
Security
DoubleClick will maintain the confidentiality of the information that it collects during the process of delivering an ad.
DoubleClick maintains internal practices that help to protect the security and confidentiality of this information by limiting employee access to and use of this information.
Honesty
DoubleClick has voluntarily opened its practices and systems for third party auditing.
==========
We are committed to shaping privacy policies and standards with industry organizations and are active members of the Internet Advertising Bureau, Online Privacy Alliance, New York New Media Association, and the American Advertising Federation.
DoubleClick's policy on privacy is also in accordance with the Direct Marketing Association's Marketing Online Privacy Principles, which were agreed upon by the Interactive Services Association.
User Information Collected by DoubleClick's Web Sites
Typically, DoubleClick does not know the name, email address, phone number home address or other personal information about anyone who visits a Web site to which DoubleClick serves an ad.
However, for the Web sites owned or controlled by DoubleClick,  such as www.NetDeals.com and www.IAF.net, DoubleClick may ask for and collect such personal information.
DoubleClick is committed to providing meaningful notice and choice to users before any personal information is submitted to us.
Specifically, users will be informed about how DoubleClick may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to us.
Users will always be offered the choice not to provide personal information or to have it shared with others.
==========
Future Plans 
On June 14, 1999, DoubleClick and Abacus Direct Corporation announced their plan to merge in the third quarter of 1999.
Abacus currently maintains a database consisting of personally-identifiable information used primarily for off-line direct marketing.
DoubleClick has no rights or plans to use Abacus’ database information prior to the completion of the merger.
Upon completion of the merger, should DoubleClick ever match the non-personally-identifiable information collected by DoubleClick with Abacus’ database information, DoubleClick will revise this Privacy Statement to accurately reflect its modified data collection and data use policies and ensure that you have adequate notice of any changes and a choice to participate.
==========
If you have any additional questions, please contact us at info@doubleclick.net.
We recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as DoubleClick may update it from time to time.
