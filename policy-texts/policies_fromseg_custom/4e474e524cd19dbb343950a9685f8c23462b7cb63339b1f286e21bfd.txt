Reppublika is an online analytics and advertising toolbox launched by MindTake Research GmbH.
Its intuitive, user-friendly dashboard features an expanding range of automated research apps.
The Reppublika dashboard toolbox currently offers access to two apps: the user-centric reach and audience measurement module “Ratings+” and the module for real-time ad efficiency testing and campaign insights “Campaign Control”.
In the future, more apps will be added continuously fulfilling different research purposes.
==========
Reppublika Ratings+ calculates website and apps reach and usage and provides user structure statistics (ranked by population reach, total visits or average use time, optionally filtered by demographic attributes) in an anonymized way.
Furthermore, Reppublika Ratings+ provides media agencies, planning tools and rating services with data on national reach and user structure across the complete spectrum of digital services.
==========
Reppublika Campaign Control measures, in real-time, ad impressions and target group accuracy of a campaign, based on panel profiling data of exposed respondents.
Furthermore, it measures the effectiveness of ads of a campaign for purposes of monitoring and optimizing, through automated viewer surveys based on Key Performance Indicators such as Recall, Recognition, Appeal and Purchase Probability.
==========
How is personal data being collected
Companies (website owners or publishers) who wish to participate, can include a proprietary code, specifically a MindTake pixel tag on their website.
The code counts the number of “page impressions” of website visitors and provides Reppublika with statistical analysis and reports with aggregated results based on device type (Mobile, desktop, app), browser type (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge etc) as well the sections of a website (Events/News/Lifestyle etc).
Furthermore, through the cooperation with publishers and a third party partner online panel provider who tracks its panel members only upon their explicit prior consent through cookies or equivalent tracking software, Reppublika receives pseudonymous (data on an individual level, associated with a cookie or a device identifier but in a way that it is not reasonably possible for the individuals to be identified) and/or aggregated data (data about a group or a segment of individuals again in a way at Reppublika cannot identify each specific individual inside such a group or segment).
Members of the participating online research panel get identified each time they visit a client’s website in order to provide statistics and aggregated reports regarding the reach and demographic composition and audience profile of a website or an app.
Moreover, for the purpose of the Reppublika Campaign Control module, either through a cookie which is placed by the third-party online research panel provider on its members upon their prior explicit consent, or  through ID matching, the content that was viewed (which product, which ad campaign), on which website it was viewed and general information about the device on which the content was viewed (e.g. mobile, desktop, app) is being tracked in order to develop audience insights in connection with marketing campaigns.
Members of the third-party partner online panel provider who have seen, clicked on or otherwise interacted with an online ad or promotion are invited randomly to relevant voluntary surveys related to this experience for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of promotion and ad campaigns.
==========
Such surveys do not ask or collect any directly identifiable personal information.
What type of personal data is being collected and how is it being used
Reppublika does not identify, or attempt to identify, the individuals about whom it receives pseudonymous and aggregated measurement, reach and exposure data from the third-party online research panel provider.
Reppublika receives from the panel provider information such as the number of website visits, page impressions and visit duration as well as information regarding users’ browsing device such as device type (mobile, desktop, mobile app) operating system (Windows, MacOS, Android, ), IP address in order to determine the country from which the site is accessed, as well as information about the content that was viewed (e.g., which ad campaign), where the content was viewed (e.g., on which website or in which app).
It uses such data in order to calculate the traffic and reach of a service, the unique users, the visits and the page impressions.
==========
Reppublika only receives information in form of aggregated or pseudonymous audience statistics and not in a way that allows any individuals to be reasonably identified.
Reppublika Ratings+ uses the aforementioned information to provide audience measurement reports regarding the aggregated demographic composition of a website.
==========
Campaign Control use the aforementioned information in order to create a variety of insights and analyses about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
Reppublika only includes non-identifiable or aggregated data in its published insights, reports and analyses and presents all measurement data as part of a pool of general users.
