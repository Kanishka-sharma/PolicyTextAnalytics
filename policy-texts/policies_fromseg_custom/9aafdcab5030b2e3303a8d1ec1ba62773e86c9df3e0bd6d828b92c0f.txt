In doing so we comply with the P3P standard of the Privacy Preferences Project and always adhere strictly to current data protection directives.

Online Advertising Privacy Policy
COLLECTED INFORMATION (non PII)
The online advertising technology we are using is collecting only non-PII data, which is stored using cookies.
These cookies are saved to your web browser to help us collect information such as the web pages visited by your browser, the advertisements clicked, the items viewed in an online shop or added to an online shopping basket, etc.
We also collect information on the performance of the ads delivered, for example how many times an ad was shown to a particular browser, whether or not the ad was clicked, and if that click resulted in an online purchase.
USAGE OF THE INFORMATION
The gathered information is used to make advertisements that users are seeing on the internet more relevant to them, based on the users’ previous online behaviour.
A very simplified example are people often surfing on car sites who then get advertisement for cars even on other websites.
==========
STORAGE AND RETENTION OF DATA
Nano Interactive uses reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your data in compliance with international standards.
However a seamless protection of transmitted data cannot be guaranteed due to possible security leaks.
